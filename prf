IS IT KILLED IN WASHINGTON DC
WELL
OUR FORMULATED OF PRETTY RADICAL SERI-
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I GUESS

I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
IT IS AND
PRETTY SCARY THOUGHT TO ME EVEN
THAT'S THE GREATEST CONVICTED THERE GOES CONVICTED EVER CRIMES
RIGHT AND PUT THEM IN PRISON SYSTEM IS PROVEN NOT TO WORK
LUMBER ALL
THE MAJOR CONVICTED
I JUST LOVE THEM THOUGH
A TICKET CONVICTED AGAIN
WELL JUST TELL
WELL I THINK THAT
THE BEST HOPE
TO ELIMINATE
CRIME
AS WE KNOW TODAY
IS TO LIMIT THE CRIMINALS FROM SOCIETY
IF SOMEONE IS KNOWN TO A BIT IN PRISON THEY CAN'T GET A JOB
OH YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY
YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY THERE WERE GONNA BECOME SOCIOPATHIC
AND YOU KNOW WHO'S TO PUT THE LIMIT ON IT
I MEAN I WAS WATCHING THE THING LESS TIED UP IN WASHINGTON STATE
IF YOU GET CONVICTED OF UH
SEXUAL FENCES
ON A REGULAR BASIS I HEAR SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE FORTY YEARS OLD AND GET TEN CONVICTIONS
THEY'RE STILL OUT OUT ON THE STREET IF FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS
WELL IN WASHINGTON STATE IF YOU'RE HABITS RECYCLE CENTER
THERE'S SO MUCH OUT
LIVED YOU SERGER PRISON TERM
AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE MENTAL HOSPITAL AND IF YOU'RE PRONOUNCED HURT TO LET YOU GO
WELL
THEY MAY FIND A CURE AFFORD BUT THERE'S NO NO SURE NOW

I THINK PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES
WELL
YEAH HE IS THAT WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF THE COLOR YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS MAKE THEM SLAVE OF THE PEOPLE THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME I GUESS
YOU KNOW
SO THERE'S A MIGHT BE SOME BENEFIT AND THAT AND IF THE PEOPLE WHO THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME AGAINST
FEEL IT SOME LATER DATE THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED A LESSON OR OR OKAY YOU KNOW WELL THEY CAN FROM THAT
BUT UH YOU KNOW WITH JUST THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY YOU CAN PUT A COLLAR ARE GUYS LEG
THAT WILL NOT FROM DOWN THERE THEY LEAVE THE PROPERTY
MAYBE THEY'LL JUST INCAPACITATED
AND YOU WOULD CALL UH GUYS LEGS
THAT WILL
PRO HIM BUT UH
FROM COMMITTING ANY KIND OF
YOU KNOW FOR THE BACK
BUT YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM IN PRISON MY GOD THAT DOESN'T WORK
WELL YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE TURKEY

YOU LOOK AT THEIR SOCIETY AND THEY'RE REPEAT OFFENDERS ARE VERY FEW
YOU KNOW AND YOU LOOK AT OUR SOCIETY
ALMOST EVERYONE OUT ON THE STREET
THAT HAS BEEN IN PRISON THAT IN PRISON THREE OR FOUR TIMES
RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW THE WAY TO STOP THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR
IS THERE'S TWO POLES
LONG
NEED TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR
BOTH PARENTS TO WORK WELL THE KIDS ARE UNDER SEVEN
I- I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
AND THEN
IF THE PARENTS AS PROVED TO BE ON FOR THAT
FOR ANY REASON
TAKE THE KIDS AWAY FROM THE PARENTS
BECAUSE
YOU KNOW WE ARE WE TEACH
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE SOCIETY BECAUSE UH WE HAVE A JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
UH I'VE I'VE LIVED IN THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS WHEN I WAS THE INSTRUCTOR WORK
YOU KNOW AND THESE GUYS THAT COME TO WORK OR MORE THAN THEIR STALLS OF THE BALL
WE- THAT'S SO HIGH THAT CAN FLY UP TO THE TOP OF THE
AT WORK ALL DAY AND IN THE HOME AT A SMOKER OPEN DIRECTOR BLUES AND SHOOT DIRT ROADS
AND WHATEVER UM UH THEY THEY GO DOWN THERE OR STORE AND POP THE GUY THAT THEY GET MONEY AND THEN I GO BACK TO WORK ON ONE
AND THE KIDS OF THESE PEOPLE

YOU PUT
THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THAT SMALL THE SPACE THEY'VE LEARNED TO LIVE TOGETHER
OKAY IT'S IN THEIR CULTURE UM-HUM
AND ONE OF THINGS AND THEY'RE CALLED FOR THAT I REALLY THINK THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS THAT THING TO DO IS THE FACT THAT WHILE JAPAN WAS BECOMING A GREAT OUR FINANCIALLY

IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE REALLY GOOD IDEA
UM-HUM
UM-HUM

WELL
I THINK OF HOW YOU MEAN AS FAR AS RETIREMENT
I THINK THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME RIGHT NOW DO YOU USE REALLY THE MEDICAL COVERAGE
UM
YEAH AND AND UH
AND THEN INVOLVED IN A 401K PLAN ON UH COUNTRY BEING SUCH AND SUCH A SMALL NOW RIGHT NOW
JUST TO GO AHEAD HAVE YOU CAN OPEN BECAUSE UM
UH
I JUST SEE I'VE BEEN WITH THIS COMPANY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND BEFORE THAT

WE'RE WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO CATCH UP
WE WERE WE WERE WAY BEHIND FINANCIALLY AND SO I HAVEN'T REALLY UH QUITE AN AGE TO CATCH UP YET
EXACTLY AND WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE WHICH COMPLICATES MATTERS EVEN HARDER
YEAH
NO
NOW THAT WOULD COMPLICATE IT EVEN THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WELL THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT THERE
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY HAS TO USED TO BE THAT THEY USED TO GET LIKE TWO WEEKS A YEAR AND NOW THEY GIVE ONE WEEK AFTER THE FOR SIX MONTHS
MOST MOST THE TIME NOW THEY DO THE FIRST WEEK AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS SO THAT IF SOMEBODY REALLY NEAT THAT TIME
THEY CAN GO HITTING YOU COULD YOU KNOW THEY CAN JUST WAIT THE FULL YEAR AND YOU HAVE T-
SO WHERE IT WOULD WORK AT WAY
PROBABLY FIVE YEARS I THINK
OR SEVEN
UH THAT'S KIND OF FAR AWAY
OKAY UM
I'VE GOT ANOTHER CALL COMING IN
OH OKAY ALL RIGHT BYE-BYE
RIGHT
YEAH
WELL I GUESS UH IT
I'M I'M KIND OF AN UNUSUAL SITUATION PROBABLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC BECAUSE I'M SELF EMPLOYED
UM
BUT YES I HAVE WORKED I WORK FOR TI AND I WORK FOR LTD
UM AND I SUPPOSE THAT SO
SO FAR AS BENEFITS ARE CONCERNED THE MOST IMPORTANT UH
TO ME DID THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE OF SOMETHING TO DO WITH RETIREMENT BENEFITS
AT AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE SO I'M I'M I'M A LITTLE OLDER PROBABLY THAN YOU KNOW THEN THE TYPICAL NEW EMPLOYEE WOULD BE ANYWAY UH
I- IN YOU KNOW IN MY YOUNGER DAYS AFTER I WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT'S THE VACATION POLICY
AND THEN AS I MATURED A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATER THE INSURANCE BENEFITS  YOU KNOW
BUT UH SO I I KNOW I GUESS IT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT DEPENDS ON
UH YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE IN LIFE AS TO WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
AND
YEAH
YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT UH IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK FORWARD TO W- YOU KNOW FORTY YOU GONNA DO WHEN YOU RETIRE
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT THEN IT GETS TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU GOT TO BE SOME PLANNING FOR IT BUT YOU KNOW IF THE ESPECIALLY THE COMPANY'S NOT DOING FOR YOU
AND UH
UH THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT DO AND THEIR COMPANIES THAT DON'T UH YOU KNOW THAT DON'T HAVE GOOD RETIREMENT PLAN
UH
I GUESS UH THE COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE A PAID IN THE 401K TYPE PLANS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE THE UH OPTION OF CONTRIBUTING TO UH TO RETIREMENT PLAN
AND UH MAYBE EVEN THE COMPANY DOES SOME KIND OF A MATCHING PROGRAM FOR THAT THAT'S THOSE ARE GOOD PROGRAMS UH
UH UM I'M A CPA SO I LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW I GET TO SEE A LOT OF THESE UH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THINGS AND ALONG THAT LINE
AND UH I LIKE TO SEE WHERE THE COMPANY MAKES THOSE MAKES BENEFITS AVAILABLE AT LEAST TO THE EMPLOYEES
SO THAT THEY CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT THEY LIKE UH
YOU KNOW THERE'S THEY'VE GOT ONE THAT THEY CALL A CAFETERIA PLAN OR YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT OR NOT
AND UH IT'S INITIALLY THE CAFETERIA PLANS ARE PROGRAMS WHERE
THE COMPANY MAKES AVOIDABLE AT A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT PACKAGES OF BENEFITS YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN PICK THE KIND OF INSURANCE YOU WALL THE KIND OF DENTAL COVERAGE AND IT KIND OF VACATION POLICY YOU WON'T
AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU PICK THE ONES THAT YOU WANT AS LONG AS THE TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY ESSENTIALLY THE TOTAL COST OF THE COMPANY
GETS YOU KNOW WITHIN THEIR GUIDELINES SO EVERY EMPLOYEE GETS THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT BENEFITS
BUT THEY CAN PICK THEM FROM DIFFERENT WHATEVER IS MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM
SO YOU CAN THAT'S SO YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET THE INSURANCE PLAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND SOMEBODY ELSE CAN GET THE VACATION PLAN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY YOU KNOW
AND THE COMPANY WINDS UP PAYING THE SAME YOU KNOW THE SAME AMOUNT LEAVE THEM
UH I BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN EAT YOU CAN CHANGE WHAT MAYBE NOT FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN CHANGE PERIODICALLY
UH AS TO YOU KNOW IS TO GET THE STUFF IT'S WARM FORTY YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE UH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW PUT INTO UH YOU KNOW AND THE THE IRS REGULATIONS AS A AS
OF DEDUCTIONS UH ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS FOR COMPANIES THEY PUT THOSE IN OH FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO UH YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THINGS STARTED PROMOTING THOSE PLAN
AND UH I- I THINK THEY'RE YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY GOOD OPTION TO HIM
OF COURSE A 401- 401K IS IS A GOOD YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD SAVINGS VEHICLE
SO
ANYWAY UH
WHAT KIND OF PLANS ARE YOU ARE YOU IN OUR WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN IN BEFORE
WELL AS FAR AS BENEFITS PACKAGE IS INDEED AND TOTAL
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S UH THAT'S UH UH A HASSLE TRYING TO TO UH
THEY DON'T PUT YOUR MONEY ALL IN THE RIGHT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IN THE RIGHT POCKETS I GUESS IT WOULD BE A WAY TO SAVE
YOU KNOW TO GET EVERYTHING DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND UH SO THAT I GUESS THE UH
YOU KNOW THEY THE THE OF THE MEDICAL INSURANCE WOULD REALLY BE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT IF YOU HAD UH IF YOU HAD CHILDREN I GUESS IF YOU'RE CHILDBEARING AGE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW BECAUSE
YEAH BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE UH AT LEAST HAVE THE COVERAGE IN CASE THAT YEAR IN CASE YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR I HAVE A CHILD
AND UH
YOU WON'T HAVE THE COVERAGE UH
WE- YEAH
THE WHAT ELSE
YEAH UM I GUESS UH WHAT WHAT KIND OF TYPICAL VACATION

BECAUSE YOU GET EVERYTHING OUT AND HE LOVES TO SEE THEM EAT THAT HE GETS EVERY SEASONING OUT OF THE CUPBOARD YOU KNOW USES IT AND HE LIKES TO PUT LEMON
I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT PEOPLE POOR RICO PHIL- UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UH THE POSSIBILITY OF WORRY TO BECOME A STATE
YEAH WELL I QUESTION WHETHER IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS TO BECOME A STATE RIGHT NOW THEY ARE COMMONWEALTHS
AND THAT MEANS THEY ARE UNDER US PROTECTION IN THE EVENTS OF UH THE DEPENDING THEIR THEIR COUNTRY
UH THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY GOING PRIVILEGES SO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE ANY REPRESENTATION CONGRESS
YEAH I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO PAY ANY UH LIKE FEDERAL TAXES UH
UH YEAH I THINK THEY ARE THEY THE TO GET UH P- PRIVILEGES LIKE THAT
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT UH CARES ON
OH I THINK THEY'VE GOT UH UH LIKE A LANGUAGE BARRIER TOO I THINK MOST PEOPLE THEIR SPEAK ONLY SPANISH I'M NOT SURE HOW FLUENT THEY ARE IN ENGLISH
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS I'VE I SEE WITH UH
OTHER COUNTRIES AS SUCH BEING A SAVE THE POSSIBLY BECOMING STATES THAT WE DON'T HAVE A COMMON LANGUAGE WITH THEM
RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM SAY WITH MEXICO
UH CAN'T ON THE OTHER HAND UH ENGLISH IS ONE OF THEIR NASH LANGUAGES THEY HAVE
YEAH UH-HUH
SO I THINK THERE'S
YEAH
I JUST SEE A LOT OF UH SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES THAT COULD UH POSE PROBLEMS WITH UH PORT RECO- BECOMING STATE
UM
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE STRONG ENOUGH MYSELF TO BECOME INDEPENDENT
UH I THINK IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST RIGHT NOW JUST UH TOURING AS IT IS
KEEP THE STATUS QUO- AND UH KEEP A STANDARD UNITED STATES PROTECTION
YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF THEY IF THEY TRIED FOR INDEPENDENCE THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE UH
MILITARY FACTIONS THAT OPPOSE EACH OTHER AND AND THEY WOULD PFEIFFER LEADERSHIP AND UH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF THEIR THE MIDDLE UPPER CLASSES THERE IS SUCH A THING
OH THEY WOULD PROBABLY GET A DISADVANTAGE LOSING POSSIBLY LOSING THEIR UH THEIR ASSETS OR WELL
UM
I DON'T SEE IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE
YEAH WELL I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE I'M NOT QUITE FAMILIAR WITH WITH UH WITH THE TWO THINGS
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL I THINK THAT'LL BE A PART OF THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT THEY STILL REALLY OUR THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
AND THEY HAVEN'T UH CAUGHT UP UH ECONOMICALLY WITH UH SAY THE UNITED STATES
UH-HUH
OKAY
WELL DID YOU HAVE GUIDES FROM THE AREA OR ESCORTS OR
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT THAT LETTING BLOOD THEY GET FIRED UP ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING ANYWAY
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF UH ATTAINING EXCEPT FOR STATE IS WHAT WE DO ABOUT OUR FLAG IDEAR RANGE FIFTY ONE STARS
WHAT KIND OF PATTERN JUST DO COME UP WITH FOR THAT
THAT CONTEST
WELL UH GIVE THEM THE MORE OF AN INTEREST IN WHAT GOES ON IN THIS COUNTRY
IF IF THEY HAD UH A AT A UH A PRIVILEGE OF VOTING
UH GIVE THEM VESTED INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT AND UH
I WOULD SEE THAT AS AS A POSITIVE OF THING FOR THEM TO CONSIDER
PROBABLY
UH YEAH I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE
MY KIDS CLOSER
RIGHT
THAT IS A GOOD DISTANCE
WHAT IS THEIR MAJOR INDUSTRY
IS THAT UH I BELIEVE THE CHURCH TEAM OR I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH WITH TO STAY THERE OUT AGRICULTURE
RIGHT YOU HAVE TO QUESTION
I HAVE TO WONDER HOW MUCH TILLABLE LAND THEY HAVE UH BEING AN ISLAND
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YEAH I I MUST HAVE A LOT OF TOURISM TOO BUT I DON'T SEE AS MUCH ADVERTISING THERE AS YOU DO IN THE BA- THE TO THE BAHAMAS
BUT UH THE THE SAINT THOMAS UH VIRGIN ISLANDS UH PLACES LIKE THAT
RIGHT WELL VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE AMERICAN TERRITORY
OKAY SO I GUESS UM
I- I START WITH MAYBE IF IT'S GONNA DO YOU KNOW IF THE POPULATION FAVORS STATEHOOD THERE
WELL WE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO WHETHER WE PAY FOR IT
WELL SEE I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS BECAUSE UM IT IT IT WAS FINANCIAL SITUATION I DON'T REALLY QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE IF THEY WOULD BE A BURDEN TO US
WELL IF THEY ARE ARE BURDEN
SO I- I REALLY
LET'S SEE I REALLY DON'T CARE YOU KNOW THEY NEED
YES THAT I THINK THAT'S TRUE SO THAT MAKES THEM FEEL DEFINITELY LIKE OUTSIDERS
ARE THEY GETTING BACK TO THEIR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
THEY THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF UH TAX BENEFITS
YEAH SO I'M ALSO COURSE THEY THEY CAN THEY JOIN THE THEY COULD ALWAYS TRIED THE MILITARY SE- SE- ARE CONSIDERED CITIZENS I BELIEVE
YEAH THEY CAN
YEAH THAT'S A STRANGE TUITION YOU YOU'RE SUSAN YEAH YOU CAN'T PULL
S- S- SO IT'S
YEAH I- I WORKED ON I WENT THERE FOR A CLASS IN A FACTORY
AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MY CLASS WOULDN'T SPEAK FLUID ENGLISH THEY HAD VERY DIFFICULT TIME THAT THEY THEY COULDN'T THE ONES THAT COULD SPEAK
THINK IT HAD A REALLY HARD TIME READING IT SO
YES IT'S ALL THE THE THE UM
THE QUEBEC PEOPLE THAT THAT SPEAK FRENCH
AND THERE'S
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BUT
BUT UM
IT'S PRETTY WELL DO YOU UM DO YOU DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BECOME INDEPENDENT MANY OR DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD I THINK THAT'S
YEAH I THINK IF I WOULD SAY NO LAST BORDER YOU SHOULDN'T BE THAT THAT WOULD BE UM STAPLE LISTENING TO JAIL
THEY WOULD
YES
SO THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME DO YOU THINK THEY COULD NEVER AND SO I DON'T
WELL THERE'S A LOT O- ONE OF THESE THREE CHOICES
I DON'T BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT REA- I READ THIS TEN YEARS AGO THEY WERE HAVING THESE BIG THOUGH
RAT RACE IN PEOPLE BEING THE STREETS LASTING SCIENCE DAVID YES AND THEY PEOPLE IT'S DOWN THE STATE BUT
IT'S IT DOWN THERE A FEW ON FAMILIAR WITH THEIR POLITICS
THEY UH
IT'S VERY UM BUT I DID NOT CALL LAST YOU KNOW THERE'S A HOBBY LOUDSPEAKERS ON THEIR CARS AND THEY RUN DOWN THE NEIGHBORHOODS SAYING VOTE FOR YOU KNOW P- AREAS THERE UH BUT UH
PAY DRUG USE THE BASS IT IT'S REALLY KIND OF CLASSICAL
YEAH THESE THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE BIG LOUDSPEAKERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE UH
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM JUST LIKE CARS PRETTY LIKE THERE MAY YEARS IN THEIR COUNCILMENS IT'S REALLY KIND OF FUNNY IT'S IT'S KIND OF AN INVASION OF YOUR PRIVACY THROUGH THEIR SCHOOLING INDUSTRIES IS REALLY LAB SPEAKERS

NO LET'S GO INTO TEACHING IT'S IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS
UM ACTUALLY WE UM THAT SOME PEOPLE THAT WE'RE IN THE NAVAL BASE DOWN THERE
AND UH THEY DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKES LIVING DOWN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS VERY FORD VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE PEOPLE
THEY THEY DIDN'T TREAT THE NICE THING IS THOUGH OLD SO I THINK THEY'RE I WHAT I LEARNED AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF RESENTMENT COURTS AMERICANS
SO IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE AIRPORT RICAN WORM THEIR KIDS
SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO UM EMOTIONAL ABOUT ABOUT WAS STATEHOOD YET LIKE YOU SAY IT'S
THEY CAN'T REALLY SUPPORT THEMSELVES SO
YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
WELL THAT THAT'S A GOOD ONE
YEAH I WOULD THINK IT IT IT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THE MOST IS
THEY DON'T MAKE A DECISION I DON'T KNOW I- I THINK IF THEY VOTED THAT AS YOU SAY THAT UM
THEY THEY WOULD PROBABLY STATE COMMONWEALTH THERE THAT WOULD BE THE BEST FOR THEM
YEAH
UH IT'S A IT'S TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT CULTURES
I DO- I DON'T KNOW
UM SO YOU LIKE IT SAYS RING THIS TEN YEARS AGO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS ANOTHER TEN YEARS
I DON'T EVEN DOING ANYTHING
SO
I DIDN'T KNOW AND IT'S ALSO A LONG WAY AWAY
IT'S YOU KNOW IF IT WAS TOO HUH
THAT'S GOOD WAS REALLY CLOSE IT BUT UH OF COURSE IT'S IT'S IT'S LIKE A I LIVE IN VERMONT FROM VERMONT AFFORD IT IT'S ANOTHER
ANOTHER TAUGHT WHAT FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILES ACROSS THE OCEAN
WELL
BUT UH THAT'S A THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR OWN
CEREALS AND THINGS THAT I DON'T DO STAND THAT WAY THEY DON'T HAVE A PROCESSING I GUESS
BUT YET THEY IT'S JUST TOO YOU BRING TO US YOU'RE REALLY IN BOXES IS IT IS TO BRING IT IN AND YOU KNOW WELL GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IT THERE
OH I REALLY DON'T KNOW UM
IT COULD BE I'M SURE THEY REALIZE HEAVILY IN PRISON AND EVEN AT THE UH THE AMERICAN COMPANIES DOWN THERE WITH THEIR UH ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY IN PHARMACEUTICALS REPEAT DOWN THERE
THAT'S ONE THING I DID I ALWAYS THOUGHT PHARMACEUTICALS ELECTRONICS THAT THAT MAKES UP GOING ON AND OFF TO BE LIKE EIGHT OR TEN PERCENT OF THEIR BUSINESS
BUT UM I REALLY DON'T KNOW I- I RECALL TRULY THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME NOT CH- AND AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T SEEM TO UH I DON'T KNOW IF I HEARD THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES OR NOT I DON'T THINK THEY SUPPORT THEMSELVES
IN OUR COUNTRY I FOUND THAT TO BE REALLY UH IT'S
WELL I KNOW YOU SEE THESE BIG ROAD CRANES I MEAN YOU'RE THAT HAD THE I GUESS THERE'S GREENS DON'T DO WELL THE TRAP THAT IT'S
SO LIKE YOU SAY THE BOAT GROW SUGAR BEETS AND SUGAR TEAM NUTSO EXPLORE
WELL YEAH THAT IS IT'S NOT IN THIS DAY AND UH BUT IT
IT LOOKS FERTILE AND THAT THAT UM I MEAN IT RAINS OUT THEY HAVE THE CLUB AND THE RAIN
IT IT'S NOT IT'S LIKE A BENEFIT THOMASES JUST STARTS FROM THE OCEAN A-
AND IT'S VERY IT'S LIKE ONE BIG ROCKS BOUGHT A QUARTER RICO HAVE LOTS OF LAW
LOTS OF THEM NOW THIS REGION A- AND UH CLOSE TO LOSE IT
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
THAT'S VERY TRUE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY JUST
TAKE IT FOR GRANTED YOU YOU KNOW IT'S AN AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH THEY REALLY DO WELL HOPPED OUT BECAUSE THAT MUCH BUT I IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT
BUT I- I BELIEVE IT'S A VERY POPULAR VACATION DESTINATION
YEP
SO THEY'RE EQUITY THINK UM
HUM
YEAH
YOU THINK THAT THEY DID THOSE PRODUCTS SHOULD COST MORE
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH  UM-HUM WELL DO THEY I MEAN UM I NEVER LIKE DOING THAT AND I- I DIDN'T UP UNTIL UH SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE POINT OF
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO HAVE A CAR AND YOU HAVE DONE CHILI AND YEAH
IT KEEPS EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TRYING TO DO THINGS LIKE MY HOUSE
REALLY I MEAN  SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT
YEAH I DID IS JUST THAT UH
DID NEEDS TO BE SOME SOME CHANGE TAKE PLACE SO THAT THE INERTIA CAN BEGIN TO GO AND DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS STRAIGHT DOWN
YOU KNOW  THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT THINK WE HAVE
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL WE WERE WE WERE IN DEBT BEFORE THAT IT JUST WASN'T AS A PARENT
NOW WE STILL
I GUESS BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRIES THAT WE WERE HOPING WERE WERE EVENTUALLY GOING TO PAY IT BACK
AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S TRUE HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH
IN SOME IN SOME CASES IT IT UH THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY GOING TOO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT IT'S INTENDED FOUR IN OTHER CASES
UH IT'S IT'S ALL BASED USES ALL UP TO ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CONTROL DOWN IN SOME CASES THAT THE MONEY ACTUALLY DOES FILTERED DOWN TO THE TOOLS FOR IT
SUPPOSED TO GET TOO AND IN OTHER CASES IT IT DOES NOT
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD SOLUTION TO BUDGET THINGS YOU CARE FOR THAT UH I KNOW THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BE THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY TRYING TO BE FAIRLY TAXES AND BY MAKING IT MORE EQUAL
BUT
I CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
PROBLEM HAS TO BE THE SAME PERCENTAGE WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT MAKES
UM A VERY LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY THE SAME PERCENTAGE THEY EFFECTS IN THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY EIGHT TIMES MORE SEVERELY BEEN THE SAME PERCENTAGE
DRUG SOMEONE'S WELL IF IF THEY ARE IN A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I WOULD JUST BEING SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE FEEL LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE FAIR TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE HAVE WE WAITED
TOWARD THE COPY AND A FI- I CAN PUT MY YOU KNOW I THINK TO MYSELF IF I HAD THAT MUCH MONEY
I COULD AFFORD TO PAY MORE TAXES DO WOULDN'T BOTHER ME I BET
YEAH THEY USED TO HAVE THEM WHAT ARE THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS THAT THEY USED TO BE TAXED THIRTY PERCENT
AND I REMEMBER HEARING AND HEAVY WITH UM WITH THE MAN WHO INVENTED HAWAIIAN TROPIC
YOU KNOW AND HE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT NOBODY WENT BROKE OVER PAINT THIRTY PERCENT
YOU KNOW
WELL BUT
THEY TAKE IT IT IT IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE LIKE SWEDEN THEY PAY A LOT IN TEXAS BUT THEIR DAY CARE IS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED
WE NEED TO WANT TO STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN ARE SUBSIDIZED TO DO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UM
TENDS TO MY HOUSE BECAUSE IT THE GOVERNMENT THERE IN THE COUNTRY THERE HAS PLACED A VERY SIGNIFICANT VALUE ON MOTHERHOOD
I THINK WE COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM AND AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM YOU MAY PAY MORE IN TAXES BUT YOUR HEALTH CARE IS TAKING CARE UM AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE CORRUPTION AND AND UM
THEY JUST SEND IT THAT WE HAVE HERE WITH THE THE AVERAGE CHARGES AND
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT IF WE COULD MODEL
YOU KNOW PROGRAMS AFTER THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY I MEAN THEY DID A LOT OF WORK AND FINDING A PROGRAM THAT WORKED AND IF WE WERE TO DO THE RESEARCH TAKE STANDARDIZED WHAT THEY HAVE
ALREADY WORKING AND MY DAD DID
THAT THAT THAT PARTICULAR DAY CARE SYSTEM UM WORK VERY WELL AND THE CANADIAN HEALTH PLAN IS PROBABLY THE BEST ONE IN EXISTENCE TODAY
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE LONG TERM EFFECTS IN THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS IN TERMS OF FOOD BALANCING BUDGET AND SO FORTH UM
I TEND TO VIEW  UH MEXICAN FAIRLY RADICALS YOU'D TOWARDS ECONOMIC POLICY AND FILLS UP
WELL IT HAS TO BE DONE SOMEWHAT ARBITRARILY THAT HA- ARE IN THE SUMMERS INSTANCES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SHOULD COST UM REAL TOTAL COST RATHER THAN JUST MANUFACTURING COST
AND THAT MEANS UH IF YOU HOPE PURDUE SOMETHING THAT CREATES A UH UH I HAD HERSELF THE FACTS THAT SHOULD SOMEHOW BE REFLECTED IN THE PRODUCT IF YOU UH DO YOU COST OF
FORESTRY YOU CUT DOWN SUCH NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW REFLECTED
YES
WELL I THINK I THINK MY A LONG TERM SENSE OF THOSE BUDGET CONCERNS IS THAT WE'RE GOING IS
A LOT OF LOTUS GOVERNMENT SPENDING GOES ON AND THOSE SORTS IS A HEALTH CARE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND A LOT OF CAUSES THE POOR HEALTH OR NEED FOR HEALTH CARE OR
BROUGHT THEM ALL BY VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS SUCH AS POLLUTION STRESS AT WORK WORK ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS AND SO FORTH BUT GENERALLY THE GOVERNMENT AS
GOVERNMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WE PAID FOR THAT RATHER THAN THE UH SOME OF THE SOURCE OF NEED FOR THE HEALTH CARE
UM BUT THAT'S A VERY LONG TERM SORT OF CONCERN
OH I DON'T I DON'T HAVE GREAT SHORT TERM EFFECTS AS AN REDUCING SPENDING AND RAISING TAXES AND THE LIKE CITY RAISING TAXES VERY MUCH AND UH
NO LEXUSES PRODUCING SPENDING VERY MUCH SO I DON'T SEE ANY REAL THE REAL IMMEDIATE HOPE PRINCIPLE CALLED IS THAT THEY AREN'T THAT UH THAT THEY BUY THINGS ON CREDIT CARDS
UM-HUM
YEAH I WAS I WAS
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YES WELL I I DON'T KNOW ANYONE PAID CASH FOR A HOUSE THAT'S FOR SURE  YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH UH-HUH BYE

MOSTLY GET IN JUST THAT THAT REGION NEVER HAD THAT THE UN AS FAR BACK IN THOSE TIMES IT'S NEVER BEEN PEACEFUL
YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST DON'T LIKE THE JUICE AND YOU DON'T LIKE THE ARABS AND THEN HAVE TWO OF THEM OUT THERE
WELL NO BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THE MID EAST HAS THE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND I I THINK THEY'RE LATER THEY'RE LATER LITERATURE SO LOW BUT THERE'S STILL A STUDENT TROUBLE MENTALITY

WHICH HAS TROUBLE MENTALITY THEY'LL TYPE OCCURRED SHIITE MUSLIMS OR WHATEVER BUT IT'S BASICALLY ALL ALL BASED ON A TROUBLE NETWORK
UH SOME AGREE YEAH SOME DEGREE BUT UH RELIGION IS A FACTOR OVER THERE BUT UH I THINK THE STRONGEST FACTORIES A PRIVATE THE FAMILY
WELL THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBABLY DO YOU ALL BE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS CHRISTIANITY AND THEN YOU REALLY HAVE SUBDIVIDED BAPTISTS AND LUTHERANS AND PROTESTANTS CHRISTIANS AND CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IS TO IT'S BASICALLY ALL THE SAME
UM BUT BUT HE MUSCLES ARE NOT AS LIBERAL AND INTERPRETATION OF OF THE KOREAN AS WE ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THE BIBLE

RIGHT
HE'S GOT CALLED
SO I'M NOT STANDING OUT IN THE NEXT TIME TO GET SHELLED
SO THAT
YEAH
I SEE
I GUESS ROOMS SIERRA'S GOT ENTIRELY NEW ATTITUDE THE SEASON

ONE GUNS ALL IT'S
YEAH HE LIKES TO BE UH UP AND COMING A PERFORMER
W- WE GIVEN THE RANGERS HISTORY THEY'LL PROBABLY TRADE HIM
AND THEN IT WITH THEM AT ALL
RIGHT SOMEWHERE OUT SO
THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE WAY THE RAIDERS OPERATE
HOW DIFFICULT WAS GONNA DO
FOR WHAT THEY'RE PAYING THEY OUGHT TO GET YOU KNOW TO GET THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE GUYS UH BACK
AND SAY BECAUSE MAKING FIVE MILLION A YEAR
YEAH
YEAH I AGREE
I THINK IT IS IN WHEN WHEN THE PLAYERS AND SELLS ARE TURNING DOWN CONTRACTS OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS IN DURATION FOR THREE OR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR LOOKING FOR MORE MONEY YET
SURE
WELL IT'S IT'S A BIDDING WAR BETWEEN TEAMS THAT'S ALSO POPULARITY CONTEST BETWEEN S- TO SEE YOU CAN GET THE BIGGEST UH PAYCHECK
BECAUSE BASEBALL LEAN
THAT'S TRUE THEY KEEP RAISING TICKET PRICES EVERY YEAR
YEAH AND WITH WHAT THOSE GUYS GET PAID THEN THEY GO OUT UH BESIDES BASEBALL AND AND UH ADVERTISE PRODUCTS OR THEY THEY CHARGE TEN OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER AUTOGRAPH
THEY'VE GOT ALL THE SUPPLEMENT INCOME COMING IN IS THAT THEY'RE MAKING ENOUGH ALREADY HAS UH STARTED THE SPORT
YEAH
SURE YEAH I MIGHT GET MAYBE ONE GAME OUT OF YEAR IN PERSON UH BUT UH HAVING CABLE TV AND HSE UH
YEAH I'LL WATCH QUITE A FEW GAMES ON TV
ESPECIALLY TO SEE SOME LIKE NOLAN PITCH

AND UH HE HAD A TOWARD ROTATOR CUFF
SO HE'S OUT FOR AT LEAST UH WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WEEKS FOR MONTHS IT'S UH
BUT HE MAY NOT PITCH THE SEASON AGAIN
HE'S THE STAR THAT UH TEAM THEY'RE PITCHING STAFF AND WHEN HE SITS OUT THE CIVIL
THAT SEEMS TYPICAL BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR OTHER STARS UH PAUL MOLITOR IS USUALLY ABOUT HALF THE SEASONS INJURIES AND SO
YEAH WELL THEN THE JUGGLING THE LINEUP AND TRYING TO FIT UH IT MORE IN EXPERIENCED PLAYERS INTO THOSE ROLES AND THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE LEADERSHIP DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO CARRY TEAM
I THINK WE FIND I'M READY FOR BASEBALL SEASON STARTS
YEAH UH I AGREE WITH THAT
RIGHT ON THE PRESEASON REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING EITHER
THE PLAY THE TEAMS UH USUALLY PLAY IN SPLIT SQUADS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE PLAYING THE ROCKIES OR THEIR UH
UM THAT WAY
YEAH
ONCE A SEASON GETS UNDERWAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT THERE TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TRYING WHEN GAMES
THE TAKE FROM THERE
OKAY WELL GOOD LUCK TO THE RANGERS THE SEASON  IF THEY CAN FOLLOW NOT WITH
ALL RIGHT HERE THANKS BYE
OKAY WHAT IS YOUR UH GENERAL OPINION THE END OF THE TAXES FOR THE AMERICAN SO
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT YEAH UM
DOESN'T MATTER FACT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE THE TAX SITUATION IN TEXAS BECAUSE THE THE SCHOOLS OR NOT
THEY'RE NOT EQUITABLE WITHIN THE STATE SO THEY'RE CHANGE BUT THE TIME I CHANGE IN THE UH THE TAX BASE AND HOW THE TAX YOU DISTRIBUTED SCHOOLS WHICH WILL PROBABLY MAIN UH ANOTHER INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAXES
EITHER THAT OR ARE THE THE STARTING A STATE INCOME TAX
UM-HUM
YEAH
ALMOST FULL RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S IT'S A POSSIBILITY
UH THAT I UNDERSTAND IT MARYLAND DOES NOT HAVE ANY OF THE STATE INCOME TAX THAT RIGHT
OH OKAY SO
OKAY THEN UH ALL OF YOUR STATE INCOME TAX IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
OKAY DID YOU LIVE IN TEXAS AFTER THE UH BY AFTER THEY STOPPED LETTING YOU DEDUCTION THOUGH UH SALES TAX ON YOUR TAX RETURN
OKAY SO SO YOU COULDN'T DEDUCT STATE INCOME UH STATE SALES TAX WHEN YOU LIVE IN TEXAS
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SITUATIONS
UM-HUM
YEAH
RIGHT
NO HUH-UH
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING UH INTERESTING CONCEPT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT A A YOU KNOW THAT THAT TRIED I GUESS HIM IN A SENSE
I GUESS THE UH YOU KNOW THE IDEA IS THAT UH THE MORE PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN THE FAMILY THE MORAL PLAN ON SEES YOU NEED YOU KNOW THE MORE UH CAPABILITY YOU NEED TO DO
PAPER FOOD IN CLOTHING AND STUFF FOR THEM SO THAT THEY GIVE YOU MORAL OUNCES MORE DEPENDENT ALLOWANCES FOR THAT
BUT UH YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THE
YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YOU KNOW IF I GUESS UH IN ONE THOUGHT THAT OCCURRED IN THE UH THAT IS WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A NATIONAL UH MILITARY OR PUBLIC SERVICE DEAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
AND MAYBE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT COULD REPLACE SOME OF THE UH WELFARE PROGRAMS
BUT IF UH YOU KNOW FOR GOING TO DO THAT THAT WE DON'T REALLY GET SOME BENEFIT DOLLAR BENEFITS OUT OF IT THAT THAT TO REDO YOU SPENDING IN SOME OTHER AREAS UH
YOU KNOW THE DO SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE WHAT THE WHAT THEY REFER TO AS TRANSFER PAYMENTS
BECAUSE UH THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHERE A REAL YOU KNOW THE REAL PROBLEM WITH GOVERNMENT IS NOT IS NOT WHAT THE NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DOING THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO
TO UH
NOT DO AS WELL AS THEY CAN YOU KNOW UH NOT HAVE AS MUCH OUTPUT AND
ALL THAT YOU'RE PAYING PEOPLE NOT TO WORK AND YOU'RE PAYING PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE KIDS AND YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW MORE DID YOU HAVE THE MORE DEPENDENT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE ALLOWANCES YOU GET
AND UH
THE MORE YOU HAVE THE MORE UH A PAID FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN YOU CAN GET AND ALL THESE THINGS GO INTO IT SO
BUT UH SOME KIND OF A NATIONAL SERVICE OF CONCEPT THAT MIGHT BE GEARED AROUND REDUCING THAT WOULD BE UH I THINK WOULD BE A BIG STEP
RIGHT
RIGHT THAT UH
RIGHT
YEAH I- I THINK THAT UH A BIG PART OF THE UH YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT CONCEPT OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAS BEEN UH RE- DISTRIBUTION OF UH OF WEALTH IN IN EFFECT
UH YOU KNOW YOU YOU TAX THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MOST AND THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING GET IT FOR NOTHING
AND UH AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY MYSELF BUT UH
KIND OF RAINS OF YOU KNOW SOCIALISM AND
AND I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THE AMERICAN LEADERS OF SEEM TO THINK THAT THAT'S THE WAY TO GO BUT
UH THEY'RE NOT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT FEEL THAT WAY IT LOOK WHAT THEY CAN GET SUPPORT FOR
OR MAKING THE AMERICAN SYSTEM WORK THE WEIGHTS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO
UM
I DON'T THINK THAT I'M PAYING TOO MANY TAX YOU KNOW TOO MUCH TAX MYSELF
UM I UH AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW FEDERAL IN STATE UM THE UH UH THE STATE I LIVE IN HALF THE FIVE PERCENT SALES TAX
OH THAT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN UH TAXES I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN OUTSIDE OF TEXAS BUT UH
WHEN I MOVED TO TEXAS I WAS TOLD OH WELL THERE'S NO PERSONAL INCOME TAX WELL THEY NAIL YOU OWN PROPERTY TAXES AND UH TEXAS AND AND THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THE SCHOOLS AND SO
YEAH I- I FOUND INTERESTING UM WHEN I MOVED TO TEXAS THE FACT THAT UH THE REASON PEOPLE WANTING TO GET THEIR KIDS IN THE PLANO WAS TO GO TO THE PLANO SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE MONEY THAN YOU KNOW OTHER PLACES
AND UH I JUST UH
AT THE UH LIKE HERE IN MARYLAND UH I'VE JUST BOUGHT A UH A HOUSE FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND THERE'D BE ABOUT SIXTY SELF DOWN THERE  AND UM
THE TAX BASIS IS ACTUALLY UM LESS THAN THE FULL PRICE FOR THE HILLS
SO YOU END UP PAYING PROPERTY TAXES ON WHAT THEY VALUE OF THE HOUSE THAT I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE THE HOUSE THAT YOU'D PROBABLY ABOUT
OH NINE YEAR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
WHEREAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS AND THOSE THAT THEY PUT THE TAX BASIS THAT HAD ALMOST THE UH FULL PRICE
AND SO THAT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENCE THERE
UM  I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY THEY LEVY TAXES IS A LITTLE BIT UH UH
CRAZY I THINK IT IS THE UH PEOPLE AND AND AND I USE PLANO AS AN EXAMPLE UM HOUSE PRICES IN PLANO WE'RE FALLING
AND SO THEY DECIDED WELL AND WERE TO GET IN MORE TAX REVENUE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE UH YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE THE UH THE THE UH TAX PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF VALUE MY HOUSE
AND SAME TIME THEY WERE APPROVING NEWS STARTS IN HOMES HAND OVER FAST WHEN YOU START HAVING A LARGE SUPPLY UP HOMES
AND THEN OF COURSE THE PRICE GOES YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE IS GOING TO FALL IN THE EXISTING FAMILY HOMES FOR THE ONES THAT WERE FALLING THE NEW HOMES THERE WERE BUILDING CHEAPER AND AN ABLE TO SELL CHEAPER AND SO PEOPLE WEREN'T BUYING THE EXISTING FAMILY UM SO
THEY WERE SHOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FALL
AND YOU KNOW IF THEY JUST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD SHE IF WE DON'T YOU KNOW IF WE PUT A FREEZE SOME NEW HOME STARTS
THAT WILL BRING THE PRICES HOUSES BACK UP OUR TAX BASE REVENUE WILL GO UP AND WE WON'T HAVE TO INCREASE TAXES AND MAKE IT MORE FOR BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING HERE
NO NO THEY DO HAVE STATE INCOME TAX
YES THAT'S AND THEY UH THEY DIVIDED UP BY UM YOU KNOW YOU PAY A STATE INCOME TAX IN IN FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR STATE INCOME TAX IS THE COUNTY TAX WHICH IS COLLECTED BY THE STATE AND REDISTRIBUTED TO THE KENNEDYS
THAT'S CORRECT
UM YES I DID I ONLY LIVED IN TEXAS AND HE SAID AND THEN UH AN EIGHTY EIGHT AND UH PART OF AT NIGHT
NO
UM
IN TEXAS I WAS SO LENIENT SALES TAXES SOMEWHERE AROUND SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT PERCENT
HERE IN MARYLAND IT'S ONLY ON UM IT WAS NICE TO HAVE THAT UM YOU KNOW DEDUCTION WHEN IT WAS AVAILABLE
UM BUT WHEN THEY REVAMPED THE UH YOU KNOW SUPPOSEDLY MAKING THINGS MORE FAIR UM
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS UH PRO IN CON- ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD ALLOW DEDUCTIONS FOR SALES TAX OR EVEN UH
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT MORE EMPHASIS OR THE SALES TAX BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT PURCHASE MORE ITEMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO PAY THE TAXES
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THEIR AT THEIR BARELY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UH HOUSE PAYMENT AND BUY FOOD ARE GONNA BE UH BUYING YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE
AND THE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW HAVE THE UH THE SUPPOSEDLY INCOME THAT OR
PROBABLY MORE ABLE TO PAY THE INCOME TAX
OUR PAY THE SALES TAX ARE THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY YOU KNOW HAVE THE MONEY AND THEY'RE OUT THERE BUYING THE ITEMS MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW PAYING MORE OF A BIRD UM
THERE WAS A THERE'S A ANOTHER CRAZY THING THAT GETS ME IT'S LIKE THE MORE CHILDREN YET HAVE THE LESS TAX YOU PAY
AND TO ME THAT IT'S COMPLETELY CRAZY I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN SO YOU KNOW I YEAH I YOU KNOW IT IT'S KIND OF ODD WHEN I DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS WITH OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME YOU'RE GETTING MORE SERVICES
YOU KNOW YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT FIVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AND SO THE SOMEBODY ONLY HAS WONDER NINE AND SO YOU AND THEY'RE PAYING MORE INCOME TAX TO PAY FOR YOUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL AND JUST YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
UM-HUM
YEAH NOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT ARE WE GETTING WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR UM
FOR THE MOST PART I THINK WE ARE BUT THERE IS A LOT OF INEFFICIENCY UM BOTH FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN ON THE STATE
AND UH HOPEFULLY WE'LL
YOU KNOW AS WE START TO GO INTO COMPUTER UH STATION OF ALL THE PROCESS IS MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO STREAMLINING
UM I HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH UH THE TEXAS POLITICS OTHER THAN THAT THIRTY BELOW GOVERNOR FIGHT
BUT I MEAN UH WE HAVE A A GOVERNOR HERE IN MARYLAND AND SO PRETTY HARD THIS AND THAT HE'S YOU KNOW WE'RE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SHORT
AND EVERY TIME HE COMES UP WITH THE PLAN TO CUT THE MONEY EVERYBODY STARTS SCREAMING AND YOU KNOW
AND UH EVERY TIME HE WANTS TO CUT ONE BUDGET OR DO SOMETHING ELSE TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW THEY START SCREAM YOU KNOW THEY WON'T LET THEM RAISE THE TAXES AND AND THE THE LEADING CUT ANY PROGRAMS AND HE'S LIKE WELL WE GUYS WANT ME TO DO
UM-HUM
YES
YEAH
YEAH THAT AND I THINK UH PUTTING MORE EMPHASIS ON LOCAL HANDLING OF THE PROBLEM I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT BUSH CAME OUT AND SAID AND HIS UH HIS UH DRESS UH TO THE NATION GETTING THE YEAR
UM YOU KNOW IT USED TO DO THAT COMMUNITIES WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE RIGHT
AND THAT YOU KNOW THE STATES WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITIES AND THEN ALL THIS AND EVERYBODY START LOOKING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
AND UH YOU KNOW ONCE YOU START UP AT THE TOP AND TRY TO GET THOSE DOLLARS ON DOWN TO THE HANDS OF NEED THEM YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES THE MONEY STUMPS AND DISAPPEARS ALONG THE WAY
AND UH MAINTENANCE AND OVERHEAD AND YOU KNOW AND THOSE KIND OF CALLS
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HI HOW YOU DOING
DO YOU DO HAVE UH DRUG TESTING WE- YOU W-
UH-HUH
OH YEAH I HAVE UM UH WHAT I'VE FOUND LUCKED OUT OF CURIOSITY WAS MY NAME IS UH THAT'S COME UP TWICE AND WE'VE ONLY BEEN OF ALL THE PROGRAMS THERE ABOUT A YEAR
AND UH WHEN I WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT I WAS VERY UH VERY DEFENSIVES I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT THE COMPANIES OR TO BE DOING UH
UH BECAUSE I FELT THAT I WAS LOSING SOMETHING UP TAKING SOMETHING AWAY FROM IT
YEAH BUT NOW UH NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING UH AT
I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT I UH I DON'T FEEL SO I'VE LOST ANYTHING AND THAT I FEEL LAWS SECURE IN THAT I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY THAT WORKS
AROUND ME UM
IS IS DRUG FREE
AND HOW ABOUT HOW BOTH FOR YOU
UM-HUM
WELL I WAS INVOLVED IN UH IN THE IN IN THE INITIAL TRAINING PROGRAM BECAUSE I HAD TO GROW A TEACHER EXPLAIN TO OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT WE WERE DOING WHY WE'RE DOING IT SO I I GUESS THEY HAD A LITTLE UH UH FIRST AND KNOWLEDGE OF
OF UH SAYING THE FILMS I HAD MORE EXPENSIVE TRAINING AND AND UH BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE REASONS WHY THEY WERE DOING AND OF COURSE THAT THE
UH THAT WE PROJECTED THAT IT'S THAT ACTUALLY COST COMPANIES BY HAVING PEOPLE UP UH BE INVOLVED WITH DRUGS
OH YEAH
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ALL THE ALL THE RAW THINGS LIKE PUBLIC UH SAFETY BOSSES BUS DRIVERS AND AND UH AIRPLANE DRIVERS OR
PILOTS RATHER
YOU
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I
UM-HUM
YEAH THE THE UH UM I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT P- PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED WITH THE SAFETY OF OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE DRUG TESTED HAVE I'VE NEVER SAID THAT HE DIDN'T WANT THAT THE PROBLEM BUT I HAD WAS
WHETHER MICHAEL WORKERS ON DRUGS THEN THAT HAS DOES NOT HAVING INFLUENCE ON MY SAFE WELL-BEING
AND UM SO I HAD UH
RIGHT
WELL I'M SURE THAT'S STILL GONNA HAPPEN
UM BUT I'VE GONE TO THOSE CLASSES UH WHAT WHAT CHEVROLET FOR ME I I'M A SMALL CAUGHT AND UM I I STILL THE STATISTICS THAT CAME OUT ON
UM SMOKERS TYPICALLY HAVE MORE TIME I DON'T WORK THERE WERE A LOT MORE PRONE ACCIDENTS AND ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS AND AND UH
FOR FOUR MOBILIZE TURNS I HAD NO IDEA
BUT THEY WERE DOING IT I KNOW THAT THEY'RE ORIGINALLY TALKING ABOUT THE HEALTH
UH-HUH
YOU KNOW IS ATTENTIVE
UM-HUM
AND THAT'S UH THAT'S DIFFERENT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT HOW ABOUT THE UH UM
THE THESE SMOKING PREMIUMS
UH IN TEXAS THEY JUST AND AND IT STARTED DOING THAT
JUNE JULY
YEAH AND AND THEY FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT UH NO THIS IS ONE UP ALL THE SIGHTS
YEAH
WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS YOU DON'T UH HOW BOTH UH YOU WOULD YOU LIKE FRENCH FRIES
WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WHAT DID YOU EVER SAY IF THEY SAID ANYBODY WEE'S FRENCH FRIES THAT'S A PET THAT WAS A PREMIUM WHEN THE LIFE INSURANCE
UH THEN YOU WOULD GET UPSET IT'S IT'S UH WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS IN DOUBLING UP THEY POPULATION PEAS BY PIECE
AND UH AND ALL THEY KNOW THAT THEY NUMBER A PERCENTAGE OR SMOKERS IS UH IS LESS THAN THE THE UH THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE AND IT DIDN'T DO THAT UM
PREVENTABLE THAT'S NOT YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT ISN'T ISN'T THE UH THE INSURANCE ALSO FULL FULL RUBBLE QUES-
SO THEY'RE NOT ONLY SAYING PICKING UP PREVENTABLE THAT THEY'RE ALSO SAYING UM
THAT YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE LESS LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SICK IF YOU DON'T SMOKE
UH-HUH
IS YOU KNOW THE PERSON
WELL THAT
THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE
YEAH ANY DAY DOES MISS A LOT OF WORK
YEAH
YEAH
WELL
WE WE DO ME IF THEY COULD PROVE IT DID THIS OR DO YOU
I THINK IN A IN A RAISE IT'S IT'S UH I'M SURE IT IS UH THOUGH HAS HIGH CHOLESTEROL
TO SEE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE TEAR MAN WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT IS NOT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVE THAT IT IS ON HEALTHY BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE FRENCH FRIES AND I TELL PEOPLE YEAH IT'S IT'S JUST THE CAPABILITY UH BE TAXING IT
HOW DO YOU PROVE SOMEONE HAS EATEN FRENCH FRIES
UM BUT I THINK IN TIME COMES YOU'VE BEEN TO SEE THAT HAPPENING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE UM WITH THE HIGH RICH PEOPLE PAY A PREMIUM BUT THEY HAVE A MINUTE WAIT APPROVE IT
YEAH YEAH
UH W-
OH YEAH BUT THEY WERE MORE DRINKERS THAN SMALL BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
AND AND DRINKING IS STILL SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE WHERE SMOKING IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE DANGER THAT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE TO THE SO THE REALLY CAN'T MAKE A CHANGE IN IN POLICY ABOUT DRINKING UNTIL
YEAH YEAH RIGHT RIGHT YEAH
SO I GUESS YOU CAN YOU CAN CLASSIFY ALCOHOL IS THE DRUGS I WAS A CIGARETTE MY OPINION UM WHERE IT'S NOT SO I DON'T THINK PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE SMOKING ARE DOING IT VOLUNTARILY I THINK THEY'RE DOING IT INVOLVES ONLY
I KNOW I AM UH I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THAT SAYS THAT THAT I'M DOING IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FIND
WELL I'D I D- I DO THAT I DO MAKE THAT STATEMENT I SAY DO IT BECAUSE I LIKE IT BUT I CAN'T SAY I'M I'M I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO I'M DOING BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BARBECUE AT MY DESIRES GREATER THAN UH
UH-HUH
IT'S NOT UP AGAIN

BUT UH BUT
YEAH I STILL STILL ABLE TO SURVIVE AND
AND UH UH WORKING FOR A COMPANY THAT REAP SOME BENEFITS FROM THE TAX MONEY IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE PAYING YOUR OWN SALARY I DON'T WORK DIRECTLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT UH IT GETTING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND
BEING IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY AS IT WERE YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE SLIM THESE DAYS IT'S STILL UH
STILL THE FEELING OF YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TOTALLY WASTED DOLLARS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SO THAT COMING BACK YOUR WAY
UH THAT HELPS THE RATIONALE ANY BUT IT'S IT'S STILL A GREEN TO SEE THE ABUSES UH EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE UH
A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE THEY STILL IT SOUNDS HUMONGOUS WHEN THEY'RE YOU KNOW YOUR MILLIONS AND SOMETIMES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT THEN
AND EVEN SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OVER THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT AREA IT IT'S REAL PRETTY SMALL CHILD CONSIDERING WHAT ACTUALLY FLOWS THROUGH THAT GOVERNMENT
SO WHAT THOSE OTHER THINGS THEY JUST GOING ARE GONNA START UP SOMETIMES
YEAH
DESIRE THAT THAT MONEY NOT USE THAT ALTHOUGH
NO NO TEXAS DOESN'T HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX YET THAT'S
WELL A LOT OF TIME THE CITY GETS INVOLVED I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEIR HAND IN IT BUT WE PAY EIGHT AND A QUARTER SO
SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY PRETTY MUCH SO I THINK IT DOES IT UP PRETTY MUCH TO UH THE COUNTY GET SOME OF THE CITY GETS SOME IN THE STATE GETS UM
AND IT'S IT'S QUITE A BIT I THINK SIX SOMETHING IS THE STATE AND AND UH THE REST OF THE PIE GOES ELSEWHERE
BUT WE'RE IN A BIGGER PART OF STATE THAT'S PRETTY WELL ALSO UH IT IT'S LIKE WE GET A LOT OF THAT BACK AS FAR AS LOCAL TAXATION GOES
HAVE A REAL GOOD YOU KNOW POLICE DEPARTMENT IN REAL GOOD UH CITY SERVICES AND BOY THE PARKS OR ALL OVER THE PLACE AND A LOT OF
LOST MONEY SPENT ON US BUT UH THE POOR ROLE FOLKS UH BARELY CAN GET A LAWN SERVICE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO IT'S
THE REAL MIXED LET'S SEE I GUESS UH
DAD YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD FIND SOMEONE
OH
THIS LOOSE TO BUY A A GROUP AND AN HONEST ENOUGH TO FIND A WAY THAT WE GO OVER AND THEN YOU GOT TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK
YEAH YEAH
THE UH BUREAUCRACY SEEMS TO SPEND
MORE MONEY JUST TRYING TO ADMINISTER SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE PROGRAMS ARE WORTH UH IT SEEMS SO UH
AN AWFUL WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE I MEAN IT'S A LOT SO MUCH PAPER JUST TO GET RID OF SO FEW DOLLARS AND SOME OF THESE CASES
SO I MEAN
YEAH
AND SO WHAT THAT RED TAPE WAS WAS INITIALLY AND AND IT AT ALL AND
TWO TRY AND STOP A GIVEN ABUSE OR YOU JUST COVER A PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT WELL A LOT TO RUN THE SEX CHECKING LOTS OF UH FOLLEY'S EXTRA PAPERS TO SAY WELL YOU DESERVE THIS WELFARE OR WHATEVER
AND THEY JUST KEEP TRYING TO S- TO
CHLOROFLUO- LOOPHOLES AND STOP YOU USE IT ALL THEY'RE DOING IS MAKING IT WORSE AND HAVEN'T HAD MORE STAFF AND
AND UH DECREASING YOU FISH AND SEE OF THOSE WHO WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO STOP IT IT'S
UM-HUM
RIGHT
IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S WORTH UH IN THE ECONOMY'S GOING PRETTY WELL FOR UH
HUNDRED YEARS OR SO AND IT WITH THE GOVERNMENT DOING WHAT THEY DO WITH TAXES STEERING INVESTMENTS AND STEERING VIRTUALLY EVERY
DOLLAR YOU MAKE OR SPEND IT GETS UH
STEERED ONE WHERE THE OTHER BASED ON TAX BREAKS YOU GET IT AND YOU KNOW HOUSING HAD TAX BREAKS FOR A WHILE AND AND IT'S LIKE OFF ON THAT FOR A WHILE AND THEN
JUST UH THE SURELY WANTING TO BE IN CONTROL OF UH WHERE EVERYTHING'S GOING FOR THE MOST PART DO THE BEST BREAK IF YOU GO THERE DIRECTION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE
UH GOT RID OF SOME OF THOSE CONTROLS AND JUST WITH THIS WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY WOULD BE SIMPLER OF JUST HAVING UH YOU SPEND THIS MUCH
UH THEREFORE YOU COULD BE TAXED THIS MUCH UH THAT WAS ONLY HEARD SAVINGS IT'S NOT A UH
YOU KNOW MOST TAX YOUR INCOME BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REPORT AT ALL I KIND OF STUFF
BUT IF YOU PUT THE BURDEN ON
THE RETAILER WHO REALLY DON'T CARE IF YOU KNOW F- BROKERS ALIKE YOU FIGURE WHO BOUGHT THE GROCERIES REPAIR THE TAX ON IT
SO UH WE'RE MOST PEOPLE TEND TO SPEND WHAT THEY MAKE ANY WAY AND AND OUR AND INCOME BRACKETS
SO YOU ALL THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR WE
PRETTY MUCH BEEN THE MAJORITY OF IT AND WHAT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT WOULDN'T <UNK> AEROBIC IT'S COULD SAY THEY WOULDN'T GET TAXED ON
YEAH BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE A LIST YOUR PEOPLE FORD
A PARTICULAR TYPE OF SAVINGS YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAY WELL YOU GET BETTER TAX BONDS IS YOU KNOW
OF WOULD BECOME GAINS TAX AND YOU DO IT THIS WAY DO THIS AND YOU ROLL OVER YOUR IRAS AND ALL THAT THEY
IT WOULDN'T BE A LIST YOUR PEOPLE TOWARD RETIREMENT AND ALL THAT BUT BOY IF YOU SAY THAT MUCH MONEY
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TAXATION PROBLEM WHEN YOU MIGHT
WELL I DO ALL RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHO
YEAH
THAT'S FOR SURE
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S WHAT WHAT THERE WILL BE OF IT EVEN IF IT'S THERE ISN'T QUITE ENOUGH ANYWAY SO
YOU'RE LOOKING HAVING TO DO IN YOUR OWN FOR THE MOST PART THAT HOLDS WHICH DID DIDN'T GO AWAY
YEAH THE UH
THE TAXES THERE OR
KIND OF MESSED UP I GUESS WITH THE ABUSES AND THE THINGS WE RIDDEN INTO IT BUT UH LOOKING LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO WE OTHER OPTIONS YOU HAVE IN THE WORLD OR
NOT ALL THAT PLEASANT ANYWHERE
YEAH PRETTY MUCH
WELL I HEAR ONE OF MY KIDDOS DOING SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T BE SO ALL UH I LIKE TO GO AND THEY
YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT EACH OTHER AGAIN
I'LL TRY BYE
I THINK I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS CONVINCED THAT WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH IN TAXES
WITHOUT GETTING BACK NECESSARILY EVERYTHING WE'D LIKE TO BUT SO FAR
I DON'T THINK I PAID ENOUGH TAXES TO BE TOO TOO AWFULLY CONCERNED ABOUT YET
YES
RIGHT
RIGHT
DO YOU OKAY STATE INCOME TAX
I MEAN THEY DO WE AND AND AND I AGREE WITH THE YET PART THEY'VE JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT INTRODUCING A STATE INCOME TAX
AND RIGHT NOW WE PAY AN EXTREMELY HIGH STATE UH SALES TAX ALMOST EIGHT PERCENT
WOW
RIGHT
WELL THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE TAX SYSTEM IS THAT THERE IS SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN BETWEEN REALLY THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS
AND I I THINK THEY THINGS THAT THEY USE AS A BASIS FOR DISTRIBUTING BACK THE TAX DOLLARS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN
I KNOW THAT WOULD BE UH I'D DEFINITE BVR MIR
I THINK A LOT A LOT OF TIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THE CLASSIC CAN'T SEE THE FORCE FOR THE TREES I- I WONDER IF IF THEY REALIZE
THE THE MAGNITUDE OF SOME OF THE RED TAPE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GETTING THEIR MONEY'S WORTH AND I'D I'D DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THAT THAT ADDED
STEPS ARE ARE UP GETTING THE BENEFIT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BUT I THINK IT'S JUST CAUSING MOST EVERYONE ELSE MORE PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET AROUND THE TAX LAWS
THEY WILL FIND A WAY
IF THEY WANT TOO BADLY ENOUGH THEY'LL EVEN FIND IT THEMSELVES OR THEY'LL FIND SOMEONE TO DO IT FOR THEM
RIGHT
RIGHT
AND THAT MAKES SENSE BUT LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN IT'S IT SEEMS SIMPLE AND I THINK IN A WAY IT'S SO SIMPLE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE AFRAID TO TRY IT
YEAH
YEAH EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T INVEST IN NECESSARILY THE THE BEST THING YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO INVEST
YOU STILL BE AHEAD
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING I NEEDED TO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT IS IS THAT
UNDER THE CARD STRUCTURAL WHAT IS THE BEST THING TO BE INVESTING IN FOR THE FUTURE
BECAUSE THAT'S A THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS HEAR THAT THOSE THE SECURITY WON'T BE AROUND BY THE TIME
WHERE SIXTY THREE OR SIXTY FIVE AND AND BEAT IT AND THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT
NO
WE STILL A PRETTY GOOD FAMILY

ROCK AND ROLL KIND OF THING
ALTHOUGH NOW I KIND OF ENJOY SHARING THE ROCK AND ROLL I GUESS IT MAKES ME THINK I'M YOUNG AGAIN
IS THAT THE TRUE IT'S FUNNY IN FACT IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT SO MANY OF THE SONGS AND I GREW UP
IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES AND SO MUCH OF THE MUSIC THAT WAS POPULAR AT THAT TIME HAS COME BACK
AND YOU YOU DON'T HEAR EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE MUCH AT THE SAME MUSIC PERHAPS THE NEW VERSION OF IT BUT IT'S THE SAME STUFF

RIGHT RIGHT IN THE NEWS
UH-HUH
YES THAT THE- THERE'S SOME WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN MUSIC WHEN YOU CAN FIND THAT STATION UH THE PROBLEM THAT I FOUND UM IN THIS AREA IS THAT THE
THEY DO IS INCONSISTENCY IN THE QUALITY
HERE IF YOU GET SOMEONE WHO'S VERY GOOD IS SELECTING IT'S OKAY BUT SOMETIMES THEY KIND OF GET ON UH UH THE ENGINE THEY THEY PLAY THE SAME SORT OF THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITHOUT REALLY NECESSARILY QUALITY

I DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT
HM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WELL UP IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE I'M FROM UP IF YOU HAD TO GET UP AND THEN BEFORE YOU COULD BUY ANY ANY AND AMMUNITION
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD I THINK IT THEY UH TAKES TWO WEEKS FOR THAT SYSTEM TOO PRICES UM YOU REQUEST FOR UH
NOT AS A GUN COMMIT BUT BUT TO BUY AMMUNITION KEPT GET A PERMIT FROM THE POLICE STATION IN YOUR LOCAL AREA TO DO THAT
YEAH UM
I- I- I AGREE I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS STUFF TO
TO STOP THE IMPULSE BUY A FORM OF BUYING IT QUICKLY AND AND UH MAYBE PUTTING A WEEK'S WAITING PERIOD IS SOMETHING UP OF SOMEONE'S REALLY DETERMINED TO TO PICK UP A FLY ON UH YOU CAN PICK UP ON A PLACE AND IT GOT SOME REALLY CHEAP
UH
HOW LONG WAS A WAITING PERIOD THAT
UH I WASN'T TOO TOO BAD
BECAUSE IT IF YOU'RE GONNA GO BUY SOMETHING UM OF THAT NATURE I THINK YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME IDEA AS TO WHICH GOING TO DO WITH YOU AND I KIND OF REACT THAT QUICKLY ANOTHER WHICH I DON'T HAVE A NEED TO GO BUY A GUN TO GO SHOOT AT THE NEXT DAY
YEAH I DO TOO UM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE UH OF WHETHER IT'S A PISTOL SHOTGUN I SUPPOSE THEY BOTH DO THE SAME KIND OF JOB
UM YEAH I SUPPOSE I NEVER GOT SHOT WOULD BE THE ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW UH BUT I THINK YOU COULD RECOVER FROM A PISTOL BUT NOT FROM A SHOTGUN
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH
UH  I'VE GOT UH MANUALS SINGLE SHOT NOW I GUESS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ANY AUTOMATIC FEATURES DO WITH THE FOR THE WAY I GET THE THE UH WHY THE SHOT GETS FROM SO I GET
AND THE CLOSE TO THAT I GOT THE IDEA THAT IT GETS
BUT I LIKE TO DO IT
DO YOU BELONG TO A GUN CLUB OR YOU UH
UM-HUM
NO KIDDING
UH-HUH WELL THE THE UH THE CLUBS THAT WE'VE GOT AROUND HERE KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT THOSE IT'S WELL WORTH IT YOU CAN GET DOWN HERE TO BEGIN TO SEND BIG SO TARGETS AND HAVE UH COMPETITION
UM I'VE NEVER REALLY JOIN THE CLUB BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT THE TYING UP BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T DECI- UH THERE'S AN ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE
UH THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY HIGH PLUSES INITI- INITIATION FI- THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY HIS FIRST TIME UH UM I'M BA-
SO THE WHOLE PROCESS CAN CRUSHER HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO JOIN THE CLUB BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THE AMMUNITION AND TOURNAMENTS THAT YOU WOULD TRY AND AND
UH-HUH
I THINK THE THE GUN CLUBS SHOULD BE USEFUL PURPOSE IN FACT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME HA- THEY TIED THE LEGISLATION INTO NOT ONLY WHEN YOU BUY A WEAPON YOU HAVE TO UH SHOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL GOING TO SOME CLASS TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE WEAPON
AND NO IT IT EVEN THAT YOU WOULD GET NINE DAYS IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE A PUTTING SOMEONE IN AN AUTOMOBILE THAT DOES NOT A DRIVING TO GIVE MY WIFE IS BECAUSE YOU WE DID NOT AND IT'S
YOU COULD YOU COULD NOT ONLY UH RUSSIA ITSELF YOU COULD YOU COULD UH MISHANDLE WEAPON LEAVE IT AT HOME ANOTHER CHILD GOOD AT IT
WATER WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU COULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
WOW
I BOUGHT SOME PRIVATE CITIZENS SELLING UH WEAPONS LIKE IF YOU WANT TO SO YOU'RE A PISTOL TO MAKE
UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT DO BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE LEGISLATION BITING THE UH BUY INTO SOLOMON OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SELL YOU A SYSTEM UM BECAUSE YOU WANT IT
YEAH IT IS ISN'T THEIR WAY TO UH TO DO YOU READ USUALLY ITSELF UP YOU REGISTERED GUN
BECAUSE I S-
YEAH
YEAH AS A REGISTERED
THE UH THE RIFLE THAT I'VE GOT IS NOT REGISTERED AND UH I DON'T KNOW I NEVER ROGERS IT BUT THE UH
UM I- I THINK IT'S IT'S VOLUNTARY OF THE UH THE
YEAH
YEAH I GUESS THAT COULD HAPPEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE UH THE SOURCE SECURITY SYSTEM ONCE THEY UH THEY GAVE EVERYBODY A NUMBER NOW THEY'RE MAKING YOU UM UH GOT ONE THAT THAT WE'RE
AND ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR NUMBER THEY HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR IDENTIFICATION AND IF YOU TRY TO DO ANYTHING UH LIKE UH NOT IDENTIFIED IS UP TO THE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW WE ROCK
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UH UH GOOD WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE
THEY PROBABLY DO
YEAH
UH-HUH
YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT PICKING UP BY GUNS THAT THAT ARE NOT REGISTERED
NO I DON'T I- I CAN I CAN BUY SOME UH PREP I WANTED TO JUST YOU KNOW PUT UP SOME MONEY
UH-HUH
YEAH
AND THERE'S THERE'S NO WAITING PERIOD ON THAT
AND SO THE PRINTER THERE

UH CONTROL I- I DON'T BELIEVE IN UM SESSION PROBABLY SAY CONTROLLING REGULATIONS CONTROLS IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HAVE UM WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM HAVE I'M ON A DRAIN CAPABILITY
SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO HAS WHAT WEAPONS

WELL THAT KIND OF KIND OF I'M SURPRISED IT'S KIN- I THINK THAT THEY'VE CHANGED DRASTICALLY I MEAN I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MY MOTHER WHO
YOU KNOW GAVE UP THEIR CAREERS AND STAYED HOME TO RAISE KIDS AND UM
YEAH I PLAYED A REALLY SUBSERVIENT ROLE IN THE FAMILY AND I JUST DON'T SEE THAT ANY MORE OFTEN
EVEN WOMEN WHO DO STAY HOME TRACE FAMILIES I THINK THAT THEY'RE STILL A LOT OF AS EQUALS IN IN THE YOU KNOW AS AS FAR AS THEIR OWN FAMILY IN SOCIETY UH UM
UM-HUM
HM
YEAH
DEFINITELY
I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM SPRINT THE BIGGEST CHANGE IT NEEDS TO BE MADE IS THE WAY THAT WOMEN ARE PAYING IN
UH YEAH IT'S JUST THE STATISTICS ARE JUST STAGGERING YEAH THAT ONE AND MAKE LIKE YEAH SIXTY CENTS ON A DOLLAR FOR WHAT MENU FOR THE SAME JOB THAT I MEAN I CAN GET
YEAH
WELL
THAT'S TRUE
THAT YOU KNOW I'M A SINGLE PARENT TRYING TO RAISE THE CHILD AND IT REALLY UPSETS ME NOT TO BE PAID YOU KNOW THE SAME FOR MY JOB NOW I DON'T SEE THAT'S SO MUCH IN MY JOB THAT I KNOW IN OTHER PROFESSIONS
UM I KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE I KNOW YOU HAVE FRIENDS OF MINE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY NOW
AND UM JUST YOU KNOW IT'S JUST NOT
OH WHAT TO DO THAT
YEAH YEAH
AND THEN SHE I THINK THAT
YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN HAVE TEN FORCED INTO THE WORK PLACE AND WAITING LINE JUST BECAUSE THE ENGINE TO RAISE A FAMILY NINA DAYS IT IT TAKES TWO INCOMES
THEY HAVE TO WORK AND THEN I THINK IN THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THEY CAN STILL GET STUCK WITH MOST OF THE YOU KNOW RUNNING THE HOUSE TYPE CHORES
YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS AND YOU KNOW ARRANGING THEIR SCHEDULES AND
BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE TYPE THINGS I KNOW THAT I DO MISS THEM IN THAT THAT PARTICIPATE QUITE ACTIVELY UM YOU KNOW AND AND THINGS BUT I KNOW A LOT THAT DON'T SO
IT'S JUST A REAL SHAME YOU UH I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHANGING ROLES WHEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CHANGING ALL AT THE END TOO BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY RELATED AND
YEAH
WELL MAY- MAY- YEAH I THINK EVENTUALLY THAT SOME MEN DON'T SEE SOME IN JUST DON'T CARE
YEAH
YEAH I- I AGREE THAT YEAH

BUT UM I GUESS HO- INTERESTINGLY  THE POLICE NO NO NO IT'S IT'S GOOD TO FORTY AND
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT THAT THERE'S MORE <UNK> YEAH THERE'S DEFINITELY ARE MORE WOMEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE  UM I THINK IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT UH UM I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS I DO-
I THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN  EX- TWENTY YEARS BUT IT'S UM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S PROGRESS
AND I'M NOT SURE POLITICAL SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW ANY STATISTICS ON YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN RUN FOR PUBLIC OFF THE AND HOW OFTEN IT DEFEATED
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A A BLACK A BLACK MAN HAS PRESIDENT BEFORE WE SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT
UM-HUM
SAME TYPE OF BASIL UM-HUM

YEAH BEING ALONE AND I DON'T KNOW AND EVEN THEN I WOULD VOTE
WELL ONE AND IN THE HIGH ON THE
I CERTAINLY I WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR  IN UH I CAN'T SAY THAT I WOULD GO FROM WHEN PRESIDENT NOW
WELL I SEE A WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AND THEN OF COURSE IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO BE ON A YOU KNOW AND IT'S SOME HAPPEN YOU SHE WOULD BE PRESIDENT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE IT TOO
UM-HUM
IS THAT RIGHT
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT  OUR GROUP THAT SURE WHAT SHE FELL SHE WAS I THOUGHT SHE WAS REAL WELL WE IT REAL WELL RESPECTED
UM-HUM
OH YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL HOW DO YOU THINK WOMEN'S ROLES HAVE CHANGED
UM-HUM UM-HUM UM-HUM
WELL I- I HAD JUST IN MY LIFETIME I KNOW THAT THE ROLE OF WOMEN CHANGE DRASTICALLY ALSO MY MOTHER WHEN SHE BEGAN HAD HER FAMILY SHE QUIT THEIR JOB AND STAYED HOME UNTIL
I'M YOUNGEST IN MY FAMILY UNTIL I WAS UH IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL OLD ENOUGH TO CARE FOR MYSELF WHEN I GOT HOME FIRST FROM SCHOOL
BUT I THINK THAT UH THE THE CHANGES IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WILL PROBABLY BE JUST AS DRASTIC YOU GO SEE MORE WOMEN CEOS AND AND MORE AND MORE WOMEN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE IS
OH I AGREE
AND UM
IT'S IT'S PROBABLY ALL IT IT'S
THE ROLE OF WOMEN IS IS IN IN EVOLUTIONARY DAYS SO I- I'M SURE IT'LL EVENTUALLY OF OFF TO WHERE IT'S EQUAL IT JUST HASN'T REACHED THAT POINT YET BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE IT
I'VE BEEN IN POSITIONS SIMILAR TO MEN FORD THAT MANY YEARS RELATIVE TO HOW LONG MEN HAVE HAS THOSE TYPE POSITION
NO IT'S FANS
WELL THERE'S NOT MUCH CANDY EXCEPT FOR YOURSELF INDIVIDUALLY AND AND YOU KNOW SO
YOUR SALARY SO WHAT ONE IN YOUR JOB IF IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT SO I'D LIKE IT WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK A DETERRENT IN THIS EVOLUTIONARY EERIE THAT I HAVE HERE THAT MEN WILL EVENTUALLY
EV- ALL AROUND TO WHERE THEY PURCHASE TAKE MORE IN THE HOME BECAUSE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE THAT THE HOUSE AND THIRTY IN THE KIDS ARE THIRTY AND THEN MOM NOT HOME SHE'S AT WORK MANNER GONNA GRADUALLY LEARN HOW TO DO THIS KIND OF THING
WELL AND I'VE BEEN THE GENERATIONS THEY'RE BEING RAISED NOW BY WORKING MOTHERS YEAH I I'M ARE A LITTLE MORE IN TOUCH WITH
THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES AND DUTY SOMEONE HAS TO BE DONE LIKE THING OVER A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS TIME IT'LL CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BEEN UM MY GENERATION I'M TWENTY FIVE AND AND MY GENERATION
GREW UP FOR THE MOST PART WITH M- IN THE HOME BUT I GET MY GENERATION PLANS OF WOMEN PLANT ALL WORKING AND NOT BEING AT HOME
THAT WILL BE MY CHILDREN TO REALLY MAKE BIG CHANGES I THINK BECAUSE THAT THEY'LL PROBABLY THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN
NOW ARE AT HOME WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER OR WELL OR OR IN SOME TYPE OF THE DAY CARE OR SOMETHING BECAUSE SO MANY WOMEN WORK NOW
UM-HUM
YES
UM-HUM
SO WITH HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT WOMEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE YOU THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO GROW IN IN A HOUSE PARTY THINK THAT'S GOING TO GO IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO
UH-HUH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW ANY STATISTICS EAT IT BUT IT'S IT'S PROBABLY GET AT THE SAME TYPE OF SITUATION THAT THAT UH THE BLACK PEOPLE I'VE GONE THROUGH A A TOOK THEM
AS WELL BLACK MEN A LONG TIME TO TO GET IT TO THE PAY SCALES OF THE WHITE MEN AND NOW I THINK IT'S IT'S FEASIBLE FOR BLACK MEAN PRESIDENT

TYPE OF DEAL IS JUST FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

I'D I'D HAVE TO SAY I HAVE A BROTHER

OH I'M NOT SURE TRUE CALL THE BECOME THE THE SMALL ALL COMPETING INDEPENDENT SORT OF NEWSPAPERS REAL SMALL WEEKLY THINGS WHICH IS ONLY ONE DAY A WEEK OF CALL THE NEWS IN OBSERVER FONDLY REFERRED TO YOU'RE BY SOME AS THE UH A-
SOMETIMES THE NOISE AND OBSERVER A- DEPENDS IT'S IT'S IT HAS DECENT NATIONAL COVERAGE BUT HAS AN EXTREMELY
FOCUSED POLITICAL COVERAGE PROBABLY STEEPED IN THE SOUTHERN HISTORY OF THE FACT THAT THAT THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC STATE AND SO CONSEQUENTLY AND EVERYTHING IT'S FILTERED THROUGH THAT WHOLE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATIC SORT OF
THE LAST UH ALMOST ONE NECESSARILY FOUGHT SO
YEAH WE WE HAVE THAT AS A AS A MATTER OF FACT THE UPDATED ONCE A WEEK WITH A SPECIAL SECTION AND AND WE PAY IT SORT OF GLANCING NOT WE UH HAVE A VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS
A- TAPPED INTO THE CITY PLANNING STRUCTURE A- DEVELOPER ARCHITECT FRIEND AND
RIGHT SO I THINK WE COULD FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CITY OFF FAIRLY FREQUENT BASIS OVER OF OF VIRGIN TONIC SORT OF THING ON AND THAT PROBABLY GIVES A BETTER INSIDE IS TO THE CITY OF RALEIGH THE THE THE PAPER WOULD HAVE ANYWAY

SORT OF HAVE HOUSEHOLD PA- BECAUSE LET'S TURN THE WAR OFF AND AND GET SOMETHING DONE
ALMOST AN EDUCATION A- AND AND WE COULD EQUATE TO RELATE WELL TO SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER AND TELEVISION ARTICLES ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND AND I KNOW HOOKING UNCOUPLING FROM THE EVENTS
AND GOING ON WITH THEIR LIFESTYLE AND SAVING WATCHING THE MUSCLES AND GLUED TO THE TO THE TUBE AND WHATEVER

I THINK THAT'S GREA- BUT THEY ALSO SAID ON THIS UM NEW STORY THAT THAT PEOPLE COULD SELL IT TO ONE ANOTHER
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THE BACKGROUND CHECK AND I MEAN THEY WENT ON TO SAIL ABOUT ALL THE ILLEGAL GUNS AND EVERYTHING IN IT I THINK THAT SIXTY MINUTES BALL SOME GUNS AND UM
LIKE AN UZI EVEN AND
AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND PEOPLE WALK AROUND AGAIN JESUIT THERE BECAUSE OF THEIR BACK FAN FOR- SELL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY BACKGROUND CHECK AND HAVING ANY THEY WOULD SELL IT TO ANYBODY

OH REALLY
YEAH YEAH
WE GO
WELL I THINK UH I THINK UH SCALE OF ONE TO TEN I WOULD BE I WOULD BE MORE TOWARDS A UH A UH UH THE
A STAND IT WOULD NOT TOTALLY HANDGUNS BUT WOULD CERTAINLY VERY MUCH CONTROL UH
YEAH I THINK THE THE
UH IT IT YOU KNOW LIKE I SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M COMING FROM UH I'M COMING FROM MY MY UH UH MY MY MY PARENTS RELATIVES IN MASSACHUSETTS ARE ALL THEY HAVE A GUN OWNERS MY DAD'S GOT A BIG COLLECTION
UH MY BROTHER'S GOT A COLLECTION THERE THEY BULLS WOULD DO POLICE WORK UH THEY GO OUT AND SHOOTING
THEY'RE FROM THE MENTALITY THAT WHEN YOU UH GET THE GUNS ARE AGAINST THE LAW ONLY CRIMINALS <UNK> AND THAT SORT OF THING
BUT I UH I- I- I THINK IT'S FAR TOO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GET GUNS
UH LET ME LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE A LITTLE MORE OF OF MY BACKGROUND CORE OF REALLY COME TO THIS POSITION I I'D IS UP TOLD YOU BEFORE UH WE LIVED IN MALAYSIA FOR FOUR YEARS
AND IT THAT I TELL YOU HOW AGAINST THE LAW GUNS OR ANY KIND OF FIRE ARMS ARE UH IT'S A HANGING THE FENCE
TO HAVE IT DONE IS TWO OFFENSES BETTER HANGING ONE IS TO HAVE A GUN IN THE OTHER IS TO IS TO DEAL IN OUR PRODUCT AND AND THERE'S NO APPEAL ONCE YOU FOUND GUILTY THE SENTENCES AUTOMATIC
OKAY WELL IT'S INTERESTING THEY DO UH WELL THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NOT LIKE WE DO HERE YOU CAN'T BUY OFF THE STREET CARS BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY TO BE MADE IN DRUGS
BUT THERE'S A BLAST MIGHT NOT FOR SELLING IN MALAYSIA IT BUT PEOPLE GO TO THAILAND AND THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM THROUGH THE AIRPORT THERE THE LAST FEW PEOPLE WOULD GO HUNTING OR EVEN TRYING TO SELL THEM THERE THEY WERE JUST UH CAUGHT WITH THEM
AND AND AND THE UH THE LAW SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN QUANTITY ON YOUR PRESUME TO BE A DEALER
IF YOU'RE USER THE PENALTIES A MUCH MUCH LET YOU GO TO REHABILITATE SHOULD IF YOU'RE DEALER HERS THEN YOU GET ON BUT ANYWAY I THINK
THEY HAVE SOME VERY STRONG AND I DON'T WANT THEIR AND AND UH LIKE IT'S A HANGING A FENCE
NOW UH YEAH PEOPLE GET BROKEN INTO WHEN THEY GET SLICED UP WITH KNIVES BUT AT LEAST A PERSON HAS TO BE NEXT TO YOU WOULD AND I MEAN YOU CAN I'LL RUN A NICE BUT YOU CANNOT RUN A GUN
SO UH THE VIOLIN UH THERE IS NOT AS MANY PEOPLE GETTING KILLED IN ROBBERIES AND HOLDUPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU SEE HERE
UH THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I'VE COME TO THAT TO THAT WAY OF THINKING OF COURSE THE UH AS VERY EMOTIONAL UH THINKING OVER WHAT HAPPENED A PRISONER REA- YOU KNOW THE GUY THAT GOT IT WAS MENTALLY TERRAIN SHOULD GET ONE SO WE USUALLY
UH BUT I'M SURE THAT THEY GOT A LOT OF PUBLICITY THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD GET SHOT WITH GUNS BUT YOU COOL WE MENTALLY DUR- HUGE PEOPLE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK IT'S I- I- I THINK IT'S GREAT AND I'M TRYING TO THINK THE UH SECRET SERVICE AGENT THEY GOT A INJURED SO BADLY WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT PRESIDENT REAGAN
BRADY AND THIS IS A LOT IT'S BEFORE THE THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IS IS REFERRED TO WITH THE BRADY LOOK BILL RIGHT
YEAH AND AND THAT REQUIRES SOME THAT WOULD BE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND REQUIRE SOME WAITING PERIODS PRESUMABLY THAT DURING THAT WAITING PERIOD THEY WOULD BE A BACKGROUND UH CHECK THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU KNOW I WONDER I HAD OCCASION TO GOING TO A PAWN SHOP RECENTLY AND I'VE BEEN IN ONE OF MY LIFE BEFORE AND UH I WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND AND AND THE MAJORITY OF WHAT THEY'VE GOTTEN THEIR GUNS
YEAH I'LL BET THEY ARE NOW THAT YOU KNOW I- I- I WOULD IMAGINE LEGITIMATE GUN DEALERS YOU'D HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS BUT I BUT SOMEBODY GOES IN OFFERS A PAWN SHOP
GOT SOME MONEY FOR A GUN
HE HE JUST PICKS IT UP OVER THE COLOR
AND AND I WAS I WAS REALLY SURPRISED AT THAT YOU CAN GET GUNS OF ANY KIND THAT YOU WANT YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING IS YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT THE UH
YOU CAN GUN TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOU KNOW MAYBE SOMEDAY WORLD GONNA GET WIPED OUT BY A ROBBER HERE AND THEN I'LL CHANGE MY MIND BUT
THERE'RE SO MANY ACCIDENTS WITH CHILDREN ACCIDENTLY GETTING A WHOLE GUNS
UH WHERE THE HUSBAND BEING OUT AT NIGHT AND THE WIFE HEARING RUST LIKE AT THE DOOR AND FORGOT TO KEEP THE WIND YOU GO- I'M UH I- I- I ACTUALLY DON'T WANT ONE OF MY HOUSE FOR THAT REASON
UH THERE'S JUST TOO MANY THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN THAT ARE BAD
YEAH
OH SURE

OH OKAY THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING THINGS SO UH YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I DID THIS AND THEN JUST THE OTHER GUY'S GOT A GUN AS FAR AS WHEN HE SEES IT IS AND IT'S UM IT'S ON THE FIRST SHOT UH I THINK THAT UH UH
YOU KNOW UH I- I- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE LEGITIMATE REASON FOR HAVING I'M THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IN THAT DON'T HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON I MEAN AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THEY'RE A LOT OF CRIMES OF PASSION
UH Y- YOU KNOW A GUY MAY HAVE ONE AT HOME FIRST PROTECTION BUT SUBWAY UH UH YEAH I W- FOR YOU GET DONE I GAME IN WITH A NEIGHBOR AND HE GOES HOME TO TAKE WHEN WE GET INTO THE HOT SUMMERS AND

I GUESS I DO- I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT
THE EXACT UH EDUCATION ARE FOR TEXAS IS I KNOW THAT THEY UH HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR CERTAIN CRIMES THAT'S PROBABLY THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT IS
IS UH IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE CRIME IS COMMITTED NOT BELIEVE ALL MY LIFE I GUESS HAS BEEN
AND YOU TAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET ENOUGH UH YEARS IN PLACE OF IT
UH THINGS BEING A CONTROVERSY ABOUT THAT
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS WELL THE THE PROBABLY TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF YOU AS AS FAR AS A CONTROVERSY GO SO I CAN SEE WHERE
IF THE LIFE WAS TAKEN BY ACCIDENT OR UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT NOT PREMEDITATED OR I GUESS PRIMARILY BY ACCIDENT
UH THERE MAY BE CASES FOR THE DEATH PENALTY IS NOT CALL FOUR
BUT I LEAN TOWARDS IT IT'S PREMEDITATED OR IF IT'S UH
KIND OF A HABITUAL OR UH OR I HAVEN'T THAT UH UH TENDS TO BE THE PEOPLE UH MAY GET INTO THAT I GUESS I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT
YEAH

OKEYDOKE BYE-BYE
YEAH UH I TEND TO AGREE WITH THE UH THE YOU KNOW PROBABLY PRETTY SIMILAR VIEWS ON IT BUT THAT'S
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IS SO MUCH OF A CONTROVERSY BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW I'VE I DO ALSO MYSELF BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UH
UH TH- YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY IRKS ME TO SEE SO MUCH EFFORT PUT INTO PREVENTING SOMEONE BEING PUT TO DEATH BY THE STATE WHEN THEY
SO CALLOUSLY UNUSUALLY SO YOU KNOW WITHOUT EVEN THINK HERE WITHOUT ANY CONCERN IS UH YOU KNOW IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE AND AND A LOT OF CASES SEVERAL PEOPLE'S LIVES
OH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WELL FILLED IT IF YOU'VE GOT A GUY WHO'S
HE'S BEEN THE TRIAL HAS BEEN IN IN IN JAIL AND YOU KNOW BASICALLY A FREE TIME LOSER FOR THE TWELVE TIMES YOU KNOW AND HE GOES OUT AND KILL SOMEBODY HE'S NOT BE REFORM THERE'S NOT ANY BETTER AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT GO
IT'S JUST NOT GOING GETTING BETTER AND AND THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A PAIN IN THAT
YOU KNOW DON'T DON'T HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT GIVE THEM LIFE IN JAIL AND YOU KNOW I COULD GO ALONG WITH THAT IF IF I COULD BE SURE THAT IT WOULD BE THEIR NATURAL LIFE IN JAIL AND NOT GROW OUT FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS
UM-HUM YEAH IT'S IT'S JUST
OUR CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS JUST SO I GUESS OVERLOADED BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE THE PROBLEM IS NOT
SO MUCH WITH A PRISON SYSTEM AND I MEAN BECAUSE THE THE CONTRACTOR DOING THEIR JOB ENFORCE THE LAWS IN PRISON SYSTEM OR JUST YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO COPE WITH THEM BUT
YOU KNOW THE THING ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS UH I'D YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A DETERRENT UH TO TO FUTURE CRIME IN THE WAY IT IS NOW UH IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU
IS LIKE THE STATE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE MY YOU
YOU KNOW MY EXCUSE SOMEBODY TWICE A YEAR YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S NO KIND OF CAR AND WE GOT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW AND AND MANY OF THEM WE'VE BEEN THERE FOR LITERALLY FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS ON DEATH ROW ON US

UM ONE PICKS UP REAL QUICK AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T AND YOU'RE RIGHT THEY DO GET BORED UM REALLY FAST IF THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE THAT THEY DO WITH WHICH IS YOUR SUGGESTIONS
UM-HUM I'VE EACH CHILD
EACH INDIVIDUAL IT'S UH
RIGHT
YEAH UM THAT'S
THAT'S TRUE THEY ONLY I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT THEY WOULD ARGUE ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW EVERY CHILD NEEDS TO WORK EVERY SUBJECT I MEAN THAT'S THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING
BUT I MEAN I I DEF- LIKE GREEK YOU  UM
RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S TRUE
UM
I UH I- I MEAN I CAN RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE I'D AND I'M GOING TO COLLEGE RIGHT NOW AND I FEEL LIKE I MEAN I'M TAKING A SISTER CLASS
AND I MEAN IT'S SO BORING AND I JUST HATE IT
UM THERE CAN HISTORY
BUT THE TAKE UM LIKE THIS IS LIKE EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS THROUGH I I THINK LIKE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE THAT'S NEAT EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS ON UP TO BASICALLY PRESENT
YEAH
YEAH THAT WELL THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING
YES OH YES DEFINITELY I AGREE
YEAH THERE'S
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH
ANYWAY THIS THIS UM SCHOOL SYSTEM THING I- I PAY I SAW SOMETHING ON THE NEWS SO
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE  TWO WEEKS AGO AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE FROM BUT I'M FROM THE DALLAS AREA
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT THEY HAD ONE SCHOOL
THAT UM IT'S IT'S STUDENTS DID SOMETHING WRONG UH I MEAN WHETHER IT WAS BEHAVIORAL OR UM YOU KNOW THEY WERE LOANING PROPERLY OR SOMETHING THEY TOOK THESE STUDENTS AND PUT THEM BASICALLY IN A CLOSET
WITH NO WINDOWS THEY HAD IT AT A TABLE OR NOT A TABLE BUT A DESK AND THIS CLOSET AND THEY HAD TO SIT IN THERE BY THEMSELVES
WELL PARENTS WERE GETTING REALLY ANGRY PUMP THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO WHY IS MY CHILD BEING PUT IN THIS CLOSET WH- HOW IS THAT HOPING MY CHILD
YOU KNOW AND
THE THE THING YOU KNOW THEY SAY WELL WE'RE GIVING THEM ISOLATION TIME IN THIS HELP THEM TO THINK
BUT A LOT OF KIDS IN IF THE CHILD HAS
UH CLAUSTROPHOBIA I MEAN THAT'S JUST A A TERRIFY THEM YOU KNOW AND
THAT'S TRUE BUT NO I MEAN THEY WERE I I MEAN I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH PARENTS I THINK THAT IS A VERY WRONG WAY TO HANDLE UH DISAPPOINTING UH CHILD PUTTING THEM IN
AND THEY WERE THEY WERE CAUGHT THEY CALL THEM THEY'RE QUITE ROOMS OR THEIR ISOLATION RENOVATING CALLED CLOSETS BUT THEY SHOW THESE ROOMS ON UM YOU KNOW ON THE NEWS AND I MEAN THEY LOOK BUCKO CLOTHS TO ME YOU KNOW WITH THE DESK AND THAT A REAL SMALL
BUT THEY SAID THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTION THEY CAME UP WITH WITH THE TAKE THE DOORS OFFER THESE ISOLATION WERE AND
I SAID NO WHAT GOOD IS I MEAN HOW IS THIS HOPING I MEAN EITHER WAY
YOU KNOW I'VE I DEFINITELY HEADED THIS -GREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT
THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO HANDLE A CHILD YOU KNOW DISCIPLINE THE TILE BUT PUT THEM IN A CLOSET
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH I UH
RIGHT
WELL
RIGHT
UM-HUM
I- I KNOW
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
WELL
UM I HAVE THAT I THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS
I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF UM
IT'S NOT JUST DISCIPLINE OKAY BIT OKAY FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DO IT UH MY KIDS SCHOOL UM THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL THE UH CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS
AND WHEN THE KIDS OR IN THE HOMES AND STUFF IN IF THEY'RE BEING REALLY DID I MEAN JUST BE I WANT THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW CUTTING UP AND SO ON THERE JUST STAND IN LINE DOING WHATEVER THEY SUPPOSED TO THEY GET ONE OF THESE CAUGHT BEING GOOD SWEAT
AND THEN WHEN THEY COLLECT THEM AT THE END OF EACH WEEK THEY GET TO GO TO THIS LITTLE WHAT THEY CALL THEY'RE CAUGHT BEING GOODS STORE AND THEN THEY GET TO SPEND THESE LIKE MONEY
WELL SEE TO ME THAT THAT POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT IS MUCH BETTER MUCH BETTER THAN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DISCIPLINE KIDS
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE GOOD AND TRYING TO EARN THOSE THINGS
YOU KNOW TO GET THE POSITIVE PART OF IT I MEAN THEY BROUGHT MUCH RATHER GO IN THE STORE AND BUY SOMETHING THEN BE SPANKED SO THERE DEFINITELY GONNA WORK TOWARDS BEING GOOD YOU KNOW RATHER THAN TRYING TO ACT UP TO BE BAD
YOU KNOW
YEAH
WELL THAT'S TRUE  I THINK I THINK IT'S REALLY THOUGH I MEAN THAT'S ONE THING THAT I MEAN MY KID DEFINITELY GET THINGS WHEN THEY NEED TO BE SPAYING
BUT I REALLY DO TRY TO USE POSITIVE UH REINFORCEMENT WITH THEM AT HOME ALSO AND IT REALLY HELPS THAT I MEAN THEY THEY DON'T GET THINGS VERY OFTEN BUT
THEY DO WHEN THEY DESERVE IT YOU KNOW BUT UM
I DON'T THINK ANY KIDS SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM BEING SPANK
I MEAN I- I THINK I WOULDN'T MIND OF THE TEACHERS BANK MY CHILD BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL A PAIN IN AND THAT'S NOT GONNA AN- AND I DON'T THINK THAT WHILE EVER CHANGE
THEY'RE NEVER GOT A LOT OF THE TEACHERS BAG OF CHILD AGAIN
BUT I DON'T THINK I MEAN SOME KIDS DON'T GET SPANK IT HOME AND SOME KIDS NEED TO BE SPANK IT
BUT I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT RIGHT WELL THERE'S SO MANY PARENTS THAT SAY YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE TILE ABOUT SPANK SOMEWHAT SHE IS TRUE BUCHANAN BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE CHILD NEEDS TO BE SPANK I MEAN THEY DO THINGS THAT THEY NEED THAT
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS
WELL EVERYBODY'S NOT AS KNOWING THAT NEEDED RENOVATION FOR YEARS THAT NEVER REALLY HAD A CLEAR DIRECTION OH WHICH WAY TO GO WITH THAT
THE FIRST DIRECTION THAT I CAN SEE HER
I WISH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM GO WITH A
KIDS LEARN A DIFFERENT RATES IN FOR TOO LONG THAT DON'T WANT EVERYBODY GIVE YOU LEARN THIS RAIN THIS FELLOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
YOU GET SOME KIDS WILL PICK UP ON THE FIRST THREE MISS- TALKING ABOUT THE READ THE OTHER FIFTY SEVEN ISSUE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A SUBSTITUTE BOREDOM
THE EDUCATORS YOU NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE
OPEN MINDED AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE IN DEALING WITH
UH VERY STUDENTS
TO GET THE MAXIMUM
POTENTIAL OUT OF THE PERSON
OUT OF EACH SHELL THEM KIDS IT'D BE GREAT WITH MECHANICAL STUFF OTHER KIDS ARE GOING TO BE
REALLY INTO MATH SUMMER REALLY GONNA BE HEAVY INTO READING RI-
INSTEAD OF
PUSHING THE SKILLS TOO FAR EITHER DIRECTION
I MEAN IT'S GREAT TO BE WELL ROUNDED HIT BE EXPOSED TO ALL THAT STUFF
YEAH THE WIND HITS THE POINT THE KIDS REALLY INTERESTED IN GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN THE STATE YOU NEED TO LEARN IT CAN REMEMBER IT
ANY EXPOSURE TO EVERY SATURDAY DON'T NEED TO BE A MASTER'S THAT RI-
E- EVERYTHING I LEARNED ABOUT CHANGES ROME'S IT HAS NOT HELP ME ANYWHERE MY AT ALL
OUR YOU KNOW  WE HAVE A SISTER CLASS THEY HADN'T GOTTEN THERE YET
THOSE ARE REALLY ONE
THEY COULD ACTUALLY COME BY AND TWO TWO HALF OF THE ONE FROM SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS ILL
THEY ENDED STILL WORKS BY AND THAT ONE AND THEN FOR MAKING THE SIDE PRESENTS I MAKE THAT YOU'RE STUCK THAT BECAUSE
YEAH THAT ONE ADULT ANYWAY WHAT THEY'RE DOING REAL POINT THE BOTTOM YOU KNOW THE EARLY PARTS OF IT YOU GIVING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NATION AND
BUT
EVEN BEEN THIS SKIMMING OVER A VERY G- ALMOST TRIVIA WITH IT YEAH
YEAH IT'S I MEAN THEY REALLY WANTED TO ME THE MATTER I MEAN THERE'S
THEY MAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE YOU KNOW THEY WERE GREAT MAN THE FATHER COUNTRY ALL THAT THEY HAD IT BUT THEY'RE NOT HIM AS ANYBODY ELSE  NOT MORE
YEAH MOST NOW I THINK YEAH
YOU KNOW HE ISOLATION CONCEPT REALLY WORK THEY GOOD WHY ARE PRISON'S OVERCROWDED
BUT BUT UM
THAT'S ONE PART OF THE REVAMPING OF THE ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM ON THAT ONE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM I WANNA SEE CHANGE TOO
WHEN I WAS BROUGHT UP
IF YOU CROSS LINE YOU BROKE A REAL BAD ENOUGH YOU'RE GETTING A THANKFUL IN THE EXTREME CAME IN NO YOU WE COULD NO LONGER SPANKING LIE A- ICE LIKE THAT
OKAY AND WE S- ONE THE PENDULUM BOTH WAYS TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND INSTEAD OF
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF DISCIPLINE THAT HAS BECAUSE WE'RE PUNISH THAT RIGHT
SHORT OF PHYSICALLY ISOLATING THE CHILD AND SORT OF PHYSICALLY HITTING THAT SHOW
WELL LET'S PUT HIM INTO A SITUATION WHERE OKAY YOU CROSS LIKE YOU BROKE THE REAL YOU GOT TO PAY FOR IT RIGHT
BUT
IT'S GOING TO TAX YOU PHYSICALLY
I HAVEN'T I MEAN

HAVE MORE POWER I THINK GORBACHEV THAT HAD IS THAT
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM TRUE
NO I SURE WOULDN'T TERM I'M BACK UM
UM-HUM
THE LEAST THEY'RE LI- LITTLE BIT FROM HISTORY AND UH
OKAY DO UH FI- STILL CAN FEEL THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS THAT JUST STILL LATE THREAT TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD ABSOLUTELY
NUMB UH REASONS ARE BASED UPON AND NOT ONLY FROM WHAT I READ THE NEWSPAPERS LESS YOU KNOW THE NEWSPAPERS BUT UP AGAINST SOME OF THE
FUN EXCITING THINGS I RENTED JU- JURY WAS SIX YEARS IS UH SOLD IN THIS THIS SPECIAL FORCES GROUP
WELL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE THE HEALTH CARE
DO YOU UM
UH GO BACK AND TIME A LITTLE BIT TO ABOUT EIGHTY ONE AND UH
WHEN MY FIRST REAL INVOLVED WITH THE MILITARY STARTED
UM
NATIONAL OOH OR THAT THE TIME THE SOVIET UNION WAS CONSIDER TO BE THE BIG MILITARY POWER IN THE BIG RATS WE'VE GOT A LOT QUITE A BIT OF
INFORMATION AS WELL AS INDOCTRINATION ALSO BE TACTICS THE WEAPONS
WHAT THE LEBANON IN EIGHTY THREE BEFORE THE MARINES EVER GOT THERE WITH THE YOU'D PEACE KEEPING FORCE
AND WITH THE TRAINING I RECEIVE PRIOR TO GOING THERE WITH CAPTURED WEAPONS WE KEPT RUNNING UP AGAINST
THESE WARRANTIES WERE CHINESE MADE COPIES THESE WERE SOVIET MADE TOP ALIGNED FRESH YEAH THE BOX AK-47
THAT'S ALL OF A LOT OF EXPOSES WE'RE RUNNING INTO
IN GRANADA IN OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH AT THREE WE INVADED PLACE
SURE THEY WERE CUBANS THOSE THERE BUT THERE'S ALSO A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN ADVISE THERE WERE DAMN GOOD SHOTS
THE TEAM I WAS WITH WHICH JUMPED IN ON THE WESTERN TIP OF OF THE ISLAND DON'T POINT SALINAS
AND FOR EVERY TWO THERE'S AT LEAST FIVE RUSSIAN ADVISORS
THEY'RE ALL SHE DIDN'T STAY THE ART SOVIET WEAPONS
AT FORM
I WAS DOWN IN CENTRAL AMERICA IS THE SIZE THE HONDURAN ARMY
AGAIN WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST CUBANS QUITE A BIT PLUS SO YOU'D SIZE THERE'S
I THINK WE WERE WE WERE CAPTURING AND TAKING FROM THE BECAUSE I'VE WAS WAS BRAND NEW OUT OF THE CREPE SOVIET MADE MATERIAL
SO I CONSIDER THEM A THREAT ABSOLUTELY
A UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW CUP OF TREES DO YOU WANT BUT UNIVERSITY
I LIKE A NEVER U T WERE THE TEACHING SUBJECTS LIKE THAT THE KITCHEN TERRORISM
SO THE PEOPLE WITH A BIG IS ELEVEN OVER GRADUATES THAT PLACE AND WE'D SAY THEY ARE NOT A NICE TO GO UP AGAINST
I'M SURPRISED DOING THIS TO ROCKY CRISIS WE DIDN'T HAVE MORE
INTO THE THAN THEY DID
HE'S GOT OUR TOPIC ALIVE
LIKE WHEN A GRADUATE FROM THERE
THEY CAN PULL TERRACED ACT- ANYWHERE IN THE FREE WORLD
AND THEY ARE VERY VERY GOOD WHAT THEY DO
SO IN TILL I SEE THE ENTIRE
QUOTE OLD GUARD
OF THE SOVIET MILITARY OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
COMPLETELY REAL OVER IN DISAPPEAR PREFERABLY AERATE
I STILL CONSIDER THEM A THREAT
THE MILITARY'S DIFFER FROM CARS TO WHERE THEY ARE EXTREMIST YOU'RE GENERALS THAT ACTUALLY CONTROLLED TENT AND THOUSANDS
OF TROOPS
THAT YOUR CAR WAS IT WAS SO GOOD POLICY IS THEY GONNA DO WITH THE GENERAL TELLS THEM
WELL THAT'S A INTERESTING WATCHING THE DIFFERENT  SOVIET STATES ALBANIA MISCELLANEOUS
DOING THEIR LITTLE REVOLTS DOWN THERE
EACH ONE OF THOSE SECTORS IT'S GOT A SEVERE GENERAL OVER THE TROOPS THAT ARE THERE
SO FAR THEY HAD RUN INTO THE REAL PSYCHO IS YET
THERE'S PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX WHICH SHOULD BE EQUAL THE BARGE WHAT SHE'S THE STAFF THAT ARE IN POSITIONS OVER SOME OF THESE SOVIET STATES
UPRISINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN THEIR SECTORS
IT REALLY IS GONNA BE A TOTAL BLOOD THA-
ACTUALLY THEY'RE SHOWING REMARKABLE RESTRAINT
THEY GET REAL NASTY THE HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS COME OUT AND THEY
WOULD LEVEL ENTIRE AREAS
OKAY YOU FROM THE DALLAS AREA RIGHT
OKAY YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE SIZE OF OF THE AREA ROUTE RICHARDSON
YOU PUT FIVE SO BEHIND YOU HELICOPTERS IN THERE THEY CAN LEVEL THE ENTIRE AND WILL BE ANYTHING ALIVE
THEY CAN DO THAT ABOUT FOUR BIT
THEY GET TIRE SQUATTERS OF THOSE JUST PAINTING BYE
DO YOU TURN AFGHANISTAN DIDN'T REMARKABLY WELL CONSIDERING THE TRAIN OR FLYING AND
BUT I'LL HIGHLY POPULATED AREAS LIKE SOME OF THE SOVIET CITIES WOULD BE A
WITH THE WEAPONRY IT'S PASSED ON THOSE THINGS THERE IS NO PLACE TO HIDE
BUT THE BOMBS DON'T GET YOU GET THE BULLET STUCK IT USED AND THEN THE NERVE GAS DEFINITELY WITH YOU
THE ONLY DRAWBACK ON THAT'LL PIECE MACHINE IS ONLY GOT FIVE MINUTES OF THEIR TIME
THE DRINK THAT MUCH FUEL
WHERE YOU HAVE YOU I THINK IF YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ANY TIME OF THE MILITARY
AS AS A BILLION THAT NEVER BEEN A TEST ANY FORM OF THE MILITARY
A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN NEVER DID MAKE THE NEWSPAPERS BUT
DOING THE SAME TIME PERIOD THEN YOU GET SOME FEELINGS I MEAN THEY GETTING ALL THESE WEAPONS AND STUFF
DID THAT
LIKE YOU A LITTLE BIT WHY THEY KEPT COMING UP WITH ALL THIS STUFF
IN ANY OF THEM SINCE EIGHTY ONE UH
ALL BOILS DOWN TO I EVER THAT'S OUR SIDE THERE'S THAT IT'S A MATTER OF MONEY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
THE DEAL THE ROCKIES HAVE THE RUSSIANS OIL
UH WAS TO THE SOUTH OF MORE REBUILT CONFLICT
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THAT WORRIED ABOUT
INVADING NORTH
THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN THEY'VE GOT A SCREW THAT SITUATION I GIVE THEM THAT
FROM MEXICO ALL THE WAY DOWN IN THIS CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA SITUATION THERE IS WEIRD THAT'S VERY SCREWED UP
PLACE IN THIS UH THIS WORLD THE GOVERNMENT SWITCH
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TECHNICALLY SUPPORTED FOR YEARS CORRUPTS IS ALL GET OUT
AND GENERALLY PEOPLE GET SCREWED THE TIRED AND THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER TEAM THAT THAT MEANS GOING COMMUNISM
OF COURSE WE YELTSIN'S GOT TOO MANY CONNECTIONS WITH THE OLD GUARD
THAT'S THE ONLY DRAWBACK THAT I SEE THE ENTIRE THING GORBACHEV HAS MADE VISIT HIM AND HE SAID IT'S PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THE OLD GUARD ITSELF
YELTSIN'S IN TIGHT WITH THE OLD GUARD
SO IT MAY BE TRYING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS AT THIS POINT
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY PULL THE TROOPS OUT OF UM
OTHER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IN EUROPE AFTER THE BERLIN WALL AWFUL THAT WAS RIGHT
BUT BY NO MEANS TOO LOUD
INDOOR STORM PRO- PULLING EVERYBODY UM
IT MAY BE
HOW MUCH REDUCED FORCED TO WHAT WE USED TO HAVE OVER THERE
BUT YOU STILL BUT THEY HAVE THE KEY PLAYERS IN PLACE IF SOMETHING DOES GO DOWN EVEN IF IT'S A REGIONAL CONFLICT
IF
UNITED STATES IS GOING UP LIKE A SMALL SCHOOL BE THE SUPERPOWERS THAT IT IS
NOT ONLY DOES IT YOU CAN TALK I THOUGHT WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO WALK WALK IT'S GOT TO HAVE THE STUFF TO BACK BACK UP WITH A AND
IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT A TOKEN FORCED THERE YOU CAN'T HOLD YOU GROUND

HAS A
I I COULDN'T BELIEVE I BECAUSE I MEAN I USED TO LIVE IN ATLANTA YEARS AGO AND IT WAS ALWAYS FAIRLY CLEAN THEM YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS YOU DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS STAGNANT AIR LIKE LIKE LA DOES
BUT WHAT IT WAS REALLY BAD THAT DAY
AND
YEAH

UH I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PRIORITY IS IS THAT LIKE IN ATLANTA THEY HAVE UM THEY HAVE MANDATORY CATALYTIC CONVERTER INSPECTIONS

TREES DON'T SCRUB THE AIR AND THEIR YAR-
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU GOT ALL THESE FOLKS CUTTING DOWN THE RAIN FORCES QUICK AS THEY CAN
I WONDER TOO YOU KNOW THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT OZONE DEPLETION AND ALL THIS
IT IT SEEMS FUNNY THAT IT'S COMING AROUND AT THE TIME WHEN WE'RE LOSING THE MOST MOST OF THE FORCE
BECAUSE I I I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE POLLUTANTS AND STUFF WERE BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE YEAR

THE OZONE DETERIORATION IS GREATER THAN THEY HAD ORIGINALLY THOUGHT OVER SOME OF THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS I SOLD IT'S SCARY TO THINK ABOUT

IN ORDER TO PUT MORE PEOPLE IN INTO THE JAILS AND IT WAS JUST THE AMAZING
TO ME AND OF COURSE THEY MADE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THE FEW OF THE GOT OUT AND TURNED AROUND AND COMMIT A CRIME WITHIN FIVE DAYS GETTING OUT AND
BEING REARRESTED
OH

OH I DON'T REMEMBER MYSELF
UM
I THINK IF THEY IF THEY STARTED EXECUTING THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS

AND UH THIS MAN WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING UH I THINK IT WAS TWO PEOPLE UH AND SHOOTING A UH A POLICEMAN
UM POINT BLANK IN THE FACE COURSE HE DIDN'T DIE AND UH THIS IS DURING A HOLD UP OF THE UH UH A RESTAURANT AND IT CAME OUT DURING THE TRIAL THAT DON'T THINK THEY HAD TRIED ROBIN OTHER PLACE
AND UH WHEN THE GUY CAME OUT THE BAG THEY THOUGHT WAS MONEY IT TURNED OUT TO BE A COUPLE COOKIES
AND UH YOU'RE JUMBO COOKIES AND AND SO THEY WERE SO UPSET FORMAL I MEAN THIS GUY YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO THIS WHOLE THAT THAT DIDN'T WORK
THAT THEY QUITE LITERALLY WERE MAD AND WENT INTO A RESTAURANT THE WHOLE PLACE UP INTO STARTED IN SHOOTING PEOPLE
YOU KNOW IT'S
YEAH
YEAH YOU GET INTO REALLY  YEAH IT'S
AND UH IT TURNED OUT TO THE MAN POLICEMAN SURVIVE TO THE POINT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW IDENTIFIED AGAIN
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY TRY TO MAKE THE COPS LOOK OUT LIKE HE WAS A A UH A NO GOOD ROTTEN DRUNK
I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING
OH YOU WAS FOUND GUILTY YEAH HE UH UH
THE LAST I HEARD HE UH
IN A BIG PUSH FOR THE DEATH PENALTY <UNK> THEY FINALLY GOT IT AND I DON'T KNOW I KIND OF UH
IT STOPS LISTENING AFTER A WHILE
UM YOU KNOW HE WOULD COME HOME AND AND YOU KNOW AFTER THE TRIAL WAS EVERY CAME HOME UNTIL THE SCHOOLS GOES HOME AND COURSE THEN THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO JUST YOU KNOW AFTER
YEAH BECAUSE
RIGHT
AND UH EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE
AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEY WANT TO DO IT AND HE WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE HE'S OUT THERE WAS GONNA BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE IN THE CASE FOR
WERE LITTLE HAS AND THEN ON CONVICTED HIM WITH SOME OF THE CHARGES BUT I MEAN ALL CAME DOWN THEY JUST
THAN AN HOUR
THE SIZE OF THE MAN SAY
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL IT IT IT WENT PRETTY PRETTY QUICK FROM WHAT YOU SAID
BUT I MEAN IT'S THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER CRIMES UP THERE I MEAN BESIDES MURDER I THINK UH NOW IF YOU'RE DEALING DRUGS NOW CALLED WOULDN'T TWICE OR SOMETHING
UM THAT THERE'S A A DEATH PENALTY SO SHE WAS IT
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH I AGREE
YEAH I AGREE I I'VE I HAVE A A LITTLE TOLERANCE FOR THAT KIND OF UH THAT KIND OF PERSON
AND UH AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SOME OTHER CRIMES THAT I THINK UH YOU KNOW
KIDNAPPING UH YOU KNOW WHEN THEY
I MEAN KIDNAPPING PER SE HAS A CERTAIN UH
UH
FINE AND THAT'LL BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT
OH WELL IT'S IT'S A DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S BEING CARRIED OUT VERY WELL IN MY OPINION
SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES SO LONG BETWEEN
CONVICTION AND CARRYING OUT THE PENALTY THAT I DON'T SEE THAT MAKES ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY
YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM WELL FROM WHAT I AND ISSUE I BUT IT'S JUST A JUST A FEW DAYS AGO UM
SO FAR THIS YEAR OR WAS IT DURING THE LAST YEAR SOMEWHAT DURING A YEAR'S TIME I THINK A LOT THEM EXECUTED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE IN THE NATION MEANWHILE THERE WERE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW
SO UH THAT BUILDING UP YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE CAN BEGINNING FAXES AND THEIR EXECUTING THEM SO IT'S REALLY BUILDING OUT
UM-HUM
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S GOT THAT
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
ISN'T THAT IN MARYLAND WHERE THE FAMOUS WILLIE HORTON TOO CLOSE
IT WAS A LOT OF WINDOWS YOU SO MUCH IN THE CAMPAIGN
IN THE POLITICAL IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACES
I'M IN I'M IN I'M IN MARYLAND THE MID M- IN MASSACHUSETTS I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYWAY WELL THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK I- IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER NOT A CRIMINAL COMMITS A CRIME YOU THINK YOU CAN IF IT'S DONE RIGHT
IT'S IT'S
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL I THINK A LARGE MEASURE THE REASON THEY DON'T CARE IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENT BUT SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT COMMIT CRIMES DON'T GET PUNISHED
THE POLICE DON'T CATCH THEM OR THE COURTS DON'T CONVICTED MORE OR THEY DON'T SERVE VERY MUCH OF THE TIME AND SO UM
YOU KNOW THERE AT THE THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS VERY HIGH CRIME DOES TAKE YOU MAKE GOOD LIVING THAT
YEAH
LAST YEAR'S DC I GUESS BALTIMORE CAUGHT THEM
UM-HUM
YEAH
AND THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS SO MANY OF THE MURDERS ARE YOU KNOW THE THE VIOLIN PEOPLE GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND SO THEY YOU KNOW SOCIETY'S NOT GOING TO PUT INTO THE POLICE MAYBE THE GUY THE CROSS NEXT TIME IS GONNA
UM I THINK
I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE SAY YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF PERSON IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR OUR SOCIETY AND WE ARE THEIR FI- GOING TO REMOVE THEM FROM SOCIETY NOT TEMPORARILY BE- PERMANENTLY
I MEAN I BUY PERSON THINK LIFE IMPRISONMENT
I DON'T THINK MUCH OF A LOT OF LIFE IN PRISON FOR SMALL IT'S NEVER TURNS OUT TO BE LIKE THE SECOND YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE
THE IDEA OF LIFE IMPRISONMENT WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE WHAT I MEAN YOU'RE GONNA PUT THEM IN A CAGE YOU THINK IT'S NEVER EVER GONNA BE SAFE FOR THEM TO WALK THE STREETS AGAIN WELL THEN
WHY BOTHER JUST EXECUTE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S THAT WAY YOU'RE SURE THEY'LL NEVER EVER GONNA WALK THE STREETS AGAIN
SO ANY ANY ANYBODY THIS OF LIFE IN PRISON WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE I'D SAY UH GETTING THE DEATH PENALTY
SO
SO AND AND ALSO UM
THOSE
THIS THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT A LOT OF THESE COURT TRIALS A LOT OF THESE APPEALS AS IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT IS TRUE IN WHAT IT'S CALLED A RATHER IT'S ON THE OTHER THAN WHAT KIND OF HIDE AND WHAT DO I HAVE TO TELL
AND I THINK OUR COURT SHOULD BE GEARED MUCH MORE STRONGLY COURTS PLANO THE TRUTH THAN THE CURRENTLY ARE
AND AND THAT WAY WE CAN BE SURE YOU KNOW WE CAN FIND OUT THE TRUTH YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
AND THEN BASE
THE SENTENCE ON WHAT THE PERSON DID NOT ON WHAT WERE ALLOWED TO LET THE JURY HERE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
CISTERCIAN PEOPLE
BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT THE FIRST JOB AND
SO ANOTHER GOING TO GET EVEN
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
SO IF THE VERDICT VOTE THE RESULT THERE
OH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
THE PENALTY PHASE YEAH THEY DECIDE THE PENALTY SEPARATELY FROM THE VERDICT
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT'S YOU WELL THE OTHER S- REALLY TWO SEPARATE DECISIONS ARE I GUESS ONE IS JUST DID A REALLY HAPPEN THE WAY THE THE PROSECUTOR SAYS THAT HAPPENS
YOU KNOW IS THIS MAN REALLY GUILTY YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THAT TH- TH- THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER OF SOCIETY WHAT DO I WANT TO DO WITH THIS GUY WHO DID THIS THING
AND NOW I'VE I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A JURY I NEVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I NOT SURE I'D LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THAT KIND OF DECISION ABOUT A MAN'S LIFE
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL THE THE THING I'D BE MOST LIKELY TO A TEST THE DEATH PENALTY WAS THIS VIOLENCE I MEAN YEAH I CAN HANDLE PEOPLE PEOPLE SELLING DRUGS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S WRONG BUT
IT'S IT'S NOT WORTH DO- SOMEBODY DIDN'T EXECUTED FOR BUT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN HOW IT'S NOT SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN THESE RANDOM DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS AND THAT SORT OF THING
AND THE PEOPLE LIKE MOST LIKELY WANNA SENTENCED TO DEATH OF THE PEOPLE TO JUST SO REALLY LITTLE REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO TURN I HEARD THE NEXT PERSON BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO THEM WHETHER SOMEONE ELSE COULD TURN OR NOT
AND SO I GO WHAT YOU NEED TO THE KIND OF PEOPLE I WOULD LIKE TO GET GET OUT OF HERE AND GET OUT OF CIRCULATION FAT NO WE DON'T ACCEPT YOU'RE KIND IN OUR SOCIETY
UM-HUM

UH REAGAN ADMINISTRATION COMING RIGHT OFF THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION DID TEN TO BRING BACK A MORE AGGRESSIVE UH
UH ASPECT TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND A SORT OF THINGS THAT THE MARKS IN THIS COUNTRY IS RESISTED FOR IT YOU KNOW AND UH BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE LINE LIKE COMPARED TO THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES
AND I THINK THAT WAS A POSITIVE UH CLOSET SAYING BUT IT SEEMS LIKE UH
UH WITH ALL THAT THOUGH WE NEVER SEEM TO BE A BIG AT OUR HOUSE IN ORDER LIKE COME TO THE ECONOMIC THINGS I BRING US BACK TO THE AT LEAST UH IT SEEMS LIKE WE STILL CONTINUE TO RUN UH
UH MAYBE IN UH IN IN IN DATED BUDGETS AND LIKE I DON'T SEE ANY REAL WAY OUT OF IT EITHER MONDAY
YEAH BUT
YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT'S TRUE

AND I AM THE THE OLD TIMER STRUCTURE OF THE MOTHERS IN THE GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDPA WAS MAYBE SOME GREAT GRANDPARENTS OCCASIONALLY THAT'S EVEN BROKER PART PRETTY PRETTY WELL INCLUDING THE FAMILY STRUCTURE ZING IN ITSELF

I DON'T KNOW SORT OF A STABLE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINE THEM UH UH I KNOW SOME AN- ON THIS AND THIS MOMENT CERT- SOCIAL ORDER THAT'S IT AND I- I
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH AND MY MY FAMILY AND ALMOST LESSER SAVAGES TABBY LIVING UP IN MARYLAND THOUGH BUT MY FAMILY UM WE'RE W-
WE STILL LIKE OUR ROOMS AND LIKE TO GET BACK HAVE FAMILY REUNIONS AND ALL THAT
AND I THINK THAT MAY NOT BE THE NORM PUTS A LOT OF PEOPLE AS MUCH IT IS PLUS TOTAL AND DO THAT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I MUST SAY TWO SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE FLAVOR OF UH WAR HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY LOOKING BACK AT THE VIETNAM ERA
AND WHAT ALL IT THROUGH THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THEIR OFFICE SITUATION IT SEEMS LIKE UH WE HAVE UH MADE UH A UH OR RATHER
UH MAJOR ABOUT FACE IN TERMS OF WEIGHTS AND UH POUR IN THE WAY WE WE UH CAN TECHNOLOGICAL EVEN A CARRY OUT A WAR
YEAH THEY ARE BEHIND THAT DESERT
WELL THEN TOO I THINK THAT PHILOSOPHIES CHANGE I WAS JUST READING TONIGHT IN THE ONE OF THE NEWS MAGAZINES THAT YOU CAN TAKE IT I- I TAKE NEWSWEEK TIMING US NEWS OR OR REPORT ALL THREE IS MY BACK
AND I WAS JUST READING IN ONE OF THE OF THOSE UH NEWS MAGAZINES THAT UH THERE'S A UM
COME MOVEMENT UH MILK CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT THE UPPER HIERARCHY UH OFFICER STAFF
TO UH CHANGE TO KIND OF WAY WE'D CONDUCTED MORE IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF UH IT'S TO THE MAIN THE THE ENEMY SO HIS OWN INSTEAD OF DOING MORE FEIGNING AND AND AND AND TECHNOLOGICALLY APPROPR- ATTACK US LIKE BE SMART MONTHLY BUDGET DOING MORE
MORE SMART THINGS THEY'RE VERY DAMAGING GETTING IN GETTING OUT OF MAKING IT RUNS LUNG MACREE A TV AT THE DOOR EXXON LEVELS APP- HE WAS SLEEPY AND STUFF OUT AND DO THINGS
THEN UH HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST FOR THAT HE WAS TO MAJOR IN ME SO THEY HAD ON THE LIKE I THINK POLITICALLY WE'VE CHANGED A LOT I THINK IN THE VIETNAM WAR
UH WE WE CONGRESS GOT TOO MUCH INVOLVED IN AND TRYING TO MANAGE THE WAR
YEAH AND AND THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY THE WRONG WAY HURTING THE CONDUCTOR WARM-UP ANY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN A WAR RIGHT OR WRONG YOU SHOULD LET THE MILITARY STASH AND AND AND THE AND GIVE THEM THE JOB THAT THEY'RE PAID IN SUPPOSEDLY STEAL THE DOING
AND THAT DIDN'T GET ON WITH INSTEAD OF TYING THEIR HANDS WHICH I FELT LIKE WAS NOT THE CASE THE VIETNAM WAR BUT WAS ENTIRELY ADOPTED IN CASE THERE ROCKY WERE
WELL THE MORE LESS GAVE IT TO SOURCE PROBLEM AND AND THE REST OF THE MILITARY IS IN JUST AS A TO HANDLE IT AND THEY DID
AND I THINK THE MILITARY APPROVED ITSELF COP TO TO DO EXACTLY WHAT IT'S PAID TO DO AND UH IT JUST GOES TO GIVE ME UH SEEING THAT UH WE DID SOMETHING'S WRONG
I THINK IN THE VIETNAM ERA UH IN THAT UH CAUTIOUS PAY THAT MUCH PASTA
BUT UH THAT I SEE IS UH CHANGE AND THEN INDUSTRIALLY GOING BACK TO UH I THINK I- UH UH AND UH SHE WE CHANGE I THINK WE COME THROUGH AN AIR OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OR SO T- T- AND HOW THEY UH
THE NATION IT WAS INDUSTRIAL ORIENTED TOWARDS UH MANUFACTURING TYPE INDUSTRIES AND I THINK NOW WE'RE SEEING OURSELF TRANSITIONING UNTIL MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ELECTRONICS H- WORDS
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION AND AND COMPUTERS THAT IS REALLY OUR NEXT INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION
AND UH YOU KNOW A SURPRISE ME LEAST ORBIT IF WE CAN SEE THE WHOLE IDEA OF MATTER FACT FROM ALL THOSE ALIKE EXCEPT TO SOME DEGREE WE HAVE TO KEEP A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERTISE IN THE HOUSE THAT BEING A BASIC SPORT TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES ANYBODY'S MIGHT FUNDING IN JAPAN AND
AND UH UH MAJOR POWERS LIKE THE THE THE BRITISH AND THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN ECONOMY'S BEING LESS THAN THIS DEPENDENT UPON THAT KIND OF INDUSTRY
UH BECAUSE IT'S UH SOMEONE LABOR INTENSIVE EVEN TO START ROBOTIZING IT UH UH I I'M CONCERNED THAT WOULD BE THE CASE INSTEAD THE MORE
UH ADVANCE STATIONS TEND TO GET MORE COMPUTERIZED MORE TELECOMMUNICATION OR ANYTHING LIKE ANY INFORMATION IS GETTING TO BE UH SO THE THING
UH I THINK I DON'T KNOW
UM YEAH I THINK IT'S I- I- I THINK WE MADE SOME MISTAKES DO FIRST I THINK THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT REALLY KEPT ABREAST OF WHAT'S GOING ON INDUSTRIALLY
AND UH GIVING THEM LESS TIME UPSET TWO YEARS BECAUSE I I MY BACKGROUND IN PHYSICS <UNK> AND UH I'VE SPENT TWO YEARS AT THE AGE CASES IN THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT REACTED
TWO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL UH UH UH INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTIONARY STAY THE COUNTRY AND ABOUT IT I MEAN WHEN I WAS GOING TO DO YOU GOT YOUR BASIC STUFF IS
AND UH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ABOUT YET
AND UH WHEN I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL I HAD TO SEW TEACH MYSELF EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED UH ABOUT COMPUTERS IN PROGRAMMING AND AND JUST YOU KNOW THE WHOLE GETS HARDWARE IN GENERAL TO TO UH YOU CAN DO THINGS WITH A DATE ACQUISITION PROCESS LIKE
AND UH WHEN I WAS TOO YOU HAD TO HAVE MATHEMATICS IF YOU WERE IN ENGINEERING OUR SON'S OR ANY OF THE OF THE SUBJECT THOSE CHEMISTRY BOSTON LIKE
BUT YOU NEVER HAD TO HAVE COMPUTERS AND EVEN TO THIS DATE IN COLLEGE IS JUST NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE COMPUTER COURSES IF YOU'RE THE IN THE ENGINEERING OR THE SUN SEALS
WELL THEY SURE COMPUTER SCIENTIST OR OR SOMEONE IN THAT AREA AND THEN IS REQUIRED COURSES PART CREEK AND UH JUST AS WE HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR OF ENGLISH IN IN IN COLLEGES AND A YEAR SOME SORT OF SOCIAL STUDY

WELL WE HAVE UH A THIS WOULD BE UH UH THEY REUNION FOR NOT MY GRANDFATHER BUT MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER AND THEN MY GREAT AND THEN MY GRANDFATHER SO IT'S A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS
UM AND THESE WERE TINY AREA TOO CAME ACROSS THE PLANES
AND UM THE FAMILIES WHERE ARE QUITE LARGE AND SO WE HA- WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO GATHER UP
UH NAMES AND ADDRESS THOSE LOVE FOR ALL THE TIME THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED
SO IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY
UM BUT ACTIVITY THEY WANT
WELL CAN YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT OVER IN A DAY PERIOD
UH THEY WILL NOT EVERYONE WON'T BE THERE FOR THE WHOLE TIME BUT FAMILIES CAN COME IN DURING THAT AT A TIME AND KIND OF NEAT ON THE ON THE LIVING FAMILY LEVEL
LIKE UH I WILL COME THERE KIND OF EARLY AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IF I WAS SO CALM SO THAT WE CAN GET ACQUAINTED AND THEN
UH THAT GOES BACK TO THE GENERATION BEFORE WILL JOIN US AND THEY MAY MEET KIND OF INDIVIDUALLY THIS CAMPING AREA
AND THEN UH TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK THERE WILL BE TOO SPECIFIC DAYS WHEN WE HONOR THEY USED TO UH UH
A GROUP MY THE GRANDFATHER'S AND THE GREAT GRANDFATHER
AND UH SO IT'S KIND OF ONCE MORE COMBINING THE WHOLE GROUP AGAIN
BUT UH IT'S IT IT IT IT REQUIRES A LOT OF UH LOGISTICS FOR FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE TO MEET
AND A LOT OF UH ARRANGING FOR ACTIVITIES
UH
WELL UM COURSE YOU WANNA DO SOME KINDS OF THINGS THAT WHICH WILL HELP THEM TO GET TO KNOW OF A ANCESTOR THAT YOUR HONOR AND
BUT BESIDES THAT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN AND AND DIFFERENT AGES YOU NEED TO TRY TO FIND THINGS
THAT UH THAT THEY WERE JUST LIKE TO DO TOGETHER SO THAT THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY'S THOSE REUNION THEY WON'T RUN LIKE
THE WHOLE WAY AND
SO I HAVE TO BE PRETTY FUN TOO I THINK UH WE'RE WE'RE GOING THAT GOING TO YOU TALK TO UH A PLACE FAIR PARK CITY
AND UH AND IT'S UH A PRETTY GOOD SIZE AREA WHERE THEY'LL BE HIKING AND AND THEN THEY WILL BE THE
OH JUST THE GENERAL KINDS OF THINGS LIKE UH SWIMMING AND WHATEVER DURING THAT IN THE IN THE AREA ROUNDABOUT WHICH THEY WILL DO DURING THE DAYS WHEN THEY WANT TO
WHEN THEY'RE NOT UH OF REHEARSING OR WHATEVER FOR PART OF A A PLATE NUMBER KIND OF GET TOGETHER AND AND UH WORK OUT SOME SMALL
OH YEAH IT'S OR OR UH A TAX OR THINGS LIKE THAT MUSICAL NUMBERS
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE TOGETHER EARLY DURING THE WEEK WILL HELP US TO GET TOGETHER TO PREPARE THOSE THINGS FOR THE FOR THE PROGRAMS AT THE END OF THE WEEK
SO IT IT IT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT NOW WE ALWAYS BEFORE WE HAVE ONLY HAD MY GRANDFATHER IS FAMILY AND UM
WE ONLY THERE FOR ONE DAY
AND UH THE LAST TIME WE DO WE WERE DOING EVERY TWO YEARS AND WE DECIDED LAST TIME WE WERE WAIT A THIRTY YEAR BECAUSE IT CAME ACROSS SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO GET THERE AND UM
SOME PEOPLE COME FROM BACK EAST AND COURSE I COME FROM TEXAS SO THERE'S SOME OF THIS COMPANY QUITE A WAYS
AND UH AND SO WE WE HAD A LITTLE LONGER AND DECIDED TO TRY TO HOLD IT
UH IN A SITUATION THAT WAS A LITTLE LONGER LIKE CAMPING SITUATION SOMETHING THAT WASN'T TOO EXPENSIVE BUT
UH COULD BE MORE OF A VACATION SITUATION FOR FAMILIES TO COME AND PARTICIPATE IN WELL GETTING TO KNOW THEIR ANCESTORS AND RELATIVES
UH SO THAT MAYBE THEY DISTRACTED MORE TO BRING THEIR FAMILIES
NO I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ALL MY FAMILY TO COME BEFORE BUT THEY SURE I HAVE UH A SEVERAL MARRIED DAUGHTERS AND UH AND SOME TWO FAMILIES OR COMING IN THAT SO IT IT IT LOOKS TO BE A LOT MORE INTERESTING ACTIVITY
WELL UM THE ANCESTORS CAME FROM THERE
AND I AND THAT WE WE WERE HOLDING THEIR BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME LIVING ANCESTORS UP UNTIL
UH FAIRLY RECENTLY AT THIS POINT IN THAT GENERATION THAT WE'RE HONORING
THERE'S ONLY WELL MY MOTHER IS NINETY THREE AND SHE WON'T GO THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD ON OR
BUT UH THERE'S ONE OTHER WIFE BUT ALL OF THEM ALL THE CHILDREN ARE NOW GONE THEY'VE THEY'VE PASSED AWAY IN THE MEANTIME
AND SO UH I THAT'S WHY WE WERE GOING FOR THAT REASON WE'RE GOING THERE
BUT IT'S JUST THEY'RE JUST MORE OF THEM AND THEY'RE STILL OVER THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THE REST OF US ARE KIND OF STRING AROUND THAT WERE BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONVENIENT FOR THE BIGGEST MAJORITY IT STILL IS THERE
WELL SO WE HAD A WE HAD UH AS A MEMBER WHO WAS INTR- ARE COVERED IN GENERAL AS TIME HAD SOME ACCESS TO THE SPARK WHICH WAS A BIG FACTOR
WHETHER WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO UP THERE AGAIN BUT THERE ARE OTHER KIND OF RANGES LIKE IN IN UH

OH YOU DO YOU DO

THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA
ALL KINDS OF LAND
I WOULD SAY IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD IF YOU VISITED LEAST FOUR FIVE COLLEGES BEFORE THEY EVEN YOU KNOW GO TO ATTEND GO DOWN AND VISIT FOR THE WEEKEND THEY DO HAVE THOSE PROGRAMS WRITTEN DOWN THERE
UH WE- WELL NO UH ACTUALLY UH MY MY DAUGHTER'S QUITE YOUNG YET BUT UH I WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL UH AND I FIND IT OVERALL THEY'RE PROBABLY MUCH CHEAPER
IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IS PROBABLY I WOULD SAY NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU GET AT YOU KNOW MOST OF YOUR LIKE A&M TEXAS AND UH YOU KNOW VANDERBILT SOME OF THOSE
I THINK THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT PROBABLY IN SIZE AND AND AND PASSIVE CLASSES AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT ON ALL I THINK THE THE EDUCATION LEVELS PROBABLY JUST AS GOOD IF YOU IF YOU PURCHASE A STATES UH
YEAH
WELL I TELL YOU IT IT'S EXPENSIVE COURSE I WORKED MY WAY THROUGH AND UH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA IN SOME CASES IF THAT NOW THEY IS JUST SO EXPENSIVE
WELL YEAH IT IT IT IT CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE REAL QUICK YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST I WANNA PAY MY PAY THE TUITION
YOU KNOW GIVERS TRANSPORTATION IF IT'S NECESSARY AND COURSE I'D LIKE TO LIVE IN A DORM IF IT'S POSSIBLE
BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WORK I- I WOULD I WOULD DON'T LIKE SHE HAS A LITTLE PART TIME JOB TURN JUST A LITTLE EXTRA SWIMMING THAT SORT OF THING
IN SUMMER WORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU JUST TENDS TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH BUT UH I DON'T WANT UH TO HAVE HER FEEL FINANCIALLY YOU KNOW BIRD AND UH AND NOT YOU KNOW CONCENTRATE ON STUDY AND THAT SORT OF THING
BUT UH I KNOW LIKE
I GUESS PROBABLY ONE OF THINGS THAT THAT I'VE I'VE LEARNED IS IT TO TRY TO PICK A COLLEGE WHERE THEY HAVE AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT DEGREE PLANS THAT YOU'D LIKE AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU START WHEN YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY THAT ONE
YEAH SOMETHING TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE YOU GET TO CHANGE COLLEGES THEN YOU LOSE HOURS AND THEN YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT UH WOMEN ARE UH APPLICATIONS NOW  YEAH YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST GO TO COLLEGE WHEN THEY GET THEIR THEY FIND I GO- I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL
AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE THAT THEY WANT OTHER THAN THAT SO THEY ARE FACED THEM TO DO ALL THAT AND THAT CAN THAT CONTROL AS MUCH AS THE YEAR OUT OF YOUR DEGREE PLAN
BUT UH THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I INT- I ENCOUNTERED AND UH SO I I KNOW THAT  BUT YEAH SO AND THEN ALSO THE OTHER THING IS GOING TO ADJUST TO A JUNIOR COLLEGE
FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS TO GET ALL YOUR PLANNER COURSES YOUR MASTERS ENGLISH HISTORY GOVERNMENT ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT OUR TIME CONSUMING AND UH IN SOME OF COURSE THAT YOU CAN TAKE ON TELEVISION
AND GET THOSE OTHER WAY BEFORE YOU CAN START A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE COURSES ESPECIALLY ENGLISH IN HISTORY
WHAT LESS EXPENSIVE BUT ONLY THAT BUT A LOT OF THOSE COURSES THEY YOU THEY ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF YOU'RE STARTING OUT IN UH IN A FOUR YEAR DEGREE PLAN AT A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE
THEY'RE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND THEY GO A LITTLE FASTER AND IN JUNIOR COLLEGE AGO LITTLE SLOWER AND YOU DO LEARN YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE SELF-PACED AND UH
YEAH
WELL I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT DO GET AWAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SO FAR THAT YOU CAN GET TO THEM BUT AT LEAST
YOU KNOW A HUNDRED MILES OR OR EVEN TWO HUNDRED MILES WHERE YOU COULD AT LEAST GO DOWN THERE ON A LIKE SOMEONE IN ONE MONTH BASIS SO THEY CAN COME HOME
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL EXPENSIVE UH YOU KNOW A LOT TIME THEY CAN SHARE RIDES COMING BACK AND FORTH TO SAY YOU KNOW HAVE PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL AREA THAT LIVE NEAR THEM BUT UH
YEAH
YEAH NONE OF US DID THAT WE ALL STATE RIGHT CLOSE TO HOME COURSE I WAS MARRIED THE WHOLE TIME I WAS IN SCHOOL BUT UH BUT IT WAS UH IT WAS STILL A SITUATION WHERE MOM AND DAD WERE STILL AROUND IF YOU NEED THEM IN UH
YOU KNOW NOT THAT I COULD REALLY DEPEND ON THAT MUCH BUT THEY WERE STILL THERE AND WE'RE NOT FAR ENOUGH
UM-HUM
I GUESS PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS I KNOW THIS IS SOMEWHAT COLLEGES ARE ARE VERY MUCH
UH ENCOURAGING YOU KNOW THE KIDS JUST PLAYED IN ALL THE FOR CURRY SORORITIES ALL THE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
MUCH SO BECAUSE THEY UH THEY ARE MONEY MAKING THINGS AND THEY DO SUPPORT THEY DO HELP SUPPORT THE THE SCHOOL
BUT I PREFER CAUSES DON'T STRESS THAT IS THE MAJOR FOCUS
YEAH UH OH I'D RATHER GO TO THE SCHOOLS IS FOCUSED ON THE ON THE ACADEMIC PART OF IT
AND THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A KEY NOWADAYS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CALLS PROMOTE THE PARTY AND IN THE IN THE SORORITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND HE ONCE YOU GET HOOKED YOU CAN REALLY GET THE LOCKED UP MESSED UP YOUR GRADES SUFFER
THEY REALLY DO UH I GOT WRAPPED UP IN THAT COURSE I WAS IN ALL ATHLETICS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT YOU GOT SO TIME CONSUMING THAT GOT TO BE TO WEAR
I HAD DECIDED I WAS GOING TO JUST QUIT ALL THAT MESS UNTIL STUDY OR OR OR YOU KNOW BASICALLY JUST CAME THROUGH
UM LIKE WHAT I QUIT FOOT LIKE WITH FOOTBALL BECAUSE I JUST UH FIGURED THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT WELL MY GUN DO WITH THIS AFTER I GET OUT I'M NOT GONNA GO PRO FOOTBALL
UM NOT GOOD ENOUGH I FACE THE THE YOU KNOW FACE THAT UP FRONT SAY YOU KNOW I'D RATHER GET MY GRADES
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID I QUIT AND ONE THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT
NO NOT AT ALL  SO IT
UH BUT IT
BUT YOU KNOW YOU BUT A LOT OF KIDS GET HURT AND THEN THEY THEY WERE THEY CAN'T PLAY PRO BALL ANYWAY AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE EDUCATION THEY SHOULD HAVE WHETHER THEY GONNA DO
AND THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG THING RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'D THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS REALLY ATHLETICS THE LOT OF HER PLAYING BEFORE THEY EVEN CAN FINISHED COLLEGE
THEY'RE PLAYING PRO BALL I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE A PRE WRECKS AT THAT HAVE A DEGREE WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GRADE POINT AVERAGE BEFORE THEY EVEN ELIGIBLE FOR PRO BALL
BUT THEY DON'T THEY WON'T DO THAT
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I KNOW IT IT'S GETTING DOWN TO
GETTING DOWN TO GRADE SCHOOL NOW I THINK THEY REALLY NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU KNOW FROM STRESSING IN THE ATHLETIC SNAKES CREEK ACTIVITIES AND GET EVEN AT THE YOUNG AGE GET
GET THE POLITICS IN THE MONEY OUT THE ATHLETICS

ABLE TO MAKE A FRIENDS AND
THEY DON'T JUST HOLD ON TO THE OLD HOBBIES IN THE OLD ACTIVITIES THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE DENTURE US YOU KNOW ON

UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
NOW ME TOO
IN YOUR GRADES REALLY <UNK> OR
UH-HUH UH-HUH
AND AT THAT POINT DID YOU ALMOST SAY GEE I'M I HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS SCHOOL  TO DO THAT
HAVE YOU BEEN SORRY GO
THE THIRD TEXAS SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT IT'S SO
YEAH MY UH
YEAH
YEAH I AGREE BECAUSE
I WAS JUST READING A THING AND UM THIS IS ALSO BE SOMEWHAT BEEN THE READER'S DIGEST ABOUT UH
AFTER THE PRO ATHLETE SAID THAT UH
HAD GOTTEN ON THE DRUGS YOU KNOW IN IN VER- WEIGHTLESS ONCE IT DIDN'T HAVE A COFFIN JUSTICE
YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE ANOTHER DESTINATION REALIZE THAT THERE WAS ANY OTHER MONEY ANYWHERE EXCEPT YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR THAT INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE ATHLETIC ABILITIES AND
WELL  I THINK THAT WE HAD HERE JUST RECENTLY
AND I I'VE REALLY GOT GOT THE ARTICLE OUT I WAS MAD MYSELF BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON IT
THERE WAS A DOWN HERE IN THE PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM WHO HAD
WHO HAS SOME PREMISE THAT OUR GRADES IN THE METROPLEX IN IN YOU KNOW
SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW OR THING AND AND UH RICHARDSON LIKE SILENCE IN PLANO I THINK WELL HE'S TARGET ONES ARE INFLATED ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED GREAT
AND HE FELT LIKE THOSE KIDS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GONE IN TWO COLLEGE SITUATIONS WE'RE NOT UH
THE BASIC QUESTION IS TOO MUCH UH
AND
I DON'T KNOW MY MY PIN YEAH I GUESS HERE NORTH CAROLINA THEY ANNOUNCED THAT MAY SECOND WAS THE UH TAX DAY THAT'S WHEN YOU EVERYTHING YOU EARN SO FAR IS GONE TO TAXES
THE REST OF THE YEARS YOURS
THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF YOUR INCOME UH
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO CAME OVER THAT FIGURE BUT I THINK IT REALLY COMES OUT TO BE MORE THAN THE THIRD
BUT UH I AND I DON'T KNOW I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TO LIKE SELECTIVE
APPROVAL ALMOST LIKE UNITED WAY CAMPAIGN WHERE YOU PRETTY WITH MOST OF THE AGENCIES BUT UH DON'T AGREE WITH SOME OF THEM
AND
I THINK THAT WE COULD HAVE LESS TAX
ABOUT CUTTING OUT SOME OF THE
THE UH
PROGRAMS THAT WE SUPPORT
BUT OVERALL I GUESS WE'RE PRETTY FORTUNATE NATURE NATION AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF TAXES WITH IT HOW DO YOU FEEL
YEAH I'VE DONE SOME BUSINESS OVERSEAS AND AND LATIN AMERICA AND COURSE KNOW ABOUT THE YEAR ABOUT SWEDEN WITH THEIR
A SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT YOU DON'T HEAR WHAT THE COST IS THE SAME IN YOUR IN PRISON AND ALL THE NATIONS MUCH HIGHER TAX RATES
BUT
OH YES
OH YES THAT THAT'S THE UH THE TYPE OF THING THAT REALLY IRRITATES ME WHERE THEY CAN GET SIGNIFICANT INCREASES WHEN EVERYONE ELSE'S PLACING LAYOFFS OR OR CUT BACK SO
UH EQUATING IT TO A PERSONAL INCOME SITUATION
AND YET IT'S ALMOST AUTOMATIC LARGE HIDDEN AND
UH I THINK THEY NEED TO LIKE THE SAME BULLET THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS TO
THE ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS UH I HAVE RECENTLY IS
CENTERS ON SUCH THINGS AS THAT BUT THEN QUILT SO VESTED GEORGIA PLAY GOLF
AND I REALIZE THAT CONSTANT COMMUNICATIONS NECESSARY
ESPECIALLY WHEN BUSH HAS IS UH
HEART RESOLVING PROBLEMS THIS WEEKEND BUT
WE CAN ALWAYS AND JETS FOUR SOMEONE I THINK THEY'RE OUT OF POCKET
OTHER THAN ACCEPTING IS THE NORM FOR MUCH GOLF AND
SO THAT'S FROM ABOUT SELECTING A SOME THINGS I THINK WE WERE DOING EXTREMELY WRONG COULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY
BUT OTHER THINGS SO
LIKE I ENJOY SEEING MONEY SPENT ALL THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON UH THINGS ONE OF THE NICEST NATIONAL TREASURES AND UH LET'S SEE
KIDS OF THE ANY BACKGROUND ROAMING THROUGH DANCING SUCH GREAT COLLECTIONS
BUT
THEN WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE FOREIGN AID THAT WE GIVE AWAY
THAT BOTHERS ME A LOT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WHEN IT'S YOU SAID THE UH BUREAUCRACY GETS OUT OF HAND REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU VOTE FOR
THE BUREAUCRACY CONTINUES TO
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK IT'S WEIGHT <UNK>
INTO WAY OUT OF HAND I'M ALWAYS TURNING INTO ISOLATIONIST
WHICH IS NOT NOT A GOOD ATTITUDE AND AND THE GLOBAL A COMMUNICATIONS EVERYTHING WE HAVE THIS THESE DAYS BUT IT'S A MATTER OF UH
I HATE TO SEE MONEY THROWN AWAY AND THAT'S WHEREVER I EQUATE TOO SO OR PART MAPLES
AND
I AGREE I THINK THAT'S
I HAVE SOME PROBLEM WITH SOCIAL PROGRAMS AT HOME IN TERMS OF MAKING IT TOO CONVENIENT TO BE ON ON WELFARE
OH YEAH YEAH BUT I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL TO STAY ON WELFARE THEN AS GOOD A JOB YOU GOT A BASIC CONCEPT PROBLEM
YEAH
BUT I- I THINK UH IF WE'RE GOING TO WASTE MONEY I'D ALMOST A RATHER SEARS WASTED HOLDING
THEN OVERSEAS TO AND THEN THERE'S SOME UNUSUAL
THINGS WHICH CAN A CAR IN THE FAR IN A UH
BY STROKE OF TEN I THINK OUR PRESENTS CAN FORGIVE FAR AND THAT AND THAT'S A LOT OF POWER VESTED ONE
ONE PERSON IN OUR SYSTEM OF OF
GOVERNMENTS
AND I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND YOU AND I ARE PAYING FOR
BUT JIMMY COMES BACK A LOT TO THE SAME THING THAT YOU SAID A NATIONAL YOU'VE BEEN OVERSEAS INSANE
OTHER PLACES
AND I GUESS WE STILL FORTUNATE BUT I THINK WE'RE JUST I JUST WANTS TO BE SMART OR
THAN WE ARE
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH OKLAHOMA JUST VOTED FOR STATE LEGISLATORS OF ONE TERM
NO THE CITY
BUT IT WAS ONE GERMAN TO TURN
FIXED
UH INCOME AND SHE KNOWS THAT CAN BE REALLY RELUCTANT AFTER
UH THEY MAY BE THE SECOND TERM
FEDERAL
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT TAKES AWAY THE ISSUE OF OF A LOT OF THE UH SPECIAL LOBBYIST GROUPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
CREATING THE INCOME AND THE
WELL
INVINCIBILITY INFANTS ABILITY
BUT
THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THAT UH THAT WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD ONES AND I HATE TO SEE THEM LEAGUE
BUT I- I GUESS IT'S HARD TO TO REALLY UH
IDENTIFY WHICH IS A GOOD WHICH OF THE BED
THE ELECTORATE SEEMS TO BE PUT THEM ALL THAT CAN'T
I THOUGHT THIS LAST SELECTION WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT IT IT TURNED OUT IT REALLY WASN'T
UM-HUM
UH IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE NON ELECTED BUREAUC- BUREAUCRATS EITHER THAT'S
THAT'S AN ISSUE I THINK IT REALLY GETS INTO IT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S IT
IN THE SAME POSITION AND REALLY DON'T GIVE THOSE WHO WHO GET SELECTED
THEY STILL KIND OF RUN THE SHOW AND AND SO THE BALL THE ROADBLOCKS AND THEY
THE UH
AROUND THIS REGULATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
BUT IT'S UH
IT'S OUR SYSTEM I THINK NOW FBI HOW TO REALLY MANAGE IT WELL
UM-HUM UM-HUM AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
WELL
YEAH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE GET THE
FROM CONGRESS THE THE FACTS AS AS FAR AS THE UH
KNOWLEDGE TO TO LIKE THE RIGHT PEOPLE
I HAVE I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM FED REGISTER PRESENTS
UH YOU CAN HAVE ALWAYS PUT ANYTHING IN THERE YOU WANT TO
NO IT'S NOT A REGISTERED WHAT'S THE UH THE CONGRESSIONAL RIGHT
UH SOMEONE CAN PUT IN THE INFORMATION RESTAURANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SHOW THAT THEY SUPPORTED SOMETHING OR
YEAH
AND
OH I'VE I'VE LIVED OVERSEAS KNOWS WHAT IN THE ARMY AND I SEE WHAT KIND OF TEXAS THAT THEY IN OTHER COUNTRIES
IT JUST SEEMS IF
SOMETIMES I'VE BEEN FALLING POLITICS WHICH WAS IS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE REALLY GOT INTERESTED IN POLITICS KEEPING UP WITH IT
IT JUST SEEMS TO THAT TIME THE BUREAUCRATIC MACHINE TO JUST GOTTEN SO OUT OF CONTROL
A A SCREEN ABOUT THAT
THEY ARE THE UH POLITICIANS SCREAMING ABOUT THEY'RE GONNA TRY NOT RAISE TAXES THEY PUT IN A RAISE THEMSELVES EVERY YEAR
I I HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE CONSTANT SUPPORTED UNDERSTAND GOING IN THE COUNTRY THEY SAID NATURAL DISASTERS
AND GOING AND GIVING RELIEF AID THAT WAY
BUT PAYING FOR THEIR TO THESE COUNTRIES TO RUN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT
I'VE I'VE GOT A BIG THING UP WITH THAT
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY JUST THEY WERE HELPING THIS COUNTRY OR HELPING THAT COUNTRY OUT
WE'RE GONNA BE BETTER SPENT HELPING HERE AT AT AT HOME I
THAT'S THAT'S ABOUT AS BAD BUDGETING ITSELF ON THE THE TWO THAT ENTIRE THING REVISED
SO I'VE GOT A CHANGE
INJURED DRASTICALLY
WE'VE GOT
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE THE PEOPLE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE GOT IT
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO MAKE A CHANGE
BUT AS LONG AS YOU GOT CAREER POLITICIANS TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE YEARS IN WASHINGTON
PLAYING POWER BROKER AND I COULD DO ANYTHING TO TO TAP OUT THE WELL
THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN NOT ONLY IN ALL THE STATES BUT IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE STU-
TWO TERMS THEY'VE GOT TO SIT OUT ONE
MISSING A LOT
THE THING ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY UP THERE DOING WHAT THEY WERE LIKE TO TO DO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE THAT OFFICE AND UH IF THEY HAVE TO SIT OUT A TERM FIND THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES
EITHER THEY COULD PASSED IT THE LOBBYIST OR IN
WORKING WITH DINNER PARTY AT AT THE STATE OR NATIONAL LEVEL TO GET THINGS OF THAT
THAT'S NOT SO SLOW THEM DOWN AT ALL
THEY COMPARED TO THE OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITHOUT A DOUBT WE'VE GOT PROBABLY THE BEST SYSTEM BUT JUST NEEDS AND FIND CITY
WELL QUESTION IS WHO WHO'S READY DID BUT THEN ON THE FIRST RICH INSIDE THE FIRST BALL
TRYING TO GET
THE UM
POLITICIANS ACTUALLY TRUTHFULLY
REPORT WHAT THEY DID GO FOR WHAT THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR AT THEIR DESK
IT ALL THE IS GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO
THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY OF THEM
AT ANY GIVEN TIME KEEPING THE WASHINGTON
OKAY UM I THINK THEY DIDN'T ESTATE EVERYONE NEEDS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPOSURE TO COMMUNITY SERVICE
BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE AND I'M I'M THINKING OF THE COMMUNITY TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE IN JAIL NOW I THINK THAT MAYBE IF IF
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THEY GOT EXPOSED TO A COMMUNITY GOT EXPOSED TO WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DID THEY WOULD NOT IT'S DONE BECAUSE THEY WERE BUMPING UNDERSTAND PEOPLE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND HELPING PEOPLE MORE THAN THE STAND THE PLIGHT OF PEOPLE
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM I WOULD THINK THAT FOUR LIKE PEOPLE BUT IT JUST FILTHY FILTHY RATES
I THINK THEY'VE THEY'VE WOULD BENEFIT ALSO INTO A COMMUNITY SERVICE SO THAT THEY
TENNESSEE AND I'M I'M SPEAKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT LIKE BOURNE RATES
AND THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW AND I THINK A COMMUNITY SERVICE WOULD HELP THEM UM JUST GET A FEEL OF WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE HOW WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE TO WORK IN IN UM UM
ON ON THE SOUP KITCHEN OR SOMETHING AND THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW WOULD PEOPLE LIVE
AND UH YOU KNOW I I'M THE SAME NO IF POOR IF
POUR WORK PEOPLE  UH WORKING DID SERVE THE COMMUNITY

IN THIS IN SOME KIND OF SERVICE OR FOR THE COMMUNITY OR SOMETHING THEY CAN SEE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T SEE BUT YOU DON'T YOU CAN'T NO WHICH YOU DON'T SEE
YOU KNOW SO THEN YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT OTHER PEOPLE POOR

THE MOOD FOR CHANGE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE LEFT TO HAPPEN AND THAT THEY'RE STILL <UNK> COMMUNISM WHICH IS A POUND MAINLY OPPOSED TO DEMOCRACY AND THEY'RE STILL MISSILES
I- I- I- I
RIGHT
YES
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT WELL I GUESS THAT THAT THAT BRINGS UP THE QUESTION IS I- IT THEY'RE I THINK IN IN THE LONG TERM WE COULD SEE A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE IN HE HE INCREDIBLE SOLD WARS
AND THAT THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTRY BREAKS DOWN IN THE STRIFE TOO MUCH MUCH DEATH
BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS BE- BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER UH EVENTS THAT COULD HAPPEN INCLUDING UH RESURGENCE OF COMMUNISM WITH UM VIOLENT UH BACKLASH AGAINST DEMOCRACY
WHICH IS WHERE WE COULD BEING THREATENED I GUESS IT'S A
UM START YOU YOU'RE RIGHT I ME- I MEAN TO SAY CAPITALISM
YES THAT'S TRUE THAT UH
BUT NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH FROM THE SOVIET UNION'S PEOPLE'S POINT OF VIEW
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT UM-HUM
I SEE
I- I AGREE WITH THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THE UH MORE ONE THING THAT'S CUT OF INTEREST IT IS IF THIS OF YOU MEAN STRUCTURE DOES BREAK DOWN IN THERE IS A WAR AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WARS OR DURING THE CIVIL WARS AND WHO WAS HANDS WILL THOSE MISSILES BE
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF TIME UH SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE MANY MANY REPUBLICS
RIGHT ALMOST THE TERRORISTIC THOUGHT
COME HELP US OR WELL BONNY
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
I KNOW IT'S ALMOST AMAZING HOW LITTLE YOU HEAR ABOUT DAN QUAYLE AND WHEN YOU DO IT'S USUALLY TOTALLY
YEAH YEAH HE HE STILL WANT TO SEND PEOPLE TO MARS
THE GUYS IS <UNK> LAME THIS AT LEAST
OH WELL SO THAT'S UH  IT'S GONNA BE REAL INTERESTING IS IF WHEN THEY HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
IF BUSH IS GONNA RUN LOOK WELL AGAIN
OR HE'S BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WHICH I THINK WOULD BE IT WOULD IF THAT'S IF THIS PRESIDENT'S FOR THAT WHERE UH THERE'S THE SAME PRESIDENT A DIFFERENT VICE PRESIDENT
IS THERE
ABOUT WITHOUT SOMETHING LIKE DEATH OR IMPEACHMENT
UH I I CAN RECALL
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I GUESS IN THE LAST SELECTIONS IT WAS IT WAS THE LESSER OF SEVERAL EVILS BUT FROM THE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
OH WELL SO LET'S SEE BACK TO THE THAT KEY ISSUE UH UM
FIGURE THE OTHER PART OF COURSE WAS WHAT WOULD IT UH WHAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN TO CONVINCE ME
AND I'D SAY IT SEEMS TO ME UH THAT THE MISSILES ARE THE THREAT
AND SO WHAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN IS A COMPLETE DISARMAMENT
UH I- AND THAT'S I YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN BUT HIGH DOWN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS
I DON'T KNOW
PERSONALLY I I RE- AS I SAID I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE IT HAPPENED I JUST
UM-HUM
OH UNDER THIS
I SEE UNDER THE FEAR THAT THAT OF MOSCOW GETS SPONSORS THAT'S A GOOD POINT THAT'S VERY GOOD POINT IN FACT
RIGHT
YES THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD GRADE POINT
OKAY WELL SO
YEAH THERE'S NOT ANY TOO BREAD TODAY BUT
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE I GUESS I'M I'M CONFUSED UH BY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES AND SO MUCH FOR EVEN RECOGNIZE THE UNITED STATES IS AMAZING TO BE THREATENED UM
THE UH I GUESS THE MAIN ISSUE IS IS THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS BREATHING UP AND IT WAS ON INTERNAL PROBLEMS
UH A- A- AND IT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE NICE IF THE VARIOUS UH REPUBLICS SECEDED
OH THE OTHER HAND I ALSO THINK WOULD BE VERY NICE OF THE VARIOUS STATES IN OUR UNION SECEDED UP BUT THAT'S THE SI- THE POOR  UM
AND IT'S MUCH LESS THAN CLEAR TO ME THAT UH THE MILITARY POWER ON THERE'S GONNA BE ANYTHING LEFT UH GIVEN IS IT LIKE THAT HAPPENS
UH THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS KEEPING AROUND PEOPLE HAPPY DO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW NUKING OTHER PEOPLE ARE BOTHERING THEM
UM-HUM
I GUESS SOME GOOD WHITE IS WISE COMMUNISM ANTIETHICAL BLUE DEMOCRACY I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S A TOUGH TICKLED CAPITALISM
OKAY
UH ARE A BUT WE'VE ALREADY GOT A LOT OF THE LA CAPITALISM IN THIS COUNTRY
UM
THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE
UH BUT CERTAINLY THE LATEST RUMORS IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW BOTH SOAK THE RICH MORE SO WE CAN SPREAD OUT THE MONEY
YEAH THAT'S CERTAINLY COMMUNISM AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
OH
SO HAVE YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR IT
OH OF THEM
AND THIS IS SO I GUESS SINCE THE PRIMARY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A MILITARY PROBLEM THAT'S CLOSE REGULARLY AND IF THEY'RE SMART THEY'RE JUST A WET US HAD TOWARD COMMUNISM ON AROUND VERY MERRY WAY
YEAH THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT SORT OF THING BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY GET MORE OUT OF IT THAT WAY
UM
SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I DON'T CONSIDER THEM A THREAT
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET A SOMEHOW IMPORT COMMUNISM TO US
UM-HUM
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S THAT CAN BE AFRAID THEY THOUGHT
OH
YEP YEP
YEAH
UM
COURSE IT'S LIKE THE WAY WHEN FRIENDS BUT YEAH I MEAN I- I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE WHOLE THIRD WORLD ISSUE UH WITH HIM
WITH UH THE SOVIET UNION HAVING UH SUPPORT IT'S UH A RACKET
UH PREVIOUSLY AND AND SO THERE'S THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF POLITICAL POSSIBILITIES UM
BUT YOU KNOW JUST JUST TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE I MEAN GEORGE BUSH WAS RECENTLY IN THE HOSPITAL
AND SO FOR A MOMENT DAN QUAYLE MIGHT'VE BEEN
YEAH
IT'S A JOKE
RIGHT
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
OH I THINK SO I CAN'T THINK OFFHAND <UNK>
YEAH
I MAY JUST CAN'T IMAGINE VOTING FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS QUAYLE ON THEIR TICKET
RIGHT YOU KNOW HE WAS BASICALLY I KNOW AND SO I MEAN YOU JUST LIKE OKAY SO IT'S IT'S ABORTION SOMEBODY ELSE
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YOU DON'T THINK SO
I JUST I CAN'T SEE TO MAINTAIN A MISSILE BASES IN FACT I THINK OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT STARTS RETREATING YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THESE CIVIL WARS AND STUFF BUT THE FIRST THING THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS CLOSED DOWN THE MUSCLE BASES AND THE REPUBLICS
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT I DON'T WANT THEM TO FALL INTO THE REPUBLICS FANS
MIGHT BE USED AGAINST <UNK> THAT'S RIGHT
AND SO I THINK JUST FROM THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SEWN LIMITED AMOUNT OF DISARM IT'LL STILL BE REPUBLICS WITH THE MISSILES THE ONES THAT ARE UNDER THE FIRMER CONTROL OF THE OF THE SOVIETS
UH BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW LIKE WITH THE WAY AND STUFF I THINK WOULD LOSE THERE'S

SURE UH-HUH
YEAH I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT EITHER THE THE ROBIN HOOD APPROACH FOR THE RICH <UNK> FOUR
NO I DON'T PEOPLE MOVE TO THE SUBURBS TO RICHARDSON AND PLANO UP A MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE LEVEL EDUCATION SUFFERED
YEAH WELL IT COSTS UH SO MUCH IN TAXES HERE AND UH EVEN IF THEY DO GIVE MONEY TO THE POOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO LOWER MY TAXES AT ALL
YEAH
SURE
WELL THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING UM
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE TALENT AS FAR AS SCHOOL TEACHING UH GOES
YEAH
WELL I THINK IT IS TOO UH EVERY
NO I WENT TO SCHOOL WISCONSIN
RIGHT
UH-HUH WELL WE QUALIFIED TEACHERS NO MATTER WHETHER TEACHING IN THE INNER CITY OF THE SUBURBS
OF THE TROUBLE IS THAT THE SUBURBS ARE UH IT'LL TO PAY MORE THAT'S GOING TO ATTRACT THE THE BETTER OF TEACHERS
SURE AND THE COST MORE TAX MONEY TOO SO
COULD VERY WELL THEY UH THERE IS A DEFINITE RACIAL SPLIT HERE
WELL I WAS IN A RURAL AREA IN WISCONSIN AND UH WE HAD A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS GREAT I THINK THE CURRICULUM WAS VERY DEFICIENT TO PREPARE PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE
BUT UH THE THE RACIAL MIX OF UH STUDENTS IN MY AREA WAS ENTIRELY WHITE WE HAD UH NO MINORITIES AT ALL
HOCK IT WAS INTERESTING
HUH
RIGHT
SURE
RIGHT WELL THE GOOD SCHOOL DISTRICTS HERE DO HAVE HONORS PROGRAMS UM THEY DO ENCOURAGE THAT AMONG STUDENTS WHO WERE UH PREPARED TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT UH IT THAT BRINGS UP A WHOLE OF BUNCH OF OTHER PROBLEMS UM
SURE
ALL RIGHT I HADN'T HEARD THAT YEAH
THAT'S INTERESTING I KNOW SOME PEOPLE AT WORK TO UH HAVE UH CHILDREN IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ALL THEY DO SEND THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCRUB SCHOOL
UH MY SON TO US A MARKS I THINK WE'RE THE TOYOTA
YEAH UM-HUM
WELL HE SAID ABOUT SIX HUNDRED A MONTH AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THEIR PERSONAL EXPENSE
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UH COLLEGE A LITTLE EASIER
SURE I THINK I THINK OUT OF PROGRAMS ARE GOOD IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS BUT UH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS TOGETHER THE KIDS THAT ARE IN THOSE PROGRAMS GET HER REST BY THEIR PEERS
FOR DOING TOO WELL
AND THAT DISCOURAGES THEM FROM DOING WELL
SO UH
YEAH
UH-HUH
THEY'RE A LOT OF GRASS THEIR OWN PACE PLAN
RIGHT
NOW
I CAN RELATE TO PART OF THAT UH IN MY HIGH SCHOOL UH SAY JUST FOR FOR EXAMPLE IN MY MATH COURSES UH I WAS NOT RIGHT ABOUT THIS AT ALL I WAS SO FAR EVERYBODY ELSE I'D HAVE TO GO TO CLASS
AND I GOT TO SIT BY MYSELF AN EMPTY ROOM WELL EVERYBODY ELSE WAS AND CLASS TAKING ALGEBRA A WORKING MOM PACE
SURE
YEAH
YEAH I'M SURE THE DEFICIT
YEAH
WELL I KNOW PEOPLE UH WELL HAVING KIDS EITHER BUT UH FOR I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD THE NEIGHBORS SOMETIMES
WE HAD KIDS AND WHENEVER THE FATHER WAS TRAVELING AWAY IN BUSINESS OR THEY HAD FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THEIR KIDS UH THERE WERE IT WAS DEFINITELY NOTICED AT THEIR PERFORMANCES SCHOOL
YEAH I'VE GOT SO BAD WITH WITH THIS ONE KID THAT UH THE THE SCHOOL UH CALLED THE PARENTS OF TESTS OR ANY PROBLEMS GOING ON
IS IS PERFORMANCES SCHOOL A DEGREE IN IT SO MUCH
UH I BELIEVE IN THAT
OH YEAH
RIGHT WELL I REMEMBER AS A KID UH THEY HAD PTA PARENT TEACHER UH ASSOCIATION MEETINGS ALL THE TIME
AND UH MY PARENTS ALWAYS WANT TO THOSE UH
I'M I DON'T KNOW
SURE
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL THE THE DROPOUT RATE IS SO HIGH DALLAS FORT WORTH A US IS THAT I THINK IT'S UH THIRTY EIGHT
UM WELL WE DON'T HAVE CHILDREN BUT UM FROM WHAT APPEARS TELL IT UM MOST OF THEM DO ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE WAY THE DALLAS PUBLIC MUCH AND GET SPECIFIC WHERE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS RIGHT HERE
UM THEY JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THE UM THE QUALITY OF THE TEACHERS AND THE QUALITY OF THE YEAR CURRICULUM AND ACTUALLY SEND THEM TO UH THE SUBURBAN AREAS I I GUESS THE CAFETERIA PLANO
UM AND I THINK ONE THING THAT THE STATES DOING RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE REFUNDING I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR IT'S NOT A
YEAH
YEAH I W- THAT BASIC REASON YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT
YEAH
YEAH THEY ARE PAYING FOR IT I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW W- W- UM AND WE USED TO LIVE IN GARLAND AND ALL LOT OF PEOPLE THERE SENT THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE UM THEY JUST THE MICHAEL GOING ON
UM-HUM
I KNOW AND I MEAN I LOOK AT HIGH SCHOOLS LIKE UM WHAT WAS WHAT RICHARDSON J J PURIFY SCHOOL THAT JUST WANNA NATIONAL ACADEMIC SOME KIND OF UM
UH CHAMPIONSHIP OR TOURNAMENT THAT THEY HAD FOR ACADEMIC AND BE- RICHARDSON'S ONE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT WOULD BE HIT BY TAKING AWAY FROM THEM
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO SAY IT THE ROBIN HOOD UM APPROACH
YEAH
YOU KNOW I USED TO WORK AT UP AND ROSS PEROT YOU KNOW THE BIG JOKE SOMETIMES UM ABOUT HIM BUT THE ONE THING HE DID A FEW YEARS BACK IN TESTING THE COMPETENCY OF THE UH FACULTY
I STILL THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN TEXAS
AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN CHICAGO SO I CAN TELL YOU IT'S PROBABLY THE SAME TYPE OF THING THAT UM I HAD A REALLY GOOD EDUCATION BUT IT WASN'T WHERE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WAS AN INNER CITY BUT AT THE FACULTY WAS VERY GOOD
AND I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT
UM-HUM
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE I MEAN I'D GO WELL BE COME THROUGH THE MALLS
YEAH I MEAN IT'S YET  I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF UM THE INFLUX OF MINORITY UM IN TERMS OF THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PLEASE ALL PEOPLE IN THERE NOW PLEASING ANYBODY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT REALLY
YEAH I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EXACTLY IT OR NOT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE UM
WELL I DON'T KNOW SCHOOLS IN WISCONSIN TOO I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAN ABOUT SCHOOLS OF NORTH COMPARED DOWN HERE
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE DOWN HERE THAT UNLESS YOU'RE IN SUBURBAN IN AT THEIR S A T SCORES THEIR READING COMPREHENSION LEVELS THEY'RE JUST NOT AS HIGH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
AND I WAS I'M I WAS COMPLETELY YEAH UM HISPANIC IN TERMS OF POOR REEK AND UM CAUCASIAN AND EASTERN EUROPEAN
UH-HUH
IT WAS VERY O'CLOCK THICK UM BUT THE TEACHERS WERE WHAT THAT UM WE DID THINGS LIKE PHILOSOPHY IN JOURNALISM I MEAN
BUT THERE WAS ONE DAY YOU KNOW REAL FOR PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF THAT NEW THEY WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN NEW THEY WANTED TO UM GO IF REALLY COMPETITIVE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IT WASN'T WHAT I WOULD CALL A YEAH CAREER IN THE ACADEMIC
PAT CRAP WORK FOR A POUND FOR COLLEGE PREP UM AS OPPOSED TO SUBURBAN SCHOOLS LIKE EVANSTON ILLINOIS WHICH HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST YOU KNOW
I SEE BODIES IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT AND UH MONEY BASE TO GO WITH THAT UM
I DON'T KNOW I JUST LOOK AT HIGH SCHOOLS LIKE PLANO EAST AND WEST THAN THE ONES IN RICHARDSON I THINK WELL I WAS IN THE CHILD THERE
UM-HUM

UM AND WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THEY'RE PAYING YOU JUST
OH MY GOODNESS
YEAH TWELVE YEARS AND YOU HAD MORE THAN ONE CHILD TO THAT AND YOU SAY OH MY GOODNESS YEAH I

THEY ACTUALLY THEY CALL THEM EXTERNSHIPS BUT THEY ACTUALLY THE CHILD IT'S UM IT THEY GO BY FORMS THEY'LL GO BY GRADE AND I GUESS I GUESS
MOBY DICK WITH ONE OF OUR REALLY HIGH SCHOOL NINE TENTH GRADE THEY CALLED A TEMPER LOAN FORM UM
THEY ACTUALLY ARE FORCED TO TAKE TIME OFF AND PICKING AREA STUDY IT'S PROCTORED IT'S YOU KNOW REGULATED NO THAT'S SORT OF THING UM BUT THEY ACTUALLY GUARD SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE LIBRARY AND DO THEIR OWN THING ON A PARTICULAR SUBJECT AND DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS
YOU HAVE TO BE ACADEMIC BUT THEY C- IT'S FREEDOM OF THEIR CHOOSING
RIGHT IN THAT ONE JUST FOR THAT ONE PARTICULAR SEMESTER QUARTER OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THAT ONE CORE THEY'D STUDYING IT WOULD BE

THEY'LL BE ABUSED YOU KNOW HORROR STORIES ALL THE TIME
BUT IF YOU CAN YEAH

IS WHAT I GET TO COME IN FROM ELDERLY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENED TOO
AND THE ELDERLY PEOPLE THAT I IN THAT ARE STILL HANGING ON TO THEIR HOMES THAT IS THERE GREATEST FEAR IS TO BE PUT INTO A UH A CARE FACILITY RATHER THAN THEIR FAMILIES TAKING THEM THEN
BECAUSE THE FAMILIES AND SEEM TO NEGLECT VISITING THEM
BUT IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO A CARE FACILITY LIKE THAT I THINK THAT CARE FACILITY HAS TO BE FAIRLY INVESTIGATED AS FAR AS THE UH MEDICAL UM
YOU TELL YOU WEIGH S- AND UH WHAT KIND OF CREDENTIALS TO TO MEDICAL PEOPLE HOLD UH AFTER QUALIFY UM WHAT TYPE OF RECREATION TO THEY HAVE FOR THEM UM THEIR FOOD UM SITUATION
UM
THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT THAT THERE IS IT PARADE IN JURY UM

I- I DON'T THINK THAT MANY BY THE BUILDER THAT WE HAVE THAT BUILT THIS HOUSE SO WE WE WERE NOT THE FIRST PEOPLE THE FIRST HONORS I THINK WE'RE THE THIRD ROLLERS ARE BUILT BY THE ARCHITECTS FOR ITSELF
WE NEVER MOVED INTO IT WHO SOLD IT TO A COUPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA THAT HOMES EVER NEEDED UPKEEP
OH YEAH CAULKING WINDOWS WAS A GREAT M- TO THEM YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW THEY JUST WATCH THE WATER POUR IT ON THE CARPET BUT FISH A REEF NEAR HOMES THAT MEANS ANYTHING DIDN'T REALLY NEAT THING TO BE SURPRISED LIKE THAT

I THINK WITH
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND THEY DON'T JUST SQUARE FOOT OFF BREAK IN AT ON THE CRINK OR SO WHICH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED I THINK IT WAS SIXTY AT
I SEE
WELL I THINK IF IT WAS A HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF UH
NO IT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE OF THE HOUSES AROUND THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AND IT WAS NEVER SELL FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS JUST NEVER
NOW MAYBE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT IT WAS SOLD FOR A BRAND NEW
OR WHAT IS THAT PRETTY MUCH WHAT WAS BUILT FOUR IT'S COME OFF A LOT OF NICE THINGS AND I PAY YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LONG TIME IF EVER WIN NICE THINGS AND REALLY QUALITY CONSTRUCTION ALL THE OTHER DISHING AMENITIES

DESIRABLE IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE GO FOR SQUARE FOOTAGE ONLY NOW

DON'T WANT SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME JUST BECAUSE IT'S BACK THERE AND I ALWAYS QUESTIONS QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND I- I DON'T THINK THEY NEED MORE THAN TWELVE NAILS P- HOUSE
WHEN YOU WATCH THEM GO UP YOU JUST A SECOND FALL OVER A TEACUP SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY DAYS TO FEED THE HOUSE
UM-HUM
SO WE'VE GOT
THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DECKING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT SLOPES WAY BACK DOWN AND AND THE HOUSES BUILT AROUND THE TREES
IT WAS A IT DECKING THAT INCORPORATE SOME LARGE SUNNY AREAS FOR THE TREES TALK ABOUT THIS REAL REAL SHADY THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THAT
THAT REALLY UH IMMEDIATELY PAY BACKGROUND RETURNS BUT BUT IT'S A SCARY HOMES DOWN HERE
WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM IN YOU KNOW I COME DOWN AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW THERE USED TO IT AT THE VIRGINIA AREA THAT'S CAUGHT DC I CAN'T THINK OF DOWN HERE AND AND THIS HOUSE IS THAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO THE THE COLONIAL LOOKS LIKE WHAT
RIGHT AND THE IDEA OF EVER OWNING ANYTHING THAT HAS FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IT'S FOR LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT WHAT THEIR ACT WHAT HE IS THAT THEY GOT OUT OF THE ONLY THEIR HOUSES BUT IT WAS NICE TALKING
WELL ONE OF PEOPLE I WAS LIVING BACK THERE WAS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS HIS AIR-CONDITIONING BILL PER MONTH THE LAST SUMMER WAS AN ACCESS TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH AND I THOUGHT

UH
AND YET YOU KNOW BUT A- THEY THEY SHOW VERY WELL AND THEY SURE VERY WELL UNLESS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WE LIVED IN LA HOUSES AROUND HERE OR LESS
OR LOOK AT A LOT OF HOUSES AROUND HERE
I THINK THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT I LIKE I LIKE THIS AREA AND EVERYTHING THAT I COULD SEE THAT'S IT
IF I YEAH I THINK IF WE HAD A SO NOW WE GET COME CLOSE TO BREAK IT W-
I YOU KNOW
UH WE ARE TOO DISCUSS AIR POLLUTION THAN UH WHAT WE THINK TO CAUSES ARE
AND I PROBABLY WOULDN'T UH TARGET UH INDUSTRY IS BEING NUMBER ONE POLLUTER
WELL THE ECHOES IN IN YES YEAH
RIGHT BECAUSE UH THERE'S A LOT OF COMMERCIAL HUGO'S HELP THEIR ESPECIALLY THOSE THE BIG RIGS LIKE THE BUSES AND UM
THE BIG UH EIGHTEEN WHEELERS AND SO FORTH
I THINK THEY WOULD GENERATE PROBABLY UH WELL ONE OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY GENERATE ENOUGH OR THREE CARS
BUT THAT'S NOT I- AND I THINK IT CAN BE RESOLVED IF UH IF THEY REALLY LET GO WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY HAVE THAT UH AT THEIR HAND AND THEY HAVEN'T FOR AT LEAST IT YET
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HOLD BACK UM BECAUSE OF UH
OH PRIORITIES THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW AND UH IT  YOU HAVE SOME SURE AND
OKAY  YOU HAVE DO YOU WATCH CHILDREN ARE DO YOU
UH-HUH
WELL THAT'S INTERESTING
UM
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
BUT I GET OUT OF THAT PHASE
SO IN ENOUGH
YEAH
OH YES
UM-HUM
UH-HUH SURE
UM-HUM  WELL I KNOW UH UH I- IN MICHIGAN UH THE WAY THEY USED TO TAKE CARE OF THE TRASH IS THEY WOULD INCINERATE IT AND THE FUMES FROM THE INSPIRATION WAS A TERRIBLE POLLUTE INTO THE AIR
AND UM COURSE NOW
NO AND WHEN THEY BE AN YOU BURY AND THAT'S NOT GONE EITHER BECAUSE IT HAS UNTOLD RAMIFICATIONS
AND UH
AND IT GETS INTO INTO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHICH IS UH THE THE MOST IMPORTANT UM
RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE THIS PEOPLE AND THEIR IN THEIR DESTROYING IF THEY REALLY ARE
SO I THINK THE C- CRUCIAL YOU'VE ALSO UH FAITHFULLY
SO THEY SAY
YES THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
AND WE NEED EXPERT COOPERATION
YEAH IT'S OCCASION OF THE
EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE IS PRIMARILY I WOULD THINK
AND UH AND WERE HARD TO TEACH
WHERE ARE TO TEACH
ABSOLUTELY YEAH
UM-HUM
ABSOLUTELY YES UH OF COURSE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ACCELERATED BECAUSE O- OF THE CRITICAL NATURE OF IT
THE THE LEARNING OF IT AND UH JUST TO UM THINK IT THAT WAY WE HAVE TO BE IN THAT THOUGHT PATTERN IN ABLE TO UM MOTIVATE OURSELVES TO UM
UH DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE ATMOSPHERE
UM
I THINK WE'RE ALL CONTRIBUTORS I MEAN EVERY HUMAN BEING THAT LIVES IS A CONTRIBUTOR TO POLLUTION SO
WE JUST
UM-HUM
WELL HOPEFULLY IT CAN BE RESOLVED WAS IN A SHORTER TIME FRAME THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT DONE IN THE PAST
THAT THE TIME FRAME FOR CLEANING UP OUR AIR IN OUR AND OR UM  LAND YOU KNOW WHICH UH WE GET OUR NUTRIENTS FROM YOU KNOW I MEAN EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO THE LAND
SO WH- UH-HUH UM IT'S JUST UM DAIRY CRITICAL I THINK AT THIS POINT TO UH I GET THAT THROUGH TO THE PEOPLE AND GET AS EDUCATED
UM-HUM
I- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY OFFER CLASSES IN UH THE UH IN THE GRADE SCHOOL UM ON THE SUBJECT THINGS
IN SCIENCE OH OKAY
WHAT GRADE LEVEL WOULD THAT BE WOULD THAT BE UM
PERHAPS THE FIRST GRADE LEVEL WHICH WOULD BE IT
WELL I MEAN I'D BE STARTING THOUGH IT IT WITH THE CHILDREN THAT ARE SO THERE'S LITTLE MINDS ARE LIKE BUNCHES AND THEY CAN REALLY UH RELATE TO THAT
TARGET STORES

YOU KNOW BECAUSE UH
THOUGHTS ARE
UM-HUM
UH-HUH

I REMEMBER BEING I- I GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY
AND UH I CAN REMEMBER THE SMELL OF NEW WORK VIVIDLY  AND IT'S THE BUT THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WHICH OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CAN SMELL IT IT'S IN THE AIR
YEAH
WELL PEOPLE THINK YOUR GUARD IT'S GONE BUT IT'S NOT GONE
UM-HUM
THEN IT JUST GETS INTO THE SOIL AND INTO THE WATER

NOW THE ADULTS ARE MORE AWARE OF IT AND THE CHILDREN ARE BEING TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS MAR-
IT'LL BE YOU KNOW ON DOWN THE ROAD THIS IS GONNA BE PASSED ON WHICH IS GOOD
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT EDUCATION IS A BIG THING YOU KNOW AND AS WE EDUCATE THEM INDIVIDUALLY WHAT THEY CAN DO
PEOPLE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE THINGS IN INDUSTRY TOO THAT THAT ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS AND AND I THINK THAT THE BREAD THE WORKS COURTS FALLING THOSE PROBLEMS MORE TOO
UM
UM-HUM
YEAH  WELL I I I'M SURE THAT HUH <UNK> DEAD
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL I THINK SCIENCES COME A LONG WAY TO MAKING IT
SO THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
UM
I THINK THEY TEACH AT A LOT IN SCIENCE

I
I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF GETTING IT IN ALL DIFFERENT GRADES

UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
HI
W- WANNA BE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I HAVE CONSIDERED ABOUT PAROLE CHANGE FOR WOMEN IS THAT
WOMEN IF MY H- MY GENERATION WERE TRAINED AND TAUGHT IN BROUGHT UP TO BE THE LEAVE IT TO BE FOR HOUSEWIVES BUT WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE WORLD
HUH FAMILIES UM-HUM OH YEAH SURE
UM-HUM
BUT TO CHARACTERISTICALLY YOU KNOW THE WOMEN ARE TRYING TO OR HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST TRAINED IN THE HOME
AND I REALLY WOULD BE AT A LOST ART TO RAISE AND TRAIN A GIRL I THINK I WOULD
OH SURE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
SURE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
SURE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH YEAH
I DID VERY MUCH THE SAME THING AND SO MY BOYS GOT IN HIGH SCHOOL SAID MOM PLEASE DON'T BE INVOLVED
THEN I WENT BACK TO WORK
YEAH
SURE
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN ACTUALLY AND AND IT'S
IT'S IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE OIL ON TOP OF WATER IT CHANGES BUT IT'S NEVER DIFFERENT IN A LOT OF WASTE
UH
WOMEN AT ONE TIME DID VERY HEAVY PHYSICAL LABOR
AND WORRY PERSPECTIVE TO MAINTAIN A HOUSEFUL
THEN IT'S TIMES CHANGED
I- I- IS IT IS TODAY WE DON'T DO A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR EVEN IN HOW EVEN IN HOUSEKEEPING AT HOMEMAKING THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR BECAUSE THERE ARE
UH-HUH RIGHT
AND IN THAT RESPECT WE HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES BECOME INVOLVED IN PHYSICAL EXERTION OR WE REALLY DO DEVELOPED HEALTH PROBLEMS
SO IN IN THAT RESPECT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE HARD WORKERS YEARS PAST WASN'T BETTER FOREST THEM WE'RE WILLING TO ADMIT
AND UH
OH ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT'S IT'S THAT'S TRUE WITH SOCIETY IN GENERAL
BUT SPECIFICALLY THE WOMAN'S ROLE IN SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND YOU YOU KNOW IN IN MEDICAL REPORTS TELL US THAT WOMEN ARE DEVELOPING IT
DISEASES NOW THAT USED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY MAIL DISEASES HEART DISEASES CHARACTERISTIC OF ME AND NOW THERE'S ALMOST EQUALLY PREDOMINANT WIND AND
AND UH I
UM-HUM UH-HUH RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THAT UH THAT THAT'S A SYMPTOM OF OUR SOCIETY IT JUST SENT THEM THAT THERE'S THERE'S A GENERAL ILLNESS IT NEEDS TO BE HEELS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HEALING PROFITS WOULD BE OR WHAT IT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM I'M NOT I'M NOT GOD
BUT I I DO KNOW THAT IN RAISING MY BOYS
I REALLY DID MEET A LOT OF PRESSURES THING YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO MUSIC LESSONS YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO SPORTS YOU NEED TO GET THEM IN TODAY IS THEY NEED TO BE BUSY AND THEY NEED TO BE ACTIVE
AND I THOUGHT ALL OF THOSE THINGS IS IF THOSE BOYS WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT THEY WILL COME TO ME AND THEY WILL SAY MOM THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME I WANNA DO IT OTHERWISE I WILL GUARD THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE QUITE TIME
I REFUSED TO CRAM THEIR LOT'S FULL THAT'S WHAT IT IS WITH A WOMAN TOO
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OF COURSE
UM-HUM
WELL I JUST AM VERY MUCH A BELIEVER IN QUIET PERSONAL TIME IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK TO YOURSELF WHO YOU KNOW TALK TO RIGHT
AND I'D GUARDED MY CHILDREN'S RIGHT FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOMEN ARE SACRIFICING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DO
THERE'S SACRIFICING THEIR TIME WITH THEMSELVES
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SITTING IN BEING BOARD IF YOU ARE THINKING INTERNALLY INJURE WORKING ON YOUR OWN SELF YOU FINDING OUT WHO YOU ARE
WELL I THINK
HUM WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S NOT YOUR HOMEWORK AT YOUR CHILDREN TO WORK
AND I WAS ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL TO BE THERE ONLY WHEN THEY CAME TO ME AND I ASKED ME FOR HELP I HELPED WITH EXACTLY WHAT THEY ASK FOR AND THAT'S ALL
THAT'S THE PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD AND DADDY IS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THINGS THAT REALLY ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S RESPONSIBILITIES
THEY
AND THEY
THAT'S RIGHT THAT WAY HUSBANDS ARE CRIPPLED

YEAH WELL SHE SHE SITS AND DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF OR SHE'S YOU
THAT SHE'S TWO MONTHS NOW NINE WEEKS AND SHE'S A DRASTICALLY MOVING RUSSIA ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER AND THINGS OF THAT AND AND SHE STARTED THAT LIKE GUESS SHARE THE DAY BEFORE
AND JUST EVERYDAY IT'S A DIFFERENT AND I THINK THAT IT I THINK HEALTH CARE FOR INSTANCE IS MUCH HARDER THAN WHEN THEY'RE OLDER AND
I'LL PROBABLY BE GOING BACK TO WORK AROUND JANUARY WAY IT SHOULD BE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS OLD AND SO I THINK IN SOME YOU HAD A A PRODUCER ROUGHAGE PUT THEM INTO A
YEAH
BUT BUT I THINK IT
YEAH WE'RE JUST GOING TO SEE UH THINGS WORK OUT UM BUT I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW BE FOR A FAIR AND EVEN THIS YOUNG AGE WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS JUST TO GO TO A MOVIE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT SHE USED TO OTHER PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF IT
MY PARENTS MY HUSBAND'S PARENTS ARE IN FRANCE SO SOME OF THE HARD EVER DURING ISSUES SHE'S SHE'S MET THEM ALREADY
NOT THAT STILL REMEMBER THEM WHICH IS NOT UH
UH-HUH
A BILL NEARBY
YEAH

YEAH WELL RIGHT NOW THE SITUATION IS SO TIGHT THAT MANY PLACES THAT IT'S EVEN HARD TO HAVE A CHOICE
INCREDIBLE THAT NEWS SERVICES PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET PREGNANT ARE FINDING CHILD CARE FOR THAT  AND YEAH I JUST FIND THAT INCREDIBLE AND MY SISTER WAS GONNA HAVE A BEING VERY VERY FISHING INTENDING TO STAY HOME WITH THE BABY
AND YOU MAYBE DO SOME FREE LANCE TYPE WORK FROM HOME AND SO IF I GO BACK TO WORK ON A PART-TIME BASIS I'M HOPING I CAN LEAVE MY DAUGHTER WITH HER BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER YOU KNOW IT'LL BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS
UH MY DAUGHTER BE ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLDER THAN HERS AND YOU KNOW THE LITTLE ROUGH WHEN SHE WAS VERY VERY LITTLE INCENTIVES LIKE WHICH IS A MONTH OR SO THAT MY SISTER WAS HAD LAST MONTH OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH BABYSITTING FOR BARGE FAMILIES AND SO UH
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT A COUPLE OF HOURS A WEEK YOU MIGHT EVEN GO TO A TRADE OFF IT'S JUST THAT I WATCH THEIR BABY WHEN THEY WANNA GO OUT TO DINNER TO MOVIES OR WHATEVER SHE WAS AN AFTERNOON A- EVEN ISSUE WITH AN EXTREME JUST TO WORK
UM AND NOT BE BOTHERED WE'VE ACTIVITIES CHANGE THAT WAY
AND SO WE JUST HAVE TO SEE HIM THINGS FOR YOU KNOW BUT I THINK THE WHOLE YOU KNOW I IDEALLY I THINK THAT
BUSINESSES SH- SHOULD HAVE THE DAY CARE CENTERS THERE WHETHER IT'S THE PARENTS TO TAKE TURNS WATCHING THE KIDS WHEN THEY HIRE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND YOUR PARENTS KIND OF IMPROVISE OR WHATEVER
OH
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH WELL SHE'S MY DAUGHTER DOES IS CHANGING ON A REAL SCHEDULE YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY MY FAULT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A REAL SCHEDULE NOW BUT
YEAH BUT SHE'S BEEN STAYING UP LATE AT NIGHT AND HE WAS SLEEPING LATE IN THE MORNINGS AND THINGS WHICH IS FINE BUT I MEAN BECAUSE
RIGHT
OKAY WHO DO YOU WORK WITH DO YOU WORK AROUND CHILDREN WHEN YOU WORK OR NOT IT ALL OVER WITH COMPUTERS
OKAY DO YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE CHILDREN

I THINK IT DOES WHEN WHEN THEY'RE REAL LITTLE AND THEIR CHANGING EVERY DAY OR SO AND YOU JUST MISSED THE LITTLE THINGS AND AND UH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT WELL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE BONDING THAT THEY DO IT WITH A MOTHER THIS IS
RIGHT
OUR OLDEST GRANDSON WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS ALL WENT INTO A HOME ON A STORY DAY CARE SYSTEM AND THEY TOOK INSTANCE STARTING IN SIX WEEKS AND THEY HAVE A PROGRAM UM
AND THAT WAS DIVIDED BY THIS MONTESSORI PERSON AND AND UH A CERTAIN TYPES OF STIMULATIONS AND THERE'S TIMES A DAY THAT EVEN WHEN THE CHILD IS THE WAY BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY LAY QUIETLY
AND LOOK AT CERTAIN THINGS THEY KEEP DELIBERATELY KEEP THE ROOM NOT REAL BRIGHT AND AND UH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY'LL PUT THEM DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND COURSE THEY NEVER HAVE MORE THAN LIKE FIVE
AND AN OPEN DOWN THE FLOOR AND THEY'LL HAVE A LOT I THINK ONE WAS A LITTLE AMERICAN SOMEWHERE JUST DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT HAD HAD A DEFINITE PURPOSE <UNK> FOUR KIDS YOU KNOW AND OR SOMETHING ABOUT THERE ARE NICE
YEAH UM I'VE CALLED ISSUE  OH YEAH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
IT IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE CLEAN TO MAMA SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT
I THINK IT IT HURTS THE PARENTS BELIEVE WHEN THE CHILD IS CRIME SO IT YOU KNOW BE IDEAL IF YOU COULD GET SOMEBODY AND SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY LEAVING THE CHILD AND STRANGE PLATES YEAH WITH THAT'S UNUSUAL
UH-HUH
OH IS THAT YOUR PARENTS ARE YOUR YOUR HUSBAND AND I
UM AND
RIGHT RIGHT IT THAT'S NICE WHEN I MY I HAVE THREE GRANDCHILDREN OTHER ONE COMING IN SEPTEMBER I IT WOULD IF THEY WERE
RIGHT COULDN'T GET MY HANDS ON I'M AFRAID UP  YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW I'VE I LIKE THAT BUT IF IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THEM IN CHILD CARE THAT'S
THAT'S AN IDEAL SITUATION FOR YOU IS TO STAY WITH THEM AS WELL AS YOU CAN ALL SET UP YOUR WORK PROGRAM IN YOUR HUSBAND SO THAT ONE OF US THERE ALL THE TIME THAT'S THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR THE CHILD
BUT I WORK PART RIGHT THEN YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO WITH CHILD CARE YOU REALLY NEED TO TO
LOOK AT WHAT YOUR OPTIONS ARE AND AND LOOK AT THE WHAT THEY OFFERED AND DROP IN AT TIMES THAT
OUR OWN EXPECTED TO
UM-HUM
OH
UM-HUM UM-HUM
OH
OH THAT'S EVEN WONDERFUL
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UM-HUM
OH
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I DO TOO
REALLY WELL TRAIN WHATEVER RIGHT HAVE HAVE SOME KIND OF REAL GOOD PROGRAM SET UP SO THAT YOU WHEN YOU GO YOU CAN BE SURE THAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY THAT PERSON IN CHARGE NO CPR FOR STATE OR
IT HAS SOME KIND OF PROGRAMS UP LIKE YOU SAY TO STIMULATE THE KIDS ARE EDUCATE THEM SOME MANNER AND HAVE THEM YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO ALWAYS IN THE RIGHT SETTING AND
I HAVE A UNORGANIZED TYPE OF PROGRAMS THAT UP SO THAT THE KIDS HAVE A SCHEDULE YOU KNOW THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT A LITTLE YOU KNOW
UM-HUM THEY THEY HAD JUST WHAT THE PARENTS
UH-HUH
W- YOU KNOW THAT WORKS UNTIL THEY START SCHOOL RIGHT AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM SOCIETY IS GEARED TO ADD A DAY PERSON AND IT'S
OKAY WELL I UH I GUESS BECAUSE I WORK QUITE A BIT WITH LAWYERS I'M NOT A LAWYER UH BUT I F- FIND A LOT OF THINGS ARE SO SPECIALIZED THAT I'M NOT SURE
AND I I LOOK AT IT MORE FROM THE CIVIL SIDE OF THINGS THE JURIES HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF OF VALUE OF KIND WORTH SO THAT THEY HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WHEN IT COMES TO UH UH THEY CAN FIND GUILT OR INNOCENCE
UH BUT THEN WHEN YOU QUANTIFY THINGS AND THAT MIGHT ALSO WHOLE CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR HOW MANY YEARS IS APPROPRIATE UH THAT THEY MIGHT LEAVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO UH HAS EXPERTISE IN THAT
UM-HUM
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I FIND THE TIME I'VE BEEN UH FUTURE IS SO AND UH THIS UH I- I TEND TO BE AROUND A CIVIL CASES
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AN EXPERT WITNESS UH AND UH
MANY MATTERS ARE SO COMPLICATED THAT IT'S SO HARD TO UH COME UP WITH A FAIR VALUE UH
OR THE FAIR SAM'S AND ONE THING THAT YOU GET IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERTISE IS
UH UH YOU KNOW OLD THE RANGE OF ALL POSSIBLE VALUES OR TERMS OR YOU KNOW HALL HEINOUS WITH THE CRIME
UH THAT UH WHEN I ONLY DO SOMETHING ONE TWO OR THREE TIMES I'M HARDLY AN EXPERT ON THAT AND
MOST JURIES
OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOU MIGHT SIT ON THREE
AND SO HOW DO YOU RELATE AS TO WHETHER THIS
PARTICULAR ARMED ROBBERY WAS A IT WORKED FIVE YEARS OR TWENTY FIVE
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
ONE OF THE OTHER THING IS AGAINST MAN ON THE JURIES IS THAT OFTEN IN THE NEWSPAPER
I- I- I TEND TO HEAR TOO SINGS THAT WELL THAT GO ON ONE IS YOU ALSO SEE IN THE HEADLINES
THE BIG NUMBERS
UH AND MANY OF THOSE GET OVERTURNED OR GET REDUCED IN TERMS OF SENTENCES GET CHANGED
BY JUDGE OR APPEALS COURT AND THAT NEVER MAKES THE THE PRESS AND SO WHEN UH DO YOU WERE UH AS AN INDIVIDUAL
IT'S ON A JURY WE TEND TO HAVE CERTAIN MENTAL IMAGE IS SO WHAT'S WHAT BECAUSE WE SEE THE HEADLINES
UH AND WE DON'T HAVE A A GET A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON WHAT IS UH
REALLY THE RANGE OF SENSES OR AWARDS THAT ARE UH ARE ACTUALLY UH IN THE AND APPLIED
UM-HUM
OH
YEAH
WELL UH THAT'S WHERE UH  THE ROLE OF JURIES IS BE- IS RESTRICTED AND UH I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT TO CHANGE THAT ASPECT OF ONE IS IT'S RESTRICTED IN THE SENSE THAT IT
BUR- EASE BOWL THEY DECIDED THAT CHARGES UH THAT ARE ACTUALLY UH BROUGHT YOU KNOW IF IT'S FIRST DEGREE RAPE SECOND OR GREAT DEGREE RAPE OR WHATEVER
THEY ONLY GET TO DECIDE ON THAT WELL OKAY THIS PERSON HAS BEEN CHARGE WAS FIRST DEGREE RAPE UH AND YOU CAN DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE I'M OUT UH SO SO IT MAY BE AN MURDER THEY GET TO CHOOSE WHETHER IT'S A PREMEDITATED DOOR
ONE OR TWO OF THE LESSER DEGREES AND THE OTHER THING THAT JURIES ARE RESTRICTED AUTOMA- AND AT LEAST TO ME THIS IS BUT ONE OF THE FRUSTRATING THINGS MIGHT EVEN IN MY OWN EXPERIENCES ABOUT YOU
USUALLY DON'T GET TO HEAR ALL THE INFORMATION IT'S WHATEVER FROM A S- IT'S PRESENTED AND
UH I DON'T KNOW THE JURIES HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW L- MORE BECAUSE IN A SENSE WE CALL THOSE SAFEGUARDS BUT OFTEN JURIES FEAR OLEO FRACTION OF THE OF THE STORY
WHEN THEY HAVE TO DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE
UM-HUM
YEAH AND THE TRUTH THAT'S ABOUT ALL THIS UH AS I SAY WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE THE OF THE OLD JUST TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRIPS NOTHING ABOUT THE TRUTH
IS THAT THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THEY DON'T WANT UH THE WHOLE TROOPS YOU COULD SAY YEAH IS OKAY BECAUSE STORIES LOOK VERY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HEAR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OF THE TRUTH
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT I AGREE TOO I DON'T THINK THE JURY SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT THAT PUT THE SINCE THE CITY AND THINGS DOWN I THINK THE JUDGES SHOULD DOOR AT EVEN A PANEL OF LAWYERS IF IF IT GOT TO THAT POINT
MIGHT BE BETTER OUT THAN JUST REGULAR CIVIL PEOPLE
NOT KNOWING YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THINGS ARE YOU FROM FROM MURDER ON UP TOO LIKE PACK STUFF YOU KNOW
RIGHT
YEAH AND
RIGHT THAT'S YEAH AN- AND MOST PEOPLE THAT DO CENTER SOME PEOPLE JUST SAT ON THEM ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME YOU UP THERE THAT LUCKY  TIMES OR YOU KNOW WHAT- WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE AND IT MAY NOT HAVE ANY IDEA
UH WHAT WHAT THE STANDARD PUNISHMENT WOULD BE FOR IT AND AND THEY MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT IDEA I MEAN IT IT MIGHT BE IN ONE FORM FOR THEM TO PUT IS AND THEY SEND SENTENCING DOWN THAT WAS UM
LONGER YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T FIT THE PUNISHMENT DIDN'T FIT THE CRIME
OR NOT LONG ENOUGH BOY OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE
NOT THAT I THINK THE JUDGE IS IT DO HAVE THAT THAT BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND THE ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT SOMETIMES IT IS IF YOU GET SOMEBODY IN THERE THAT THAT HAS BEEN A THAT IS THE DEFENDANT AND
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES MIGHT HAVE MORE PULL WHICH THAT DOES HAPPEN I MEAN WE CAN'T SAY IT DOESN'T BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN I MEAN NOT EVERYBODY IS IS IT YOU KNOW
HAS HAS THE RIGHT MORALS SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE CAN BE PAID OFF OR POLITICALLY OR
WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE AND SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT REAL SCARY THOUGH SO
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT WELL WHILE SO WHAT I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EATERS WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE UH SAY A RAPIST COME AND AND AND HIS ATTORNEY
GET DISTANCES SENSING REDUCED BECAUSE HE'S GONE TO A LESSER CHARGE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ASSAULT OR SOMETHING OR
I- I WISH THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME EITHER I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PROVE RAPED AND WHATNOT AND AND AND THE PERSON THAT WAS RAPED A WHA- DOES THAT YEAH I MEAN IT'S EMBARRASSING AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF AND THEY'RE THEY'RE PUT ON LIKE
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT COST OR WHATEVER BUT TO ME WHEN YOU DO THE CRIME
THEN YOU SHOULD PAY FOR WHATEVER YOU DEAD AND I- AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE I WILL GO ON THE LESSER CHARGE I I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE ALL THAT'S GOING TO DO IS SAY OH WELL YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS A BREEZE I CAN GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN AND YOU KNOW
HAVE THE SAME THING HAPPENED THAT'S THAT'S NOT RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
AND TO ME HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE A DECISION IF YOU DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AND FRIENDS OR WHETHER IT BE A WH- WHETHER PERTAINS TO THE CASE OR NOT IT SOMEBODY THINGS THAT I- IT HAD BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT IT THERE
I- STILL THE LAWYERS TO TWO LAWYERS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION DON'T THEY
THEY ONLY PUT PART OF IT
YEAH
RIGHT WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE THAT OH WITNESS OKAY WELL IT'S A GAME KIDS PLAYED TOO BUT UM
SOMEBODY DID IT JUST I-
FOR YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT WHERE THEY THEY SHOWED SOMETHING
OKAY
ALL RIGHT WELL I GUESS I YEAH I I WAS EXPECTING  QUESTION ABOUT AIDS SALT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT BUT I GUESS I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE RESEARCH UM I'M JUST CONCERN THIS IS GONNA BE SUCH A MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM
AND IF WE YOU KNOW AND IF IT'S NOT I SAVE IT SEEMS TO ME THIS IN EVERY DAY CARE AT THE BETTER OFF FOR GOING TO BE
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THINK AND IT'S GOING TO START AFFECTING ALL OF THE POPULATION YOU KNOW I MEAN RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU KNOW AND IT'S JUST GOING TO BE COME SUCH A HUGE ISSUE
AND IT'S JUST SO SCARY THAT THERE'S JUST NOT MUCH THEY CAN BE DONE AT THIS POINT SO I GUESS
YES

ANY NEVER SMOKED EVEN A GREAT BUYING MUCH LESS THE STICKER OUT YOU KNOW THE
JUST DO YOU NAME IT HE HE JUST UH WAS HORRIBLE MOST HORRIBLE
YEAH AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GOT FOUR MONTHS AFTER RANDY DAD
AND UH HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THAT HE JUST YOU KNOW HOW TO CALL THEY DIDN'T SAY CALL WINTER
AND GET GET SECOND STICKER EMPOWERMENT HOSPITAL AND UH HAD NEW MONEY IN THOSE LOANS RIFLE AND HE DIED WITHIN ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
YEAH UH
YEAH YEAH AND HIS FRIEND HAD DIED THE YEAR BEFORE
AND A 401- EIGHT SPEND THE TIME TO KNOW UH
YOU KNOW SO
WHO HAS JUST THAT THAT'S CLOSE TO HOME
YOU'RE KIDDING YOU KNOW
UH-HUH GOSH
UH-HUH
AIDS ISSUE IS
IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM I GUESS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND NOT HAVING ANY IMMEDIATE FRIENDS WITH THAT PROBLEM IS IS A FINANCIAL THAT UH YOU KNOW
CAN A COUNTRY STAND TO UH SPEND AS MUCH ARE MUCH MORE THAN THEY ARE ARE
WELL IT'S SUCH A PROBLEM UH BUT THEN THAT KIND OF THINKING IS ALSO TEMPERED WITH THE THE KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST THE THE RUMOR  NOT REALLY SURE THAT'S TRUE OR NOT THAT UH WE'RE NOT SPENDING
AS MUCH PER LET'S SAY AFFLICTED PERSON WITH CANCER UH THERE'S SOME UH A REST ANSWER FOR INSTANCE IT SEEMS TO BE DOING MUCH MORE DAMAGING AFFECTING MUCH MORE COULD BE MORE PEOPLE THAN AIDS
AND YET UH MORE PEOPLE BUT YET THE FUNDING IS ALREADY UH EXCEEDED AIDS HAS MORE MONEY THAN THE BREAST CANCER JUS-
SO UH IT IT'S IT'S TRUE I I'VE I'VE ONLY HEARD THEY SAY THAT NEVER BOTHERED TO DO GET OUT AND MAKE SURE BUT UH
I'VE HEARD IT ON MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENTARY THAT UH THERE WERE COMPLAINING THAT
WHOEVER CITY OF THEY'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS UH OR WHATEVER INSTITUTIONS RAISE THE MONEY AND UH
IT'S JUST ONE BIG PR CAMPAIGN THAT YEAH WE THINK THAT'S THE WORLD'S WORST THINGS LET'S GIVE MONEY TO AIDS
YEAH WE HAD BREAST CANCER PROBLEMS FOR YEARS AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE
OF COURSE ONE OF THE SHOWS I SAW WAS TAKING FROM THE ANGLE THAT INTO DOESN'T EFFECT MEN THAT STARTED AT FUNDED
AND UH I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE
OKAY WELL I I TRY I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S NOT MY VIEW POSSIBLE SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN IN CONTROL OF THAT KIND OF THING BUT THEN I GOT I GOT TO THINKING
THE THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF MEN SEEMS TO BE THE PROSTATE AND THERE'S ONLY ONE TEST JUST RECENTLY GOT DEVELOPED UH BULLETIN ANTIGEN UH PAY ANTIBODY TESTS FOR HITTING THE BLOOD
AND THAT'S FAIRLY RECENT THEY'D GET BETTER THAN BUYING FROM PROFIT CANCER FOR YEARS
SO IT'S NOT REALLY CARE FOR YEAH IT'S NOT UH NOT THAT HEAVILY FUNDED EITHER AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE THE MAJOR
UH PROBLEMS AND THEN HAVING THE REALM OF CANCER SO I DON'T KNOW I- I GUESS THERE'S JUST SOME STRANGE PUBLIC OPINION AS TO WHO THEY WANT TO GIVE TO UM BE IT
THROUGH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS MARKER DINE TYPES UH TELL LAWNS OR BICYCLE RIDES OR WHATEVER
HELL THEY FUND WHATEVER UH IT WAS A WHICH IS KIND OF HARD TO
TO GET IN EVEN KILLING THEM IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WELL THERE'S YOU KNOW HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR AFFECTED BY THIS ONE SO LET'S GIVE IT THAT'S THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS OTHER ONES ONLY A TENTH OF THAT SORT OF A TENTH OF THAT AND THEN JUST KEEP DOING IT OUT THAT WAY OR
HUH
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE
YOU KNOW THE THE OTHER THOUGHT THAT I HAD UM I'VE HAD SEVERAL MINUTES TO THINK ABOUT THE SUCKER UH THE ONE OF THOSE FINDING PEOPLE I UH
I COULD THINK ABOUT THE TOPIC LONGER THAN THE PERSON THAT RECEIVES IT'S SO IT'S KIND OF A
IS UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AS IT WERE BUT
THE OTHER THING THAT I THOUGHT OF ON THIS IS I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY
UH IN OUR ECONOMY OR OUR SYSTEM UH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT GOES TO THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY DO A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD I MEAN YEAH THEY'RE KIND OF NICE BUT
WE HAVE SUCH UH FLUENT ASIDE IT SOCIETY THAT I WONDER IF WE TOOK A LITTLE FROM HERE AND THERE AND THE OTHER IF WE MIGHT WIND UP WITH UH UH TWO OR FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE ANY ROOM TO PUT PEOPLE BUT
YEAH YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THESE RIDICULOUS FIGURES FOR PIZZA OR YOU'RE USED TO DO THAT FOR MY LITTLE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS SPENT FOR THIS BETTER THE OTHER AND YOU HAVE ALL THE PARTS THAT THEY'RE NICE AND STATIC BUT
ARE THEY YOU THAT ENHANCING FOR THEM FOR THE MASSES YOU KNOW THEY CERTAINLY DO WELL FOR THOSE WHO GO TO THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND ALL THAT BUT UH
AND WELL THAT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT YEAH
RIGHT
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY GIVEN AND ATTENTION EITHER
RIGHT
WELL I'M I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE ONE THAT SITS IN CHARGE OF OF MAKING THE DECISIONS THEY UH
YOU WISH THAT THERE COULD JUST BE MONEY FOR ALL THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SIZE SERIOUS YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S NOT THE SAYS I GUESS UNTIL FX YOUR FAMILY AND AND ALL THIS AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
SO I- I WOULD HATE TO HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY JUST PERSONALLY BUT BUT THEN AGAIN THEY REALLY IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE IT AS A SOCIETY TO DECIDE WHICH THINGS WE NEED TO ADDRESS
UH-HUH YEAH
I GUESS UH IT IT FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK OF SO MANY PEOPLE WITH WITH A TEN WITH CANCER AND
MANY OF THOSE THINGS UM IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TO BE INSURANCE AND THE COUNTRY'S GONNA PAY FOR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH
PREVENTION OR OR TREATMENT OR YOU KNOW
JUST UH JUST HELPING THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES

WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN THAT ARE IN SPORTS AND SO YOU KNOW IS IT MAKES THEIR GAMES PEOPLE SPAWNED FOREVER NEVER NEVER ON THEM AND UM
UH-HUH
I LIKE TO SEE
UM-HUM
YEAH
NOTHING ABOUT WHEN IT GETS HOT HERE IS I DON'T LIKE THE HUMIDITY THAT'S
UM-HUM
OH IS THAT RIGHT IT  WELL ANOTHER REASON WHY I GUESS I CAN'T SAY THAT
I DON'T LIKE THE RAIN COMPLETELY WE HAVE THE LITTLE GARDEN THAT WE HAVE AND AND SO IT REALLY HELPS OUR CAR AND AND YOU KNOW YOU AND I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S BECAUSE PLANTS ARE JUST THAT WAY AND THEY LIKE RAIN OR IT SEEMS THEY UPRIGHT WHEN IT RAINS THEY REALLY
UM-HUM YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THE
WELL I LIKE SEVENTIES I LIKE SEVENTIES HE
OH I DON'T MIND NINETIES YOU CAN GIVE ME SEVENTIES AND YOU GET ME AT NINE OKAY BUT WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT THEY KNEW THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT I STAY IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE
IT'S JUST
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S
IT JUST REALLY GETS WHE- WHEN IT GETS A TWO DIVIDED
AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN HERE YEARS WHEN IT'S BEEN HUNDREDTHS
AND THEY
YEARS UM
YEAH
YEAH HE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A GOOD JOB LIKE THAT
AND GOOD WITH THEM
UM-HUM
ANYWAY UM
IT'S IT'S
THAT'S OKAY THEY SAY WE NEED A NEW TEN SO YEAH I I AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO SAY YOU HAD A FEW TINY JUST THEY HAVE A GOOD DAY OR WHATEVER IT IS TO YOU TOO
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT SENDING AN ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBER TOO IN NURSING HOMES
UH-HUH
RIGHT
AND WHAT TYPE OF RECOMMENDATIONS DID YOU HAVE WHEN YOU DECIDED WHERE TO PLACE HIM
ALL MY LIFE
YEAH SO THE CONVENIENCE
RIGHT
MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED WITH US UM UNTIL AUGUST UM AND WE MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME SHE HAS LEUKEMIA
AND HURT THE REST OF HER FAMILY AND HER REGULAR DOCTORS AND EVERYBODY SHE TRUSTED THE NEW ONES IN DAYTON AND WERE SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES AWAY
SO I MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME IN MY SISTER BEING ON THE OTHER HAND FOUND ONE
THAT SHE COULD HAVE WHAT'S CALLED AN INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITY SHE HAD HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AND DIDN'T HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH ANY WANTING TO BRING IN OUR OWN SHARE AND TV SET ITSELF
YES AND THAT THE OTHER MAJOR FACTOR IS THAT SHE NEEDS BLOOD TRANSFUSION EVERY WEEK TO TEN DAYS YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED TODAY HERE TOO SO IN THIS FACILITY THEY CAN DO IT RIGHT THERE FROM OUR OWN ROOM
SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED BACK AND FORTH SO SHE'S BEEN THERE SINCE AUGUST THE THIRTEENTH AND SEEMS TO ADJUST IT PRETTY WELL IT'S NOT OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO BE AND SHE'D MUCH RATHER BE HERE WITH ME BUT
WHEN IT GOT TO THE POINT I WAS SPENDING MORE TIME AT THE HOSPITAL WITH HER AND I'VE GOT LITTLE CHILDREN HERE WHO NEEDED ME HERE
UH SHE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO WATCH A TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
UH-HUH
SHE WAS FALLING DOWN AND HEMORRHAGING AND YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL PROBLEMS SO IT IT JUST BECAME TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE EVEN THOUGH I WOULD'VE LIKED IT HAD OR STAY WITH THEIR HOUSE BEING WHAT WHAT SHE COULDN'T ANYMORE
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE GET TO BE A CERTAIN AGE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO KIND OF HOPING MAKE DECISIONS SURE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN GRANNY'S DECISION TO LEAVE US AND GO BACK TO A NURSING HOME BUT SHE'S ACCEPTED IT REAL WELL NOW
SO
WELL WE ENJOYED HAVING A HERE BUT WE FEEL SHE'S NOT SAFER WHERE SHE IS NOW SHE STILL CONTINUES TO FALL BUT WHEN SHE DOES THE AIR AND NURSES RIGHT THERE TO HELP HER
AND I KNOW SHE'S EATING THE RIGHT THINGS AND HER DOCTORS RIGHT THERE WERE SPEAKING COME IN AND CHECK ON OR SO
IT BECAME DANGEROUS FOR US TO KEEP TRANSPORTING HER BACK AND FORTH IN THE CAR BECAUSE SHE WAS SO WOBBLY AND NEEDED A WALKER OR WHEELCHAIR
SO I THINK CHILL IT UH IT
RIGHT
WELL I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT UH I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE
SEND MY GRANDFATHER TO A NURSING HOME AT THE POINTS WHEN HE WAS REALLY IN CAPABLE OF CARING FOR HIMSELF ANYMORE HE ACTUALLY DIED A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT AND SO
HAS A LEASE IN RETROSPECT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE HE UH
IT WAS EITHER NO IN NURSING
HOME MORE HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT HE WOULD THAN SPENDING MOST THIS TIME IN THOSE DAYS
UM WELL BEING
SEE YEAH WELL WE
HE WANTED TO GET INTO A MAN IN A NURSING HOME WHICH IS VERY POPULAR AND IT'S HARD TO GET INTO IT HAD LIKE A TEN YEAR WAITING LIST
RIGHT WE WOUND UP JUST CHOOSING A ANOTHER MENNONITE NURSING HOME THAT WAS EASIER TO GET INTO
I WOULD NOT CHILI THAT WASN'T EVEN MEN AND IT REALLY IS UM SO I- IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT NURSING HOME MOSTLY
THAT'S A MOST THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE HE SUDDENLY GOT SICK AND NEEDED TO BE PUT IN
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH THAT'S IMPORTANT <UNK> SAY
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT SO THAT
RIGHT THAT BECOMES DIFFICULT UH
UM-HUM YEP WE TRIED TO CONVINCE MY GRANDFATHER TO LIVE WITH US THAT SEVERAL THE POINTS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE
BUT HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TO PROWLER INTO
INDEPENDENT FOR THAT EVEN THOUGH HIS HEART WAS
GETTING INCREDIBLY WEEKENDS KNEES OR GOING BAD HE
LIVED IN
HIS OWN HOUSE AS LONG AS HE COULD THOUGH HE WAS LIVING ALONE
HAD AN UP STAIRS APARTMENTS COULD BARELY MAKE UP THE STEPS CITY UH TOP WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF PAINT
AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY
THINGS JUST ONE TOO FAR AND HE
ALLOW HIMSELF TO PUT INTO A NURSING HOME
RIGHT WELL THAT'S
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT THE CHILDREN I HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO UH TO THEIR PARENTS AND SUCH TO
HELP DECIDE WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING
AND
UM-HUM
YEP
I HAD IS THAT HOW MANY HOW YOU YOU
OKAY THAT THING THAT CAME IT HAS ANYTHING TO MAKE IT MA- AROU- BUT MEMORABLE BY THAT FIRST OF ALL YOU NEEDED TO
WELL THAT ABOUT THE SAME TIME EVERY YEAR I THE SAME WEEK OF THE THE SAME UM
AND AND THEN YOU'D HAVE TO SEND OUT
IT YOU KNOW GOOD FLY AREAS IN THE MOUNTAINS ALL THAT YOU WANTED TO AND IT
THAT CONFIDENCE IN THERE COULD BE YEAR  YOUR P-
PLACE TO GET PEOPLE THERE THAN THE ONES THAT THEY TENDED
SOME OF HAD BREAKFAST IN LINE SITS AND THE WHOLE DAY AND AND UM  OF COURSE JUST HAVE ONE SURE
AND UH SO IT'S LIKE A CHRISTMAS TIME AND IT DID DINNER REUNIONS
AND
THE UH KIND OF AND THEN THEY'RE USUALLY HAVE
I'VE SEEN TALENT FOR HIS NAME UM MAINLY THE KID THERE THERE AND
YOU NEED PROBABLY HE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ANCESTORS TO TIE THAT PAID
WELL WHY DON'T YOU START THINKING MORE TIME TO THINK  YOU KNOW I
WELL HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT TOPIC
DO YOU I DON'T
NO I'M PRETTY OPINIONATED ABOUT THAT IN MANY OTHER THINGS YOU WELL THOUGH

IT'S A MINI THE PEOPLE EVEN THE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WHILE THEY WERE SHOW AGAINST THEM DOING IT YOU KNOW AND UH SHE'S TO ME IT'S QUITE SIMPLE UH
EVEN NEED A JOB WHERE YOU DO- THE JOBS WILL PROVIDE ALL OF YOUR NEEDS
AND UH IF THEY SAY HEY YOU CAN'T DO THIS WORK THAT'S I AGREE I- I- I- IT I THINK MOST OF THEM HAVE AGREED TO THAT MAY ALTHOUGH IT IT LIKE IT FOR
YEAH IT IS I CAN SEE WHERE YOU WOULD THINK YEAH THE THE LITTLE YOU KNOW I PROBABLY FEEL THE SAME WAY
IF I HAD TO DO IT
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YOU BET OH GOSH I THEY WOULD REALLY RAISES THEY GIVE THAT TO HAPPEN

THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT DRUG TESTING UH IT'S
AND WE WERE LAUGHING THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO THE EXAMINATIONS TO PROVE WE COULD RING RIGHT WITH THE BEST AND OF YOUR IN
AND WE FOUND THAT THE LITTLE THING

WELL WHAT ADVICE DID YOU GIVE THEM WHEN THEY WERE CHOOSING THEIR COLLEGES IT LOOKS LIKE THEY UH YOU HAVE A VARIETY THERE
WELL
WHERE YOU'RE GOING RIGHT DOWN MY LIST OF THE FIRST THING THAT I ALWAYS TALK TO STUDENTS ABOUT IS THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT ISN'T ON DOING ANY GOOD NO MATTER HOW BAD YOU WANNA COME HERE
AND UH COST IS ALWAYS UH USUALLY NEXT ON THE LIST ESPECIALLY FOR THE PARENTS AND UH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SCHOLARSHIPS
AND USUALLY THEN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT UH THE SIZE OF THE SCHOOL AND UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT THEY CAN GET INVOLVED IN AND OF COURSE DISTANCE FROM HOME IN SIZE OF CLASSES AND
UH IT SOUNDS LIKE UH FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW HOW TO GO RIGHT DOWN THE LIST WITH THEM
YEAH YOU YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING ESPECIALLY WHEN UH UH MY EXPERIENCE UH HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUT OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITY
AND UH A LOT OF THE STUDENTS IN THAT HOME TOWN UH SOMETIMES S- ON THE IDEA OF STAYING IN GOING TO SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET SO TO SPEAK
BUT UH IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL I'M GOING TO THE STATE TO MIND GETTING OUT HERE AND I'M GOING WAY OVER THERE
AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN IT GETS RIGHT DOWN TO THE PRACTICAL ASPECT OF IT THEY END UP STAYING PRETTY DARN CLOSE TO HOME BECAUSE THEY CAN SAVE MONEY AS FAR AS HOUSING AND UH LAUNDRY
YOU BET  BUT IT SURE DOESN'T
SURE
UH I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S A SEVENTH GRADER AND THEN I HAVE A SON THAT'S A SOPHOMORE AT UH SHEPTON HIGH SCHOOL
AND SO IT'S UH IT'S BEEN INTERESTING WATCHING THEM I SIGNED UP FOR APPROPRIATE COURSE WORK AND THINGS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ON THE COLLEGE BOND TRACK AT LEAST
WELL I UH THEY CERTAINLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES BUT UH IN TERMS OF NEEDS THE OLDER SON IS INTERESTED IN THE MEDICAL FIELD
AND UH AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT YOU KNOW TAKING APPROPRIATE COURSE WORK WHAT REALLY NOTHING UH THAT'S AN OUT OF THE ORDINARY
AND UH THE DAUGHTER IS INDICATED THAT UH SHE WANTS TO GET A DEGREE IN UH
BUSINESS UH AND AND GO ON TO BECOME PRESIDENT  YOU BET AND
WELL I UH UH YOU KNOW WEIRD WE WE TRY TO BE CONSCIOUS OF UH UH THE UH EQUAL UH EQUAL RIGHTS AND UH WELL
MY GOODNESS THAT'S UNUSUAL
OH MY GOSH WELL MINE ARE GROWN ME AND UH OF COURSE UH I'VE ALREADY BEEN TRUE THIS MUCH THEN
AND I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO HELP WITH GRANDCHILDREN ONE OF THESE DAYS I'LL
WELL WELL INTO A NEIL IN ONE WENT TO UM UH OH STEPHEN F AUSTIN AND WE WENT TO NORTH TEXAS AND WE WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS
AND IT'S ONE OF THEM ENDED UP AT ELSE IN PAYROLL IN ONE OF THE UH SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS IN ANOTHER ONE IS PUT NEW STUFF TOO RIGHT NOW BACK AT UTD
OH GOOD WELL I'M GLAD YOU LIBERATION
WELL THE MAIN THING WAS UH WHAT IS THAT YOU WANT TO STUDY AND UH WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO GET WHAT YOU NEED AND
HOW FAR IS IT FROM HOME I- I HAD TO PUT EVEN THEN AND THEN COURSE WE ALSO THAT INCLUDE HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE UM
UM-HUM
HUM
WELL YOU HAVE TO BE PRACTICAL BECAUSE UH I KNOW UM ARE THERE ARE FIRST DAUGHTER WENT TO THE STEPHEN F AUSTIN
AND UH HER ALLERGIES ACTED UP IN THE PINEY WOODS AND IT WAS TOO FAR FROM HOME AND SHE GOT LAWNS AND AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR HER SO I GUESS I LEARNED ON THAT ONE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
THE LAUNDRY AND FOOD I THINK THE FOOD HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT
YEAH MY THEY'RE DOING THE LAUNDRY  ESPECIALLY WITH THE BOYS THE GIRLS OF THEM SEEN THE LAUNDRY ISN'T THAT QUITE THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO KNOW ENOUGH TO HANDLE THAT BETTER BUT THE BOYS THAT SAID LAUNDRY IT FROZE THEM THERE FOR A WHILE
EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW HOW TO USE THE WASHING MACHINE TO
HUM
WELL WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE PAST P- I GUESS I DO YOU HAVE UH A MORE THAN THE ONE DAUGHTER TO PLAN FOR UH
OH OKAY
UM-HUM UM
THAT'S GOOD DO YOU FIND THAT UH THE BOY IS GOING INTO DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND THEN THE GIRL AS FAR AS WHAT IS UH UM NEEDS ARE THE TYPE OF COLLEGE MORE
WELL YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UH
RIGHT NOW BOTH SORRY HE HAS GOOD TRACK RECORD HOW COME AROUND AND IT'S UH
OKAY TAKE OUR TOPIC IS BUDGETS
DO YOU KEEP A MONTHLY BUDGET
UH-HUH
HUH INTERESTING
OH
WELL THAT IT JUST LIKE THE MONEY IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF IT IS IT'S A IT'S A GOOD IS THAT WHAT WHAT
I'M A TEACHER AND CREDITS MY HUSBAND IRS STATION LIFE WHERE WE'VE GOT ONE LEFT IN COLLEGE
SO BUDGETING IS NOT OUR PRIORITIES SINCE WE HAVE ONE IN COLLEGE THAT THEY THEIR EXPENSES RUN BEYOND ANY BUDGETING ALLOWANCES
WE'VE QUIT
YEAH
OKAY I SEE I STOPPED THOSE FOUR YEARS AGO REALLY YEAH
YEAH OH YEAH NOW WE OR YOU KNOW UM WELL WE'RE AT A POINT LIFE THAT THROUGH LOOKING TO RETIREMENT RATHER THAN YOU KNOW ON THINGS
SO IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE UM YOU KNOW HAVE AUTOMATIC TELLER I ONLY HAVE THE PARK AND IT WAS ON MY OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNT AND IT GOT WAY OUT OF CONTROL VERY FAST
SO I HAVE A TENDENCY NOW I TAKE IT WHILE IT'S
AND WHEN IT'S ON IT IT'S GONE UP YOU KNOW I FINISHED IF IT'S GOT THE FIFTIES AND THE MONTHS THEN IT'S IT'S GONE
AND UM WE HAVE A TENDENCY NOT TO USE CASH WE TAKE EVERYTHING A CHECK
AND SO THAT WAY WE KEEP CONTROL OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING WHERE IT'S GOING WHAT IT'S GOING FOR
SO UM YOU KNOW I- I TAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO I TECH AND YOU KNOW I MEAN I DON'T LIKE GROCERIES THAT THAT IT'S MY OWN LITTLE
SLUSH FUND IF YOU WANNA CALL IT THAT AND THAT'S WHERE MY LITTLE INCIDENTALS THEIR READING TO THE GROCERY STORE TO GET IT YOU KNOW DOWN THE MILK OR WHATEVER
BUT UM I HAVE TWO THAT CHECK ONLY
SO WE CAN YOU KNOW REALLY KNOW WHERE OUR MONEY'S GOING AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
WELL THAT'S HOW ARE YOU ON CHARGE CARDS
BUT
YEAH
OKAY
UH
OKAY YOU KNOW SO THAT MIGHT HELP YOU COULD SEE MY HUSBAND TRAVELS AS WELL
AND WE HAVE SET THE CAR TO CAMP
HE'S GOT AN AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THAT THE ONLY TRAVELING
THEN WE BOTH HAVE A VISA OR MASTERCARD
SO ANY CNN AMERICAN EXPRESS IS HE IS
AND IT'S HIS EXPENSE NOW HE GAVE ME ONE DAY IF I GO WITH HIM ON WORK
I ONLY CHARGED ON THAT CARD I DON'T PUT IT ON MY MASTERCARD
SO WE'VE SEPARATED THOSE TWO COMPLETELY AND I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BECAUSE AT FIRST WE STAYED INTERMINGLE OUR FUNDS AND WE WEREN'T SURE  MARQUEE ELSEWHERE OUTRAGEOUS
YES
UH I TALK ABOUT DOING THAT A LOT
UH I- I USE A A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL EXPENSES PRIMARILY IT'S A CHECKING
YOU KNOW CHECK BOUNCING PROGRAM BUT IT DOES CAT OR CATEGORIZE EVERYTHING
AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO EITHER TO GO IN AND CREATE A BUDGET AND THEN COMPARE AGAINST IT OR ACTUALLY WELL SORT OF GENERATE ONE BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW YOU CATEGORIZE THINGS OVER THE OVER THE MONTHS
SO I HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY'RE UH JUST THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN VERY DILIGENT IT IT REALLY CRACKING IT AND ON A YEAR
RIGHT RIGHT WHAT DO YOU DO
OKAY
UM-HUM
RIGHT
THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD
UM SO THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT I'VE HAD OUR ONE OF ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS UH
KEEPING TRACK OF CASH AND YOU EXPENDITURES
UH I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS IS UH MAKES BUDGETING VERY HARD IS THE CONVENIENCE OF AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINES
UH AND ABILITY TO GO UP AND GET CASH SO EASILY
OH REALLY
OKAY WELL SEE YOU HAVE CONTROL
UM-HUM
OKAY
HUH
WELL THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
UH-HUH
IT'S GONE HUH WELL THAT'S GREAT
RIGHT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT
UM-HUM WELL THAT'S GREAT
OH WOW
UM-HUM YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UP PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THAT UH THAT THE LAST FEW YEARS ANYWAY WE DID HAVE A MASTER CARD THAT GOT OUT OF HAND FOR A WHILE BUT WE JUST YOU STOP USING IT DIDN'T GET RID OF IT
THERE ARE TIMES THAT'S SUCH IS STROKES A MAIL ORDER TYPE THINGS UH W- VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE
UH BUT THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY THING IS USED FOR AND UH ONE ONE PAW DO HAVE IS WITH UM
IS THAT I EAT IN MY JOB I TRAVEL A GOOD BIT AND HAVE TO USE MY OWN A CREDIT CARD I DON'T HAVE A BUSINESS CREDIT CARD
SO I USE THAT AND THEN HAVE TO FILE EXPENSE REPORTS AND UH
IT JUST HAD ANOTHER COMPLICATION TO PROPERLY <UNK> TRACKING EXPENSES KNOWING HOW MUCH O- IS REIMBURSE BUSINESS EXPENSES
UH HOW MUCH IS MY OWN EXPENSE FOR
YEAH I- I USE UH CREDIT CARDS NOT FOR CREDIT BUT FOR CONVENIENCE M- I PAY UM WE PAY MONTHLY BALANCE DO UH IT WOULD
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD LEARNING TO ME
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OKAY
RIGHT
UM-HUM
SURE OH YEAH IT'S HARD TO BE SMART TO INSURE
RIGHT
OKAY WELL I THINK THAT THAT SAID THAT MY MIND WHAT KIND OF MINE THAT HA- I HAVE THINKING BACK FOR A LONG TIME
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UH-HUH

OH REALLY
IT'S HARD TO SHARE
NO WELL
UM-HUM AND IT'S A PAINTED  YOU KNOW IT'S
I BUY THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY ANYTHING TO DO THERE
I- I- I THINK THEY DO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T BUY THEIR WARRANTIES EITHER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WHEN IT'S THAT OLD THEY'RE GOING TO BUY ANYONE
SO
YEAH MY HUSBAND REALLY GOOD SIXTEEN THINGS TOO SO HE USUALLY YOU BE ABLE TO FIX ANYTHING THAT MINOR IN UH-HUH

I THINK THAT IT'S THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN UH I WAS NEWLY MARRIED FAMILY WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT I THINK WE VEERED WHERE THE FAMILY
WHAT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT UNIT AND I THINK NOW IT'S RESOLVING BACK FULL CIRCLE I THINK THE FAMILY UNIT IS BECOMING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS
THAT'S TRUE  WELL I KNOW THAT ECONOMICALLY UH I WATCH ALMOST HAVE TO WORK ANYMORE
AND YET I'M ALSO ANOTHER THING UM
ANY AREAS THAT I'M WORKING AT THAT MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE WANTING OUT TO STAY HOME WITH THE CHILDREN WHERE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THEY DIDN'T I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY WANTED CHILDREN BUT THEY STILL WANT TO BE THEIR OWN PERSON OUT IN THE WORK FORCE
BUT I SEE I SEEN WOMEN NOW WANTING TO STAY HOME MORE AT LEAST UNTIL THE CHILDREN ARE UP TO YOU KNOW SCHOOL AGE

OVER THE RUMOR IS IS IS THEY WILL HAPPEN THEY HAVE TO NEXT TIME SO
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH UH
EXCEPT THAT THE RUMOR IS IS THAT THEY STILL MIGHT BUT IT MAY NOT INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CREW AND IT WILL BE A NEXT GENERATION MEETS THIS GENERATION
SO
I THINK IT'S A HUNDRED YEARS
SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE
CONSIDERING THAT SPOCK WAS ON AND UH YOU KNOW COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND AND THAT THE THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF NEXT GENERATION THEY HAD A COIT
YEAH UM-HUM YEAH WELL YOU KNOW IS LIKE A REREAD MOL- WHATEVER YOU KNOW AND HE'S CAN HOLD ON THE WHOLE REAL SLOW BULLPEN AGE A LOT BETTER

WELL YOU KNOW WHY

REALLY HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE BOX BEFORE
ALL RIGHT BECAUSE IN MY OPINION I I'M STILL A STUDENT RIGHT NOW AND I'M I SHE STAYED IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION I THINK THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS TODAY
UM ONE ANYTHING I JUST LEAVE THE STUDENTS WERE TAUGHT TO LEARN WHAT THE TEACHER WANTS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY I'M GETTING A FURTHER VANTAGE POINT
AND SO IT'S BASICALLY WERE TAUGHT TO BE MEDIOCRE AND WHAT WE LEARNED
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT'S REALLY IS A REALLY NEAT FIELD I UH WORK RIGHT NOW IN A SPECIAL SOME FREEBIES CHILDREN AND FOR SOME OF THE LEARNING DISABLED
AND IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW THAT THEY CAN LEARN QUICKLY IF YOU JUST FIND WHAT TRIED FOR THEM
AND I THINK LIKE YOU SAID AT LEAST IN MY TEN I THINK THEY PUT A LOT RESTRICTIONS ON TEACHERS OF HOW THEY CAN TEACH THEM YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
I THINK IT'S REAL INTERESTING TO I THINK ALONG WITH THE SPECIAL CHILDREN I HAVE A FRIEND WHOSE GIFTED AND IN SCHOOL WHO TROUBLE IS ALL THOSE YEARS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE EVER CHALLENGE MORE OF A FOUND WHAT EXACTLY WAS WHAT HE NEEDED IN TERMS OF LEARNING
AND I THINK AGAIN IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE SAME THING IF YOU KNOW BEING MEDIOCRE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO
UM-HUM
RIGHT
I THINK ABSOLUTE CORRECT
YOU KNOW I THINK PERSON LIKE YOU SAID IT IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE TEACHERS COMING OUT OF THEIR SHOWN ON BEING AFRAID TO MAKE MISTAKES INSANE I AM A SHED IT'S IF IT WORKS GREAT IF IT DOESN'T APOLOGIZE
AND I I FOUND IN MY OWN SCHOOL IN THAT ONE THE TEACHERS MAY THAT SPECIAL EFFORT TO TO MAKE THE CLASSICS IN TO MAKE A DIFFERENT TO TO CHALLENGE MIND SELECTED TO TO BRING ABOUT INTO FROM METHODIST TEACHING I WAS A LOT MORE INTERESTED IN LEARNING
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT BEING SYSTEMS AND AND HOW THOSE WORK
UH-HUH
UM-HUM

AND I SAID YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TOO REAL ANYMORE I HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT IN MY OWN LAW STATES IN WHAT I- WHAT HAPPY FANTASY LIKE
UH-HUH
UH IT
I I DO MY SHARE OF IT'S I- I- I CERTAINLY CAN'T SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF IT
WELL MAYBE NOT HAVING JUST THROW OUT
THAT A LITTLE TIRED OF ONE OF THE BIGGER CITIES
OH I- I TALKED TO SOMEONE THAT WAS UH A COUPLE OF THOUSAND HER TOWN UH-HUH RIGHT
YEAH I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE TOWN
UH WELL ANYWAY I WISH LIST OF EDUCATION I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME IDEAS AND SOME STUDYING IN THEM COLLEGE
I'D SAY THE FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THE BASIC READING WRITING WITH ME TOO
GRADE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY REALLY TEACH ABOUT FORTY PERCENT LESS THAN THEY USED TO AND SHOWS UP
THAT'S WHAT I DO YOU HAVE ANY
UM-HUM
YEAH IT PLANO UM PRO- GREATLY NO LAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT'S FOR SURE USED AS A PET
AN ARLINGTON IS EXCELLENT NOW BUT I'M JUST SPEAKING OVERALL CROSS COUNTRY SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY DO AT HOME
AND UH ONE THING THEY DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME
JUST TEACHING READING AND WRITING SO A LOT OF KIDS ADJUSTING PROMOTED FROM YOUR HERE IN THEIR TRULY CAN'T READ
SO I HAVE EXPECT THEM TO UH PASS
HISTORY WHEN I CAN'T READ ANYTHING YOU KNOW YOU READ A WORD PROBABLY NOW
SO UM THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM NOW THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE NOT GONNA KEEP SMARTER PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM TOO LONG PAYING THE WAGES THEY DO
BUT UM
WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT WELL DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE THERE ALSO DIFFERENCE ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES THERE'S NO NATIONAL CURRICULUM YOU KNOW
UH MAINLY WHAT THEY BE TEACHING IN ARLINGTON SCHOOL THEY MIGHT BE TEACHING IN THE PLANO SCHOOL AND AND THE VERY SAME
SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU MAKE EVEN IN ARLINGTON SEVENTH GRADE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE
AN- ENGLISH CLASS YOU MAY HAVE HAVE POLLUTER FOR THE WHOLE YEAR OR IS ANOTHER ONE THAT GOT CAUGHT STRAIGHTEN GRAMMAR GIVE YOU LITTLE INTEREST UP TO THE TEACHER IN OTHER WORDS
SO THAT'S KIND OF A- YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ODD TO ME
IT DEPENDS ON UM
WHAT SCHOOL YEAR IN IN WHO TEACHERS ACTUALLY
UH OR THE BODY AND UH  OH WELL ARLINGTON IS GOOD FOR THE BETTER ONES IN THE STATE SO I GUESS WE LOOKED AT WOMEN TOO YEAH
UM-HUM OF COURSE WE HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM IN THAT UH A NUMBER OF DEAL LETTER IT IN AMERICA IS MUSHROOMING
AT THIS POINT AND UM YOU KNOW WALK IT MIGHT BE A GREAT SCHOOL WE'RE STILL PAYING OFF A LOT OF TAXES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON WELFARE UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T READ YOU KNOW
SO
I DON'T KNOW I JUST READ ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY AND I HAD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF IT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE SOMETIMES
I LIKE THE THIRD GRADE TEACHER WILL GET KIDS FROM SECOND GRADE IT DIDN'T EVEN LEARN WHAT THEY UM THEY SHOULD TO DO THE WORK THAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO TEACH YOU KNOW
OH THAT AND UH I'M GOING TO HER PLANS AND SO I GUESS IF THERE WAS A NATIONAL CURRICULUM AT LEAST HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT ALL KIDS WOULD LINE
BUT UM WE ACTUALLY RANK FORTY NINTH IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS JUST PLAIN LITERACY GOES YOU KNOW
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY LOW THAT THERE'S FORTY EIGHT COUNTRIES AHEAD OF US TO HAVE MORE PAID MORE CITIZENS PERCENTAGEWISE YOU CAN REASON RIGHT
SO UM
THAT'S THE ONE KEEPING AND
PAYING FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T MAKE IT INSIDE WHO HAD TO DO SOMETHING
YEAH
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAD TO CUT OUT SOME OF THIS BALL ROLL STEPPING GO BACK IN THE FIRST FIVE SIX GRADE AND JUST KEEP GOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND SO MOST OF THOSE ARE CAPABLE CAN LEAST LEARN TO REDO RIGHT
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THEM MUSIC
JOB WITHOUT BEING GREEK SOMETHING NOWADAYS
YOU KNOW
UM
MAKING BUT YOU CAN EVEN WORK AN ANSWERING MACHINE AND IF YOU WERE AT WORK AND I HAD IT TO GET A MESSAGE ARE SO YOU KNOW IF THEY RUN APPLICATION TO WORK AT MCDONALD'S IS TO GET RAISED
SO UM I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A START AT LEAST GOING BACK TO THE BASICS IN THE EARLY GRADE
HM
AND UM
THEY SAY THAT THE AVERAGE ENGLISH DO NOWADAYS DOES AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT LET'S READING WRITING AND THEY DID TWENTY YEARS AGO
THAT'S A BIG JUMP
YEAH DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN PLANO
TO THE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL
AND
UM IT'S NOT WHEN THE BIGGER ONES IT'S PROBABLY UM
I COMPARE IT TOO THE SIZE OF PLANO THEY THEY'LL SMALLER
AND
OH REALLY

WHICH ONE THING LEAD TO ANOTHER
YOU KNOW VISUALLY WE END UP REPLACING ALL THE PIPES
FROM THE SINK HER BACK TO THE MAIN DRAIN WHICH MAKES YOU TAKE THE WALL OUT AND START ALL OVER
WHO WAS THE ONE OF THOSE

EVERYTHING AND THERE WAS COPPER AND WAS ALL SOLDERED
THAT'S WHAT DROVE ME BANANAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO THE HARDWARE STORE SING IN A PLASTIC PIPE AND A HALF
YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT
TO FIT IN TOGETHER ENOUGH IN ONE TO GO SO IT WAS LIKE I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MAIN DURING THE START ALL OVER
REALLY

DID YOU UH REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE CAMPAIGN
UM-HUM
YOU'D HAVE TO MIX PAINT THEN RIGHT
OKAY
UM-HUM YEAH
YEAH WHICH ONLY HAD ONE CAMPAIGNS THAT YOU HEAR THE ENTIRE ROOM
HAVE THAT GO
KIND OF FUN AND UH
REALLY
REPEATING PATTERNS WHICH IS A CHECK FOR WHEN YOU BUY YOUR PAPER
YEAH
NORMALLY IT'LL TOW A ON A ROLL HOW OFTEN A PATTERN REPEATS
YEAH
HUM
UH WE DID YOU PAY PRINTED YOU START IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL
OR JUST STARTED HE IS
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I'VE HAD MY BEST LUCK AND PAPER AND WHEN I START IN THE MIDDLE OF A WALL YOU KNOW OR WITH A PLUM ON
AND START IN THE MIDDLE OF A WALL AND AND GO FROM THERE
AND BOY AROUND THE ROOM
WELL YOU YOU
WELL DOWN HERE AND WE'VE GOT UH
TRIAL BY A JURY IN CRIMINAL CASES WORM SENTENCING CAN BE DONE BY THE
JURY NORMALLY ALL THE JUDGE AND SOMETIMES THOSE ARE ALL THE OTHER
WELL A LOT OF THE IN FRONT OF COURSE THEY HAVE THOSE UNIFORM SENTENCING
GUIDELINES IT PRETTY WELL LEAVE IT UP TO THE UH JUDGE DECIDE PUNISHMENT SURGEON RANGE
RIGHT HERE IN THE DALLAS AREA IF YOU WERE SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS OR LESS INCARCERATION IN THE UH PENITENTIARY
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT AS A PENITENTIARY US OUR BODY YEAR IN THE COUNTY JAILS AND WE REALLY THE THE JAIL OVERCROWDING
WELL THE JUDGE HAS A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT IS
PROBLEM RANGES ABOUT PARTICULAR TOP WALL AND WERE JURIES SITTING AT ONE TIME
REALLY IN CIVIL CASES THEY CAN HAVE A FEW IS TEN OF THE JURORS REMEMBERED IT WITH CRIMINAL KNOWN REQUIRES UNANIMOUS
AND I MAKE A CHANGE ON THAT UM I MAKE SURE MISTRAL
COURSE IN CIVIL CASES TRIAL BY JURY DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK AT A REAL BIG COMPLEX A LITTLE BUSINESS TOPIC A'S WERE DREW COULD GET TOTALLY LOST
MOST CASES PEOPLE DECIDED JUST THROW THE CASE BEFORE THE JUDGE AND IT'S NOT HAVE A JURY
DO YOU HAVE UP THERE AND WHAT KIND OF A CASE THAT LADY WHO POISONING HER VERY SO SOME OF THE BLANCHARD OR
RIGHT YEAH
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THAT
AND UM I REMEMBER UH
WITHOUT A GOOD CAREER WOMAN IS ACCUSED OF PORK HIS WIFE WITH ARSENIC THAN THE JURY THE KIDS WENT TO THE JURY TODAY INJURIES LIBERTY RIGHT NOW
REAL COLLECTOR WITHIN THE JURY USUALLY PEROT
UH WE USUALLY DO IT UH THE JURY COMES TO THE VERDICT AND THEN THE JUDGE DOES THE SENTENCING
UM I THINK THE JURY CAN RECOMMEND SOMETHING BUT
IN THIS YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES LIKE UH MURDER AND THE FIRST DEGREE BUT UH THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS IS THE DECISION OF THE JUDGE ONCE IT
VERDICT HAS BEEN REACH THE JURIES DISMISSED
AND THERE'S A SEPARATE HEARING FOR SENTENCING
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK IT'S CURIOUS THAT UH THE SENTENCE IS BETTER HANDED DOWN I USUALLY NOT SERVED
I THINK THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT
YEAH
OH WELL I I UNDERSTAND THE JAIL OVERCROWDING ISSUE BUT UM
I- I THINK IN IN THAT CASE IT IS AND SO MANY AT ALL THEY EVER DO IS DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS AND THEY NEVER DO ANYTHING TO FALL
I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF COUNTRIES IN THE STATE THAT THEN NOW BUT I I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT A JURY
SHOULD DO THE SENTENCING I
YEAH I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THE JURORS HAVE THE
THE KNOWLEDGE THIS GROUP OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO SIT HANDLED SOMETHING WE'RE AT THE JUDGE TO
THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE
I JUST UH UH I- I DON'T AGREE WITH JURIES DOING THE SENTENCING BUT I DO AGREE WITH TRIALS TRIAL BY JURY I JUST THINK THAT'S CRITICAL
RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT CAN THAT MAKES SENSE TO BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE AWFULLY HARD TO PICK
JURORS THAT COULD FOLLOWS SOMETHING THAT'S AND THAT'S CIVIL CASE I MEAN THAT WAS REALLY COMPLICATED AND HAVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ISSUES IN IT BUT THEY UH THEY'RE A LOT OF CRIMINAL CASES A LOT OF MURDER CASES AND
THAT THAT ARE REALLY VERY COMPLICATED THEY SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THOSE
THE LAST TEN OR MORE
YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE YOU HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT TRIAL WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON NOW WITH THE UH
THE MAN THAT'S ACCUSED OF MOLESTING TWENTY THREE CHILDREN IN A DAY CARE CENTER
WELL THAT'S THE UH THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHILD MOLESTATION CASES IN THAT AND THE NATIONS HISTORY
THIS MAN AND HIS WIFE SAID IT'S A TRIAL BY JURY BUT IT'S REALLY GO IN REAL RAG IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE DOING THAT
AND THEY GET MI- HE HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT CHARGES AGAINST HIM
AND HIS ATTORNEYS MANAGED TO GET IT REDUCES NINETY THREE
BUT THE JURY IN THAT CASE THEY JUST ABSOLUTELY SEQUESTERED UM
NOBODY EVEN IN LESS YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION AT THE VERY BEGINNING YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES AND THEY I I FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING IN THE PAPER THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WERE GONNA
DO THE SENTENCING IN THAT
OUR SNAKE IS UH THIS THIS PLACE TENOR MORMON WAS VERY CLEVER SHE DID IT VERY SLOWLY OVER A LARGE PERIOD LONG PERIOD OF TIME AT LEAST IT WAS
IT WE'VE DONE VERY SLOWLY OVER LARGE PERIOD OF TIME
AND SINCE THE JURY HUSBAND
FOUND HER GUILTY NOW THE JUDGE DID THE SENTENCING AND THAT AND SHE'S APPEALING BUT
I'M ASSUMING THAT SHE'S GUILTY BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE JURY SYSTEM
YEAH HOPEFULLY THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH NOT TO BE A GOOD WAY TO BUY
BOY SCOUT I MEAN DO YOU DO YOU BACKPACK IN PART CAMP
MY SON'S TWELVE AND HE'S IN THE BOY SCOUT AND HE WENT ON HIS FIRST BACKPACK FIVE MILES I'M GONE WITH THEM HOME UH SOME OF THE SCIENCE WERE W-

THAN THAN JUST A W- BECAUSE I AM NOT JUST THE WAY THAT I W- I I'M GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF MY DAUGHTERS IN LAS AT THIS TIME OR WORKING
OKAY THE CHANGE HOW AND WOMEN'S ROLES HAVE CHANGED
I WELL I THINK WE'VE MOVED OUT OF THE STEREOTYPE BUSY HOMEMAKER UH AND I THINK IT'S BEEN THROUGH THE SAME CITY
WITH THE ECONOMY AND WITH THE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES
WELL
I UH POSSIBLY YOU KNOW IF IF THEY'RE DOING IT SIMPLY UM
BIG BEFORE THE MONEY I THINK YOU KNOW THAT
IF IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO FILL THEMSELVES AND THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT TOO
THAT UH THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AND THE QUOTE HOMEMAKERS ROW SHOULD BE DECIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE PARTNERS
UH-HUH  THAT'S RIGHT
AND OF COURSE NOW WOMEN CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TOO
UH ONE THING THAT HAS NOT CHANGED HIS
USE EQUALITY OF SPA- AMONG THE SIXES
AND UH I DON'T SEE ANY GREAT WHOLE FOR THAT BEING CHANGED INTO THE NEAR FUTURE QUITE FRANKLY
WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE DECISIONS
UH THE SENATE AND I HEALTH CARE PRIMARILY MAIL UM-HUM

YOU KNOW THE THE BIG DECISION MAKER TO STEAL MAIL UNTIL WE GET THAT CHANGED YOU KNOW I'M A SINGLE
PARENT WELL A SINGLE PERSON MY CHILDREN ARE ARE GROWN MARRIED THAT UH I STILL HAVE TO SUPPORT MYSELF

WELL I DIDN'T I DIDN'T WORK WELL MY CHILDREN WERE YOUNG AND I WAS MARRIED BECAUSE I DID WANT TO GIVE THEM THE BACKGROUND THAT THEY GOT IT HOME I DID FIND AFTERWARDS SO
YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN WHO'S YOU KNOW AND I YOU KNOW SHALL SEE FAMILY WHICH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN SHE IS IT'S IT'S HELPING FAMILIES ANYMORE UM BUT I DID FIND THAT THE CHILDREN OF WORKING PARENTS
ARE WORKING PARENTS UH WERE MORE INDEPENDENT
AND MAYBE THAT GOES TO WEAR BREAK IT BREAKING DOWN THE FAMILY BONDS BUT I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY FAMILIES THAT W- THE WOMEN REALLY WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
UH MOST OF THEM
ARE WORKING AND IT'S NOT TO BUY THE TVS AND THE NEW CARS IT'S TO SURVIVE
WELL EVEN YOU KNOW HERE OUR TEACHERS ARE PAID SO POORLY
YEAH AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY TEACHERS WHOSE WIFE IT'S NOT HAVING TO WORK
SO IT'S IT'S NOT JUST THE MAN THAT OUT OF COLLEGE EDUCATION IT'S
I THINK IT'S REALLY THAT'S RIGHT AND I'M HOME A REAL BAD
YES
WELL I'LL COME HOME I- IS CERTAINLY IN THE RECESSION
UH WE'VE BEEN THERE IF WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT THREE TO FIVE YEARS NOW AND IT'S REALLY HURTING

AND IT JUST TO ME THAT SEEMS REALLY SAD
UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S KIND OF A CHALLENGE I GUESS
YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THE BIG THING IS JUST TO FIND A NURSING HOME THEY REALLY CARES OF OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES THE MONEY THEY'RE BRINGING BUT IT'S IT'S MORE HUMANITARIAN THING WHERE THEY WON ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE THE BEST YEARS UH LIFE THAT ARE LEFT
AND I THINK THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM PERSONALLY

WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT  YEAH THEY JUST DIDN'T IT IT PERHAPS AND THEN TRY AND SOME HOUSE SUBSIDIZE IT IN A WEIGHT IT'S MORE FAIR
YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE USUALLY DO THEIR YOUR COMPANY OR

IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW IF THEY ALWAYS ARE AND IT WAS A DECENT JOB YOU KNOW STITCHING THIS TERRIBLE I THINK THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO JUST PLAY ON THE GAME
UM-HUM
NO WE DON'T HAVE BEEN TO ONE OF THE NORDSTROMS AND UH I ENJOY WORKING
NICE STORE
DO YOU REALLY
DO YOU HAVE MORE DETAIL THERE
UM I'VE WE'RE ORIGINALLY FROM SAINT LOUIS WE CAME DOWN TO DALLAS AND UH THEY'VE LEARNED TAYLORS HERE AND I KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF THEIR HOUSE BRANDS AND I HAVE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF SOME THE HOUSE BRANCHES <UNK> THE STORES
THIS NORDSTROMS CARRY THEIR OWN HOUSE IN
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
DO YOU SHOP IN YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT
IT'S NOT
UM-HUM
THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I SEE BECAUSE UH MY SISTER GET TONS OF CATALOGS AND PASSES THEM ON TO ME I LOOK AT THINGS AND THEY HAVE SOME GORGEOUS CLOSER TO THE PROBLEM IS THAT
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BY SIZES YOU KNOW HE'LL GO TO A DEPARTMENT STORE AND TRY AND THREE DIFFERENT SIZES AND THREE GIFTED MANUFACTURES AND THEY ALL SAID YOU KNOW DIFFERENT MAKES BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAIN THING IS THAT I CAN'T TELL US
WHETHER THE THINGS GOING TO SEE IT OR NOT
AND SO I TEND NOT TO MAIL ORDER
GOSH
I
WELL PERSONALLY I ALWAYS TRY ON BEFORE IT BY ANYWAY I JUST S- IT AMAZES ME WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT THEY BUY A L- LIKE TO BUY A BUNCH OF CLOTHES AND THEY DON'T TRY ANYTHING ON A KID
OH OKAY WELL THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY RIGHT
I HEAR ABOUT THAT TOO THAT JUST APPALLS ME I MEAN THAT'S FEELING REALLY
REALLY
YOU KNOW I JUST DIDN'T LAST WEEK AS A MATTER OF FACT UM I WONDER IF THEY'RE SUBJECT IS MORE UM PRODUCTS BUYING YELLOW THINGS YOU BUY AT THE STORE BUT UM
THAT'S SOMETHING THROUGH THE MAIL SURE MERCHANT DREW COMPANIES IT'S GENERALLY GET PRETTY GOOD PRIDE ACCIDENT
THAT WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THEY HANDLE THE RETURN POLICY BASE AND UPS TOO OUR DOOR TO TAKE IT OUT FREE OF CHARGE WHICH IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL FOR US THAT'S GOOD
POST OFFICE IS A PLACE TO RETURN IT USUALLY
IT WAS HIS ANDERSON THE CHILDREN'S UM CLOTHING
DO THEY
IT REALLY IS
IT'S A WHILE BECAUSE IT WAS THE HOLIDAY WEEKS UM
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHEN THE PERSON WAS GOING ARRIVE WHAT WERE FORCED INTO MY HUSBAND WORKS MOST THE TIME OUT OF OUR HOME SO HE'S HERE BUT
IT WOULD'VE PROBABLY THAT INCONVENIENT AND IF IT HAD BEEN HOME PICK UP AND AND WE HAD BEEN HERE BUT THERE ALSO WANTED TO GO TO WORK
IT DOESN'T RETURN FOR THE SAME THING ON THE LARGER SIZE BUT IT SEEMED TO DO WITH SUITS D- UH AROUND THE CALLERS THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD TIME SHE WORE IT IN THE DIFFERENT
AND AND I THINK THAT'S UNUSUAL FOR THAT COMPANY BECAUSE THEY DO USUALLY HAVE PRETTY GOOD PRICE BUT DID A ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WE WERE OPPOSED TO ABOUT WHEN THINGS CAN BE POOR QUALITY I THINK DEFINITELY I THINK A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT UM
OR NOT NECESSARILY LITTLE PRICE TAG <UNK> MANUFACTURED FOR LIKE CASES IS IF YOU WERE LOWER PRICED
UM-HUM
YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH AND IT IT'S UNFORTUNATE YOU REALLY CANNOT DEPEND ON THE THE DEPARTMENT STORES NEED FOR THAT NECESSARILY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE NORDSTROMS IN DALLAS
UM-HUM
REALLY NICE STORES AND I THINK I ASSUME THAT YOU CAN THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY COULD CARRY OVERALL PRETTY GOOD MERCHANDISE YOU YOU HAVE TO BE JUST AS CAREFUL THERE IS TO DO IT ANY OTHER LOWER PRICE STORE
YOU KNOW SURPRISINGLY
NO
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT I BET THEY PROBABLY DO BUT I I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S
ASSOCIATED SOME OF WHAT I SEE JUST LIKE THEY ALWAYS CARRY THEIR OWN RENDER JUST SOME OF THESE UM GOTTEN IT AT A LOWER UM PRICE BECAUSE IT'S A LARGE VOLUME OF THEIR CHILDREN
I TEND TO LOOK US KIDS THINGS BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY THEY SOMETIMES HAVE THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T FIND ELSEWHERE DOES HAVE A PRETTY LARGE VARIETY NOT OFTEN FOR MYSELF
ACTUALLY I I DO I THINK BEFORE I HAD A CHILD AND BECAUSE YOU END UP PAYING FOR THAT SHE COULDN'T HANDLE AND EVERYTHING UM
AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE CONVENIENCE OF FOR TURNING IF IT'S NOT RIGHT UM I I TEND LESS OFTEN TO DO THAT TODAY THAN I AM I JUST TEN YEARS AGO
UM-HUM

YEAH THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH TYPE PROGRAM YEAH THAT'S ONE THAT'S THE ONE THING'S CERTAIN SO THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO THINGS THAT REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WHEN THE LOCAL PEOPLE GET INVOLVED AND WHEN THEY START DOING SOMETHING POSITIVE WITH FAMILIES AND WAS GONNA PUT IN THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS

SEEMS TO BE THAT WAY I- IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER NO THAT GO FOR ANY KIND OF LIKED PSYCHIATRIC HELP NOT EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE GOT PLANNED ON YOUR PARENTS
AND THAT TO ME THAT'S JUST DEFEATING THE FAMILY RIGHT THERE
AND IF YOU CAN UH
YEAH
UH
YOU KNOW OUT OF MY OWN FAMILY I BECAUSE I GUESS MAYBE I DIDN'T HAVE EVERYTHING I WANTED WHEN I WAS GROWING UP BUT I'VE I'VE I'VE GOTTEN OLDER OF LEARN TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT I GOT WHAT I NEEDED I WAS CLOTHING SHELTERED AND EDUCATED AND
I HAVEN'T REALLY BE MY FUTURE PROBLEMS SO ON ON THE FAMILY UPBRINGING OR WHATEVER
UH
IT'S JUST A ACT LIKE I CAN EVER IMAGINE MY SON COMMITTING THE CRIME UH
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S UM IT'S IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN IN HIS WORLD BUT THE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES AND AND SMALL CRIMES AND THINK NOT ENOUGH THAT IT'S
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
SO LITTLE YOURS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT'S A BIG CONTRIBUTOR I THINK WOMEN HAVE UH REALLY
UH BEGUN TO PENETRATE A LOT OF FIELDS THAT WERE DOMINATED BY MID FOR CENTURIES
OH YEAH
UH-HUH WELL I THINK YOU UM
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAS BEEN THE UH PENETRATION OF A LOT OF THESE FIELDS POWER WOMEN AND  I THINK
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE UM AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT NOW FOR
SOME IN IN A LOT OF WOMEN I THINK UH
IT'S GOING TO BRING VERY GOOD THINGS AND UH WE'RE GONNA BE A LOT BETTER OFF THE SOCIETY AS A CONTINUES BUT IT'S PAINFUL TRANSITION
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF ATTITUDE THAT HAVE TO CHANGE I GUESS THAT'S THE BIG THING
YOU KNOW AS PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDES THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE WOMEN UM PARTICIPATING IN SEQUEL PARTNERS
IN OUR SOCIETY IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN AND HISTORY WILL RECORDED THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA AND UH
NO I I'M NOT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU NEED A HILL TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE AND
UM NO NOT SURPRISED BY THAT ALL WE HAVE A WE HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD MY WIFE UH WORKS OUT OF THE HOME UM AND UH
UH I THINK JUST LOOKING AT HOW A HU- UH VIEWS DIFFER FROM THOSE ARE MOTHER GENERATION BEFORE
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY CHANGING ATTITUDES AND UM DO YOU NOT LIKE THE SA- CITY IN THE POLITICAL CHANGES AS YOU POINTED OUT ARE GONNA MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE I THINK
UH IT'S A PAINFUL TRANSITION BOUGHT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BIG STEP FOR HUMAN TIME THAT I THINK UH IT'S IT'S REAL PROGRESS BUT THEY'RE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT A TWO TO HAVE TO CHANGE AND I I GUESS ENTERING THE QUESTION THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY I'D SAY
IS THAT OVERALL IT'S JUST THE ATTITUDE OF MEN AND WOMEN TO WORK EQUAL PARTICIPATION AND EQUAL PAY AN EQUAL POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS FOR WOMEN BECAUSE
THAT'S REALLY GONNA BE BETTER FOR EVERYBODY ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THREATENED BY THAT HAS IS REFLECTED IN WHAT GOES ON
YEAH I
WELL I THINK I THINK BOTH
YEAH BOTH ATTITUDES HAVE TO CHANGE AND I THINK UH
UM IT'S IT'S A EVIDENT TO ME AS I LOOK AT ALL THE TELEVISION SHOWS THAT NOW FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN UH WATCHING ROSEANNE LAST NIGHT WATCHING
UH SHOW THE PURSUED IT AT HOME IMPROVEMENTS ALL THESE TELEVISION SHOWS WHICH REACHED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEING REFLECT NEW ATTITUDES AND DOES IT
WELL I'M NOT ONLY I MEAN WHAT HAVE YOU HAD TO HAVE A FACTOR THE MATTER IS THAT WOMEN HAVE HAVE CARRIED MORE THAN THEIR WEIGHT AND THEY'RE STILL DOING THAT AND
UM I SEE I THINK IT'S JUST PART OF A PROBLEM FOR MEN AS WELL AS A GUY I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S UH IT'S MAN WHO SUFFER FROM THIS TOO BECAUSE MANY TO WELL TO LEARN
UH MAINLY THE FACT THAT THEY LET WOMEN IN LAW NOW
I THINK THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE WAY PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT WOMEN
NOT JUST LAWYERS ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS AND JUDGES AND
THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN GENERAL
BECAUSE IT USED TO BE STRICTLY MAIL AND THE VIEWS ON IT USED TO BE STRICTLY MAIL
AND NOW THERE'S WOMEN IN IT AND I THINK ABOUT AFFECTING A LOT OF THINGS
OH I CAN I CAN DEFINITELY AGREE THAT I'M I'M IN A FIELD THAT MOST PEOPLE SAY IS STRICTLY MAIL
YEAH MECHANICS
OKAY I'M VERY PAINFUL AND ESPECIALLY YOU WHEN YOU HAVE CERTAIN WOMEN THAT TAKE VERY GAME VIEWS ON MOTHERS THAT ACTUALLY WORK
I'M A MOTHER TOO AND I STILL HOLD ON A JOB IN A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR KIDS ALL THE TIME YOU GET TO GO IF YOU'RE NOT BAD I DON'T THINK SO
SOME THEN BUT YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY WOMEN ARE IN THAT
YEAH
UM-HUM
OH YEAH AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST STEPS
WE HEAR ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN GENERAL COULD TAKE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S FOR SURE AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THE MEN ARE THE ONES THAT ARE FIGHTING THAT'S
BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST WOMEN GOING INTO THE WORK FORCE DOING YOU KNOW EVEN JOBS YOU KNOW ON ANYTHING KILL WITH MEN
A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE THE WOMEN THAT ARE FIGHTING IT AND MOST PEOPLE SAY WELL MEN TRYING KEEP WOMEN LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE
I MEAN THE WOMEN HAVE THESE IDEAS THAT THEY GOT TO BE THE LITTLE HOMEMAKERS AND THEY HAVE TO STAY AT HOME OR THEY'RE NOT DOING GOOD YOU KNOW A GOOD JOB
AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO BUT EVERYBODY'S LIMIT ON THE GUYS SAY WELL THE GUYS DON'T THE WOMEN NOW
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO IT'S JUST THE WOMEN HAVE TO REALIZE THEY CAN DO BOTH
YEP AND THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT WORKING AND ALSO KEEPING THE HOME TOGETHER
IN DOLLARS AND LIVES IN THE LONG TERM EFFECTS
YOU'RE READY I- IDEA IF YOU'RE READY TO START OKAY
MY NAME'S KAREN BY THE WAY WHAT WHAT'S YOUR NAME
PAYMENTS IF THAT'S
UH NICE TO MEET YOU
READY TO GO
WHAT WHAT ABOUT HOW BAD IN DIFFERENT IF IT IF I LIKE A WAR
DO YOU THINK IT WAS A WINNABLE WAR THEN
UM-HUM
YOU MEAN EAST TEXAS <UNK> OF CNN BEING TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO TO BE MORE DISTANCES AND HIS POSTURE IN GULF WAR
I'M IN OFFICE I'M SORRY UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I DO THINK ONE OF THE EFFECTS WAS THAT THE UH PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT KIND OF IN UH ACTIVITY WERE SURPRISED AT THE POWER THAT THE MEDIA HAD ON UM INTERVENING AND PROBABLY
SET THE TONE FOR MEDIA'S INVOLVED IN FUTURE WHETHER IT WAS A WAR ACTIVITY OR
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES ARE KIND OF ALL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
EVERYTHING CHANGED AFTER THAT TURNED ME
UM-HUM
WELL YOU REMEMBER THE GULF WAR THEY MADE A SPECIFIC EFFORT NOT TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES THAT THE MEDIA THEY THOUGHT THE MEDIAN AGE AND
YEAH MORE THAN WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE PEOPLE OUT IN THEIR REPORTING
UH-HUH
HUM
UH-HUH
THAT APPROACH PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SHORTENED A TIME THAT WE WERE OVER THERE TOO AT LEAST
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL UH
WELL I'M READY YEAH SURE
TERMINATOR JOHN BEEN YEAH COURT YOU LIVE
OH I LIVE IN DALLAS
THAT'S THAT'S OUT OF DALLAS
I  TO
BUT THEN THEY WERE READY TO GO
OKAY WELL IT'S UM THE WAY IT TURNED OUT IT WAS MORE THAN ANYTHING REALLY I JUST DON'T THINK I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT UH
IT JUST WASN'T CARRIED ON THE WAY IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CARRY ALL LIKE A WAR I MEAN IF WE'RE IN THERE IF I WORE REGARDLESS OF THE REASON WE WERE THERE IT SHOULD'VE BEEN FOUGHT LIKE AWARD JUST UH
HM
WELL I THINK WE DON'T WE TO BEAT THEM I DON'T THINK UH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TWENTY YEARS LATER DOWN IN DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE COUNTRY WITH THEM IN WITH US BUT UH I THINK IT WE THE HEAD ALLOW THE MILITARY PEOPLE THE CONDUCTOR LIKE A WAR
INSTEAD OF LETTING THE POLITICIANS IN THEM
AND IT PAYS DIRECTION PEOPLE LIKE THAT UH DICTATED TERMS OF THE WAY WE FOUGHT THINK THINGS WITH IT TURNED OUT A LOT DIFFERENT WAY
OH YES YEAH I MEAN IT'S JUST TOO BIG COUNTRY ALWAYS WASN'T ALWAYS WILL BE IN THE EARLY CITIZEN NOW AND THERE'S NO WAY
THAT IF WE HAD UH BEEN ABLE TO TAKE UH
USED A CAPACITY TO WE HAD A POTENTIAL WE HAD A FIGHT A WAR AGAINST THE COUNTRY LIKE THAT WE WILL VOTE WHAT WHAT A LOT ABOUT THE WAR UH LONG TERM EFFECTS SO
I UH I DON'T KNOW IT'S THAT'S A LITTLE TOUGHER TO ANSWER I THINK YOU KNOW
SPENT I GUESS UH WHO'S IN OFFICE BUT UH I THINK BUSH USED THAT UH LAST YEAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF UH BY TAKING SOME STRONGER STRONGER MEASURES <UNK> WAR STARTED
THE MORE WILL BE MORE OFFENSES ONE WANTS TO WAR STARTED
ONCE A MONTH DECIDED TO FIGHT THE THING WE'D TAKE UH TAKEN MUCH UM
MORE MONEY IN THERE AND DO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RATHER WITH THINGS RIGHT NOW I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN VIETNAM IS THAT UH THEY WE ESCALATED AND UH JUST ADD ON A GRADUAL BASIS AND GAVE THEM
OF COURSE VIETNAMESE AND THE ECON- TIME TO ADJUST TO OUR UM
INCREASES IN A PERSONNEL AND SO FORTH I JUST DIDN'T GO IN IF THEY JUST SENT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS IN THERE AT ONE TIME INITIALLY UH THINK THINGS WITH THEM DIFFERENTLY THE DIFFERENT BUT UH THEY WENT FROM
HAVE ANY ADVISOR IS UH TYPES UH THAT FOUR HUNDRED OR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME A LONG LONG NUMBER OF YEARS AND HAS IS THAT I THINK THE UH
YOU KNOW AND THEY JUST GRADUALLY ADJUSTING TO THAT AND

THE VIETNAM WAR
YEAH I'M FORTY ONE SO I WOULD
WELL I UH WAS IN COLLEGE WHEN THE WAR ESCALATED TOO IT'S HIGH AND UH
I GUESS MY FEELING AS CONSISTENT WITH OUT OF UH THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO WAS UNFORTUNATE
IS THAT UH
IT'S REAL INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT IT THE CONCEPT OF THIS NEW MOVIE JFK WHICH IS
APPARENTLY LINKING YOU KENNEDY ASSASSINATION HIS DECISION TO HIT IT TO THE APPARENTLY PEOPLE I WORK FOR CANDIDATES THEY DIDN'T DECIDE WHO'S GONNA
PLOT OF VIETNAM WAS NOT GOING TO COMMIT MORE TROOPS THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T DO ASSASSINATIONS PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAD HE HAD COME TO THAT CONCLUSION
I THINK IT WAS UH
PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF REASONS THAT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE STAY COMMUNISM WAS SELF DESTRUCTING EVEN THEN AND UH
THE HISTORY OF VIETNAM WHICH HAS BEEN UH REPRESENTED THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMENTARIES AND DOCUMENTARIES ONE ON THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM
UH IT SEEMS IT JUST DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN AND I THINK UH IT'S A VALUABLE
UH IT'S PAINFUL LESSON FOR THIS COUNTRY
RIGHT
THE TIME I WAS AND THAT UH
WASN'T THAT CHORE I- I- I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT AND WASN'T THAT POLITICALLY ACTIVE OH
BUT IT WAS
UH
APPARENTLY SOMETHING THEY COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED AND I- I YOU KNOW I THINK I LOOK AT WARS GENERALLY IS FALLING IN THAT CATEGORY UM
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT THE UH THE GULF WAR QUITE A BIT AVOIDED EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS A REMARKABLY PAINLESS WAR IS WORSE GROW
RIGHT
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES REALLY
WELL I THINK WHAT WHAT'S I- I- I- I GUESS I'D USE THE WORD RELEVANT TO THE VIETNAM WAR QUESTION IS THAT THE VIETNAM WAR WAS APPARENTLY AVOIDABLE TOO IT WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS SHE MAN
APPARENTLY CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AND SAID LOOK IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE ME WITH SUPPORT ALL I WANT TO DO IS UNIFY VIETNAM
AND UH HE WAS TURNED AWAY BY TRUMAN UM
SO IT'S
UM
A PAINFUL LESSON I GUESS ONE THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO LEARN I'M REALLY IMPRESSED BY HOW MUCH EFFECT SOMEBODY'S MOVIES A HAT ON PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS THAT JFK MOVIES CALLED CUTTING ONE PERSON AFTER ANOTHER TO
CALL FOR THEIR RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENTS IT'D BEEN SEALED

I JUST I JUST IN A BED I LIKE THE EVENING SHADE US THAT LATELY
IT REALLY IS
UH-HUH
THAT'S GREAT UM
YOU NEVER THINK ABOUT THIS GUY TWINS AND PUT THIS IN UH NEW SHOWS YOU THINK ABOUT UH
HOW THEY CAN TEACH THEM IT'S IT'S A YOUNG AGE
YEAH
OKAY WELL I DON'T HAVE AN ELDERLY PERSON THAT I COULD SEND TO A A UH NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING LIKE BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE DEAD
BUT I DID HAVE A FRIEND THAT WAS IN A CONVALESCENT HOME UH MIKE A NURSING HOME
AND I HA- WENT THERE VERY OFTEN TO VISIT HER AND UM
MAYBE STILL REALLY SAD TO SEE IF I DID HAVE A MOTHER LIVING IN I DON'T THINK I COULD DO THAT
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF BEING AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY
YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH I- I CAN BELIEVE THAT YES BECAUSE MOST ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE HAVING A LOT OF NOISE AND KIDS RUN AROUND AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S THE WAY SHE LIKE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
OH
UM-HUM
OH SEE NOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S REALLY A SAD SITUATION
YEAH REALLY YOU KNOW I JUST
UM-HUM
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH IN A CASE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU MORE OR LESS THING IT IT WOULD BE BETTER SHE WE'RE IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY GROWING UP WHERE
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM BUT IT COST OF THESE NURSING HOMES OR SO
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THAT
YOU KNOW SO YOU REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE THAT WAY IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT RICHER S- YOU KNOW UM
I KNOW THIS LADY THAT NO THAT WAS A FRIEND OF MINE KNOW HER HUSBAND WAS STILL LIVE AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS IN THERE YOU KNOW AND IT WAS COSTING HIM A SMALL FORTUNE TO KEEP HER IN THERE
SO
UM-HUM
YEAH THEN BRING HER BACK HOME AT NIGHT
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH YOU KNOW JUST COME HOME FOR DINNER AND AND USUALLY THEY WANNA GO TO BED PRETTY EARLY ANYHOW YOU KNOW SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE NICE IF WE COULD EVER GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
IF IF THEY DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THEM AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT ONE I CAN SEE MAYBE IN NURSING HOME WOULD BE BETTER YOU KNOW
BUT IF THEY THEY HAVE THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM AND EVERYTHING W-
IT'S KIND OF HARD
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
WELL UM MY MOTHER WE SAID SHE HOPE SHOULD NEVER HAD TO BE LIKE THAT AND
THE LOVE PLEASE THE ME SHE LIVED BY HERSELF AND THEN YOU KNOW ONE DAY SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND SHE WAS GONE SO SHE NEVER DID HAVE TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S
SO MANY OF US KIDS IT WAS LIKE SEVEN OF US THAT W- THAT WE WOULDN'T PROBABLY ABOUT THAT TO HAPPEN ANYHOW
YOU KNOW SHE COULD TAKEN TURNS LIVING WITH EACH ONE OF US YOU KNOW FORCED GOSH PERIOD TIME BECAUSE WE ALL DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME CITY ANYHOW OH IGNORE THE SAME STATE
SO
UH THAT I HAVE A COUPLE MORE THAT LIVES OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEN I HAVE A
QUITE A YOU GO AHEAD AND START OFF
I AGREE ALTHOUGH WE'RE IN THAT SITUATION RIGHT NOW WE HAVE UH AN EIGHTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MOTHER AND MY LITTLE THINGS RIGHT NOW
AND BECAUSE THEY WERE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU COULD NO LONGER LIVE INDEPENDENTLY
AND EVEN MOVING FROM HER HOUSE TO OUR HOUSE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY UNSETTLING FOR HER AND WE HAVE SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEY ABOUT DRIVER CRAZY
WELL WE'VE  YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLED A LOT WITH THE BECAUSE AGAIN THAT MOST OF THE NURSING HOMES I'VE BEEN IN A VERY DEPRESSING TO ME
AND SHE STILL ALERT ENOUGH THAT I THINK SHE WOULD REALLY KNOW L-  THAT WE WERE PUTTING HER THERE AND I THINK YOU'D REALLY RESENT
I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A VERY HARD BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE MY WIFE WHERE I GUESS ARE YOUNGER THAN I WAS FI-
AND HER TRYING TO STRUGGLE BECAUSE HER MOTHER REALLY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF HERSELF YOU NEED TO BE THEY CAN DRESS AND A LOT OF THOSE KIND OF THING
AND SO THE DRAIN ON THE FAMILY
AND WHEN THE KIDS HAVE KIDS COME OVER YOU KNOW SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE HERE WHY CAN'T THEY SEND THEM HOME IT'S TO KNOW EASY AND TO SAY THAT THE KIDS FRANCE
SO IT'S A HARD SITUATION YOU THE WAY I THINK
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WERE REALLY WRESTLING WITH ONE IS THE THE KIND THAT COME OUT OF OUR FAMILY TO THE POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT AS OPPOSED TO CONSIDERING HER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND
OH OH PROHIBITIVE
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOME ALTERNATIVES LIKE A DOLL DAY CARE
THAT'S MORE READILY AVAILABLE IN I THINK IF WE COULD CENTER SOMEPLACE FOR THE DAY
AND SHE COULD BE AROUND SOME ELDERLY PEOPLE AND HAVE SOME ACTIVITIES WOULD BE MORE INTEREST HER AND THEN IN THE EVENING EVER RETURN AND BE WITH THE FAMILY
YEAH
BUT THERE'S NOT MANY OF THOSE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE VERY HARD TO GET ME INTO AND
WE TRIED TO ANY OF THOSE SENIOR CITIZEN CENTER BUT THEY'RE REALLY NOT PREPARED TO COPE WITH THEIR BAKSHEESH SOMEWHAT SENILE AND A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE ENG- AT SHE CAMPER TO DISSIPATE IN
WELL I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A GRAIN OF AMERICA WERE READING AND A HALF TO AS A AS A COUNTRY FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN YOU DO WITH IT
BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION AND YOU KNOW YOU HA- THING THAN JUST SORT OF SAND OFTEN NOT WELL CARED FOR
AND YET
AND I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE PHYSICAL ABILITY TOO YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD BE AND DOING SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN WHEN THEY'RE JUST SORT OF NEEDING ALMOST CONSTANT SUPERVISION IN CARE
YEAH
YOU ALL CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
OKAY A UTAH HAVE UH A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM OR UH
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I CAN'T REALLY
DO THE DIFFICULTY UH OR ANY PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE OTHER THAN
THEY KEEP SAYING A CPA SCORES WERE LITTLE
OR LOWER THAN WELL WE'RE I'M ABOUT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ABOUT
THEY'RE TALKING IN THE NEWSPAPER AT ALL TIME AND WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES AND FIND SOME OUT
WHICH I THINK THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO TO INCREASE THAT SO
I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S TOO MANY SERIOUS THE PROBLEM WITH OUR
THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN UTAH
UM WHAT ABOUT TEXAS
UH-HUH
YEAH
EIGHT
HUH
WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE KIND OF CONTROLLING THE THE SCHOOLS IN SOME AREAS
OH BOY

OH WELL I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET I HOPE IT DOESN'T BUT THE
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE A FEW GANGS HERE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOLS

THEY HAVE UH SECURITY GUARDS YOU TROLL IT ALWAYS AND
AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD LEARNING SITUATION IF YOU'VE GOT A A POLICEMAN THERE TOO
KEEP KIDS IN CLASS AND
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IT'S KIND OF GETTING TO THAT POINT IN TEXAS AND AT LEAST WHERE YOU'RE RIGHT
YES
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE AND I THINK THAT UH
YEAH YOU KNOW YOU TAUGHT SCHOOL SYSTEMS WE
WE'VE GOT OUR BEEPERS GOING FROM THE SOCIAL CLASSES BACK TO
A LOT OF THE ACADEMIC CLASSES THAT UH THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY
I THINK THAT IS THAT'S A GOOD CHANGE TOO
TO GET BACK TO THE MONEY UH
OFF THE WALL CLASSES THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH AN ACADEMIC I-
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST
IT UH
YES THERE DOES I CAN'T UH
GO FROM ONE EXTREME THE OTHER AND
TH- THERE HAS TO BE ABOUT THE GUY THE PEOPLE THERE BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER ON THE ACADEMIC PORTION
IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR THE SOCIETY DAY WITH THE TECHNOLOGY'S AND IT'S
THEY'VE GOT A HAVE A GOOD MATH AND ENGLISH BACK IN ORDER TO COMPETE
NO THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT UH IN SOME OF THE STATES BY GOING TO TWO HUNDRED DAYS A YEAR IS IT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR SCHOOL YEAR IS THERE

OH I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER HAVE ANOTHER ONE AFTER THE PHONE BUT SO FAR HAS TWO MEAN TO ME
UM DO YOU TEST DRIVE A LOT OF CARS BEFORE YOU UM BOTTOM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
I AGREE WITH THAT
UM-HUM
YES I HAVE THE SAME THING HERE
YEAH I KIND OF GOES RIGHT ALONG WITH WHAT I'M THINKING TOO IS WELL OF OF MOVIES IN THE TV THE VIOLENCE AND ALL THE
THINGS THAT ARE ON THEIR IF THE PARENTS WERE HOME IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME HOME THEY THEY WOULDN'T BE WATCHING AS MUCH AS AS
BUT THEN AGAIN THERE'S SOME I'M AT HOME AT NIGHT WITH THEM THAT DO NOT MONITOR WHAT THEIR CHILDREN OR WATCHING
AND SO I- I- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT IT IS PARENTS CARE AND UH NOT TOO MAYBE PUT ALL HAVING THAT OTHER CAR THE OTHER TV OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE WORKING OR
AND TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN
UM-HUM WOULD YOU FIND OUT
YEAH I CAN BELIEVE THAT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT THAT AND MAYBE NOT QUITE SO MUCH PUBLICITY EITHER I THINK THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH PUBLISHED A ON SOME OF THESE BY MY CLIENTS THAT TIME AND AND IT SEEMS TO BECOME A CHALLENGE
TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT
RIGHT THAT THAT IT'S
UM-HUM WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND ALWAYS GOOD THING THAT CHILDREN OTHER ONES AND SUPPER
YES I AM AND
RIGHT YES THAT'S I'M TELL THE FAMILIES CHECK I THINK YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT WILL WORK FROM
YES UH-HUH UH BACK TO THE OLD BASIC MORALS AND
AND AND THAT'S IT
I- I DON'T KNOW WHY I STOPPED AT IT  BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME OFF FOR THAT AND
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL I FEEL LIKE THE MAJOR PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE REASON THAT CRIME IS GONE SO OUT OF HAND IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A PUNISHMENT THAT'S MATCHING WHAT'S BEING DONE
AND I THINK IT STARTS WHEN THE KIDS ARE WELL I THINK THE PARENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING THAT'S ALL RIGHT
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A LOT OF PARENTS ESPECIALLY WHERE I NOW I HAVE A LOT OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY OF WHATEVER IS DONE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER M- UH HOME
AND I SEE A LOT OF CARE A VERY SMALL KIDS COMING HOME TO AND BE HOME EVERY DAY AND DOING ALL KINDS OF UNBELIEVABLE THINGS AND AS LONG AS THEY DON'T LET ANYBODY KNOW ABOUT IT THEY GET AWAY WITH IT SO
YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE A PARK MOTHER STAYED HOME IF WE HAD THAT SECURE START YOU KNOW WHERE KIDS LEARN THE RIGHT WAY TO ACT AND THEY WERE REWARDED FOR THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR
AND THEY HAD A SECURE FAMILY IT THEY CAME FROM I THINK WOULD SEE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SOCIETY
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
WELL YOU KNOW I DID A SURVEY ON W- M- LET THEIR CHILDREN TO GO TO WORK AND I FOUND OUT THAT MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE I TAUGHT TOO
THE M- WENT TO WORK TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND WHEN I TALKED WITH THEIR CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN WANTED THEIR PARENTS HOME RATHER THAN THE THE MATERIAL THINGS THEY WERE GETTING
AND IT'S JUST TOO BAD THAT THE PARENTS WON'T LISTEN TO THIS SURVEY
WELL I JUST THINK THAT UM ANOTHER PROBLEM IS I THINK THE WAY THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET UP THAT THE CRIMINALS TO GET OUT IN THE JAILS ARE SO OVERCROWDED THEY CAN'T HANDLE PUNISHING THIS THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING THAT BAD CRIMES
SUFFICIENTLY I THINK THEY NEED TO PUT MORE PEOPLE OUT TO DEATH UM IF IT'S COMPLETELY WITNESSED THAN THAT UH SEEN IT THERE'S NO
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT BUT IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR
RIGHT I THINK
SO HOW DO YOU WHAT
YEAH OR OUT- DO WHAT'S BEEN DONE FOR
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM UM I KNOW THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS READING A BOOK WHEN I WAS STUDYING HISTORY
THEY SAID YOU SHOW ME I COUNTRY THAT CAN PRETTY STRONG FAMILIES IN YOU KNOW HAVE A STRONG COUNTRY
AND IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER UNITED STATES HISTORIES OUR COUNTRY WITH STRONG AND TELL THE M- START LEAVING THE HOME
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEY DO AND THEN THEY GROW UP AND IT JUST CONTINUALLY WILL GET WORSE
SO
I GUESS WHAT WE BOTH AGREE ON IS THE FAMILIES NEEDED CHANGE THEIR WAY THEY SHE
RIGHT AND I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF UH AN IDEA OF W- W- HERE IN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN WHAT WERE WORKING TOWARDS AND WHITES IMPORTANT TO DO THESE THINGS RATHER THAN JUST GETTING AHEAD MATERIALISTICALLY
THAT'S RIGHT  WELL UM DO THEY KIND OF DO THEY COME IN AND SAY WE TALKED TO THAT FOR FIVE MINUTES
RIGHT
UM
WE JUST GOT I JUST GOT DOWN HERE THAT WITH SOMEONE THAT UM LAST WEEK ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW IT COULD BE IMPROVED ON JURIES AND WE DISCUSSED ABOUT HOW HALF THE JURY THAT THEY SELECT TOO
YOU KNOW COME UP WITH THE VERDICT IF HALF OF THOSE WERE LAW STUDENT THEN THEY COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE COURT ROOM
AND HAVE THE TIME THAT THEY SPEND IN THEIR JURY DISTRICT COUNT TOWARD SOME OF THEIR GRADUATION HOURS
WOULDN'T THAT BE A GOOD IDEA I THINK SO SOMETIMES THE JURIES DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE THE LEGAL YOU KNOW TALK AND AND WHAT'S GOING ON
AND THIS WAY WOULD GET PEOPLE THAT WERE A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE AT LEAST HALF OF THEM
WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN THAT DOESN'T GO TO COLLEGE WENT TO COLLEGE SHARP GOT TO GO OR ANYTHING
OH DID YOU BECOME
OH
OH OH MY GOODNESS
UH I HAVE A SON AT THE PRESENT BUILDING TOO IT'S A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND UH THAT SHE HAD UH MADE THREE APPLICATIONS TO SCHOOLS THEY GET THE COUPLE DEGREE PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED TO UH TAKE
SO SHE APPLIED TO GIVE IT TO TEXAS AT AUSTIN AND TO PVC PENNSYLVANIA AND TWO LIFE
SO UH IT HE'S WAITING AT THIS TIME BUT UH TOO IT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF UH ACCEPTED IS ANYBODY GRAMS LIKE THAT COME IN FOR HIM

THEY YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO PHILMONT ARE THEY
SO
RIGHT TODAY THAT GOING AGAIN
OKAY WELL UH I'M GOING WITH THEM
NO
REALLY
A ON THIS RECYCLING ITSELF I DON'T KNOW WHAT Y'ALL ARE DOING BUT WE'RE NOT DOING A WHOLE LOT HERE IN ARLINGTON ABOUT IT SO OFTEN THEY HAVE A TRIAL SECTION THAT UH
PART OF THE CITY HAS BEEN GIVEN THESE UM IT'S PLASTIC GARBAGE CANS WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SEPARATE AND PUT IT ALTO
I DON'T HAPPEN TO BE IN THE PLASTIC CITY THAT DOES BATHTUB HOPES
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YES
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THE GROCERY STORES HERE HAVE USED THE US AND DAN FLABBY PLASTIC BAG RECYCLING AND SOME OF THE PLASTIC JUGS AND BOTTLES TYPE THING
UH-HUH
WE DON'T HAVE VERY OUT I DO NOT KNOW OF A VERY GOOD PLACE FOR GLASS HERE
THAT I DON'T I WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO TAKE GLASS AND
OH YES THEY'LL RECYCLE CLOSE WE HAVE PLACES THAT THOSE AND OFF ALL WHILE THEY WERE THE NEWSPAPERS THERE WERE A PLACE THAT'S I THINK THEY HAVE SO MANY NEWSPAPERS NOW THEY'RE KIND OF DISCOURAGING US FROM TAKING THEM ANY PLACE
UM-HUM
YES I KNOW AND WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM  BUT UH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
HUM
YES
WELL THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
OH
BUT DO YOU ALL HAVE ANYPLACE AROUND THERE FOR UM USED ALL CAR ALL
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH
RIGHT UH-HUH UH-HUH
MY GOODNESS
BUT
RIGHT
RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA THE
CITY FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS HAS CERTAIN THINGS HAD A TRIAL SECTION THAT WAS HAVING CURBSIDE RECYCLING WITH SPECIAL CONTAINERS
AND THEN THEY JUST DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND THEY SIT IN PIECE BY PIECE OF EVERY YEAR A DIFFERENT PIECE OF THE CITY GETS ADDED TO THE LIST
BUT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD THEY'VE HAD VOLUNTARY RECYCLING FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW
YOU ON THE FIRST IN THIRD SATURDAYS OF EVERY MONTH YOU TAKE YOUR
BOTTLES AND YOUR NEWSPAPERS AND LET'S SEE BOTTLES NEWSPAPERS TO CERTAIN CORNERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND THERE'S A FARMER'S MARKET THAT COLLECTS THE PLASTIC THEY UM
IT USED TO BE A FIRE HOUSE
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SOME URBAN RENEWAL GOING AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT AREA SAFER I LIVE NEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WHERE I'M A GRAD STUDENT
AND IT'S NOT THE SAFEST NEIGHBORHOOD AREA
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET HER BURNER NEW LITTLE GOING AND THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS FARMERS MARKET UH SINCE COLLECT PLASTIC
AND THEY JUST USE THAT MONEY TO KEEP UP THE BUILDING AND WORK AND I SAID IT'S THAT KIND OF THING
RIGHT THEY HAVE THAT FOR THE PLASTIC BAGS HERE TOO YEAH BUT SEE AND THE
UM
UH-HUH HOW ABOUT ALUMINUM CANS SO THEY RECYCLE THAT
RIGHT WELL THE ONLY PROBLEM THING IS THAT IT PROBABLY DIDN'T PROFITABLE SURE JUST FROM A STANDPOINT OF MAKING YOU PAPER TO RECYCLE
BUT WORRY YOU END UP HAVING TO SAVINGS IS THAT YOUR LANDFILLS LAST SO MUCH LONGER
AT HOME I KNOW MY FOLKS
UM
LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THEY'VE HAD SOME LANDFILL FILLING UP PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTY BUILT YOU LANDFILL AND UH SO I WASN'T GEOLOGICALLY PROPER
SO UH BUT THE LANDFILL CONSIDERATION IS A GOOD REASON THAT PROBABLY COMMUNITIES ARE STILL GOING TO END UP PAYING TO HAVE THE PAPER TAKEN AWAY BUT THEY'LL JUST WON'T HAVE TO BUILD LANDFILLS OFTEN
ANOTHER THING TO DO AND NOT AT HOME BUT IN THE OFFICES HERE IS RECYCLING OF PAPER AND
THAT'S DONE BY SEPARATING THOUGH WHITE PAPER WHICH IS I GUESS IS A HIGHER QUALITY
FROM THE MISCELLANEOUS PAPER
AND WE'LL ELSE'S RECYCLING CANS
HAVE EVERY OFFICE HAS TWO LITTLE CARDBOARD BOXES FOR PUTTING IN THE WHITE PAPER AND THE NEXT PAPER
A BIG TRASH CANS DOWN AT THE END OF A HALT WAYS IT WHEN THEY GET FILLED UP YOU CAN GO TAKE THEM DOWN THE HALL
OH YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE THING THAT KIND OF BOTHERED ME UP NOW WHATEVER I USUALLY GET MY W- MY OIL CHANGE MY GOOD IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA THERE'S BEEN A GOOD YEAR TAR STORY BUT IT'S BEEN SERVICE IN MY CAR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
AND THEY HAVE PRETTY ECONOMICAL RATES BUT NOW IN SOUTH CAROLINA THERE'S THIS
MANDATORY RACE RECYCLING FEE AND MY DADDY WOULD LIKE TO GET THE USUAL THE PULLOVER FENCE CLOSE
SO YOU KNOW TO MAKE THE FENCE POST LAST LONGER AND WHETHER BETTER BUT THEY WON'T PICK HIM GOODYEAR STORE WON'T EVEN
THEY SAY THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING WELL THEY SAY IT'S AGAINST THE FEDERAL LAW NOW
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO CHARGE PE WASTE RECYCLING SEE
SO THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET ITSELF DRAWING WHEN THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF FEDERAL ALL THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR VIEWS PULL BACK IS TO DO IT YOURSELF
UM-HUM
WELL HERE IN SASKATOON UM MUCH THE SAME THING THERE IS NO CURBSIDE PICKUP OFF UH
ANY OF THE RECYCLED PRODUCTS UH WHERE THE COMMUNITY OF ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE UH THERE ARE YOU AREAS WHERE WE COULD UH ACTUALLY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THE UH
HANDICAPPED SOCIETY'S TYPE OF PLACES WHERE THEY UH
ONE THEY DO IS JUST AS A RECYCLING OPERATION AND THEN OTHERS THEY UH COLLECT THE PAPER JUST THE TWO OTHER RETAILER SO UH WE'RE ABLE TO UH
HAVE DROP OFF BINS FOR NEWSPAPERS AND CARDBOARD AND THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN THERE ARE
THERE'S THE UH DEPOSIT PROGRAM ON PLASTIC AND GLASS CONTAINERS WELL PRIMARILY SOFT DRINKS BOTTLES AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO UH TAKE IT TWO ONE OF THE UH
REHABILITATION CENTERS AND AND THEY RECYCLE THE CONTAINERS ARE THEY REFUND THE DEPOSIT WHICH IS ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO FIFTEEN CENTS A CONTAINER AND THEN
RIGHT YEAH ON THE LAWN PRIMARILY ON SOFT DRINK POP THAT KIND OF THING
AND UH SOLD IN THE IN JUICE RECYCLING OF PLASTIC AND GLASS SOFT GREEN CONTAINERS UH WE DO HAVE
ONE OF THE SCRAP METAL DEALERS THAT WILL ACCEPT CANNON ALUMINUM CANS AS WELL
UH IT'S FAIRLY FAIRLY EXPENSIVE BUT AGAIN IT'S UM IT'S UH INITIATIVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON BECAUSE THERE IS NO CORRUGATED PICK UP BY THE CITY
WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S
THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOWLS
GENERALLY THE UH
THE HANDICAP GROUP TAKES CARE OF THESE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS PLACED A DEPOSIT WHICH IS THE INDUCEMENT TO REACH RECYCLE THE BOTTLE SO THAT YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK
AND THEN THE RECYCLER RUN BY THE HANDICAP SOCIETY PAYS BACK THE COST OF THE DEPOSIT
AND THEN I'VE BEEN THEN THEN TURN WILL GET UH SOME MONEY FROM THE BOSS PERSON FROM THE THE PEOPLE THAT DO THE CANNING AT THE POP AND THE BEER AS WELL
WELL UM I GUESS PARTLY BECAUSE OF OUR CLIMB UP HERE IN SASKATOON AT LEAST IN THE MAJORITY OF
CENTRAL UH WELL I WANT TO SAY CENTRAL CANADA THAT CENTER CANADA TEST TO BE REFERRED MORE TOO ONTARIO AND GO BACK
BUT UH
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A SITUATION WHERE WE MIGHT CALL THEM HOMELESS PEOPLE WE CERTAINLY HAVE A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ON WELFOR WELFARE AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT KIND OF THING UM
THERE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE GATE
IN PLAYING PEOPLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING WELL BILL UM
IT'S COATS AND
HOCKEY TEAMS AND BALL TEAMS THOSE KINDS OF IT REGULARLY DO BOTTLE DRIVES WHERE THEY GO AROUND VERY STABLE RELIGION COLLECTING THE BOTTLES THAT INDIVIDUAL HOMES
THEY HAVE DONE IT'S UM
UM BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY QUITE EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF COLLECTING THAT'S NEWSPAPERS THEY'RE ACTUALLY IT
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SHOPPING CENTERS LIKE THE SHOPPING MALLS THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTAINERS WHERE THE GROUP CALLED COSMOPOLITAN INDUSTRIES
COLLECTS OR PEOPLE CAN DROP TURN USED NEWSPAPERS IN OTHER PAPERS IN THE BINS AND THEN THE BINS OR COLLECTED
A STEVE UM WE JUST UH THEY THEY STARTED A RECYCLING PROGRAM HERE I THINK THAT I SHOULD IS MY FIRST EXTERNSHIPS LIGHTNING PROGRAMS BUT UM INCENTIVE JUST LIKE TOSSING EVERYTHING AWAY WHICH I WAS SO BAD ABOUT
UM I'M STARTING A SPLIT STUFF SPLIT STUFF OFF THE ONLY DISADVANTAGES THAT THEY DON'T PICK IT UP AT THE CURB THEY MAKE ME DRIVE IT LIKE A MILE DOWN THE ROAD AND SPLIT UP DOWN THERE WHEN THEY DO UP THERE
BUT THE DEPOSITS ONLY ON LIKE DRINK STUFF
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO IS THEY HAVE YOUR GIFTS AND YOU'RE YOU GETTING THESE PRODUCTS TO THE HANDICAP GROUP ANY HANDICRAFT TYPE GROUP IS GETTING THE UH THE MONEY
OR OR YOU GO OR THEY SOMEHOW DISTRIBUTING FUNDS BACK TO YOU
OKAY
I THINK WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S A A I HEARD ABOUT IT THE SUMMER PROGRAM YOUR CITY WHERE UH THEY COLLECT HOMELESS INCORPORATED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WHAT THEY DO THE EMPLOYEE UM HOMELESS I THINK MOST MEN BUT HOMELESS PEOPLE
TO UH GO OUT AND COLLECT ALL OF THE RECYCLABLE CANS AND AND I THINK IT'S MOSTLY CANCER MAYBE BALLS IS WELL LIKE BEER CANS SODA CANS WHAT NOT ANY UH BRING THEM UP SO ONE
WELL ONE CENTRALIZED LOCATION AND UH OUR LOOK LIKE THE MONEY FROM VARIOUS BEER AND AND SO THE MANUFACTURERS AND UH AND AND GET MORE MONEY TO THESE PEOPLE THAT DESPERATELY NEEDED
OKAY YEAH
DO THEY DO WITH NEWSPAPERS AS WELL
HUM
-KAY SUPPOSEDLY WE'RE RECORDING NOW
OF HAVING TO THINK THIS MARY THIRTY MINUTES AGO WAS READING THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR BE DOING IT AT AT THE GET WHAT MY LUMBER IT WAS ONE OF THE FEATURES THAT WORKED OUT IT WAS A FREON FREE AIR-CONDITIONED SYSTEM
IS THE FIRST I'VE SEEN OF IT TOO UM I KIND OF KIND OF I'M S- KIND OF SURPRISED THAT THAT
I'D BE COMING BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THESE THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BE CLOSED SYSTEM I MEAN ONE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE LEAGUE SORT THE FAILURES I WOULD THINK THAT UH
IT WAS DESIGNED WITH REGAL PRUNES STUFF WOULDN'T GET LOOSE AND UH YOU DON'T WANT TO IT'S NOT CHEAP AND GETTING FELT WHAT DOES
SO UH KIND OF SURPRISED BECAME THAT MUCH OF THE SHOWS THAT HAS
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
SO WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE OTHER BIG YOU BEING IN THE REAL THE WEALTH SOMETHING THAT THAT IS
YEAH YEAH I UM TRADE CARS RECENTLY AND WENT FROM A CAR THAT GOT SEVENTEEN MILES PER GALLON
OF WITH O- ON PREMIUM AND DIDN'T REALLY WASN'T HAPPY WITH PREMIUM WAS HIGH ENOUGH
TO A CAR THAT GETS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILES PER GALLON UH THE THE CHEAPEST GARBAGE EQUIPMENT
SO I P- SHOULD BY SURE THERE AND UH TRYING TO THINK WAS SOME THERE IS SOME TALK ABOUT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BE AND
HE MADE YOUR FACTOR OF AND ENGINE THAT REQUIRED LEADED FUEL AT SOME POINT THAT UH
THIS I BELIEVE IS READ IS PUT THE GENERALLY THE ASIAN UH WORLD GOING NUTS BECAUSE
A A DELIBERATION ENGINE CLOSE THEY WOULD'VE THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO OVERHAUL AND IF IT FLIES A HUNDRED HOURS A YEAR
THAT'S MARVELOUS HIGH SO THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS SPENT PER UNIT OF POLLUTION SAVED
UH VER- VERY TINIEST COMPARED TO A CAR WHERE IT'S A RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE EDGES RUNNING FOR A LOT LONGER PER YEAR
UH SO IT'S A QUESTION OF UM THE APPARENTLY UH THE EPA THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AGAIN DECIDE THAT
BEAT THAT THAT'S REALLY VISITED SMOKE COUNT
THEY ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO BURN THE FUELS BUT THERE'S SOME CONCERN OVER A FACILITY MARKET IS ANYBODY THAT I WANNA BOTHER MAKING THE FIELD
IT'S AN OLD JOKE ABOUT THE UH FIVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY COULD BUY
BUT THE ISSUE BUT UH
YEAH I'VE ALWAYS CUTE IT AS UH THE POLLUTION ISSUE OF THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS ISSUE IF UM SOME OF THE DUMP THEIR GARBAGE IF UH ONE
UH REGULARLY
YOU KNOW LEGAL RECOURSE BUTTER FEED THEM TO THE AIR START BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY
THAT UH I THINK THEY'RE IN LIKE A BIG PART OF A PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S VIEWED LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE IT WAS IT
THAT'S INTERESTING I HADN'T SEEN THAT OH I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT FREON CONTRIBUTING TO BE
THE UH WHOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER ANOTHER VARIOUS POLLUTION BUT UH OTHER THAN
UH MAKING THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS TIGHTER I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANY WORK ON UH ALTERNATE COOLANTS
UM-HUM
THE UH THE THE TIMES THAT I'VE SEEN ANY SORT OF OF LOSS IS UH
AT A TIME WHEN MAYBE I'D HAVE A CAUSE THE THE UH FREON CHECK IN THE AIR CONDITIONER MAYBE TOP OFF
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY'D PRACTICALLY WASTE ALMOST AS MUCH AS UH THEY'D PUT IN THE CAR BUT I'VE NOTICED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT UH THE CONTROLS LOVED THAT CAR
TIGHTER UH PEOPLE ARE A LOT MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
WELL OBVIOUSLY CARS UH THAN TRUCKS CONTRIBUTE QUITE A BIT
AND PERSONALLY ARE A LOT RIGHT CARPOOL UH MOST OF THE TIME WITH SOMEONE AT WORK WITH BUT MY SCHEDULE THOSE BUT UH
DOESN'T MAKE FOR A CONSISTENT CARPOOL
UM-HUM
THAT'S UH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION UH THE WEDDING FUEL SEV- OBVIOUSLY BEEN OUT OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THERE'S ALWAYS TALK ABOUT UH
ABOUT REGULATING THE EMISSIONS THAT UH A CAR ENGINE CAN PRODUCED AND TIGHTENING DOWN ON THAT AND OF COURSE THE UH
YE- LARGE AUTOMAKERS IN THIS COUNTRY SPEND ON TOLD MILLIONS TO LOBBY TO KEEP BUSINESS JUST THE SAME AS USUAL
THERE'S A A BIG ISSUE IN RHODE ISLAND RIGHT NOW ON THERE IS A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUILD A COLD FIRED HOT ENERGY PLANT VERY CLOSE TO TO DOWNTOWN PROVIDENCE
AND THEY ARE PULLING ALL SORTS OF TRICKS TO MANEUVER AROUND VARIOUS CONTROLS ON INSPECTIONS AND REGULATIONS APPARENTLY EASY
THE- REGULA-
OKAY SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
YES
SO THEY CURRENTLY PRACTICING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT YOUR STATE
YES THAT'S SIMILAR TO GEORGIA
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE CONSIDERING
YES YES UM I GUESS IN A WAY THAT IT IT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE HAVING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS
YES
RIGHT THAT WOULD BE INTENT OF IT
WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IF IT WAS A APPLIED
YOU KNOW MORE EXPEDIENT MANNER AFTERWARDS SO MANY APPEALS YEAH IF IF THE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO COMMIT THE CRIME KNEW THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE PUNISHED A REALLY POSSIBLY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
UH I'LL RESEARCH ENGINEER WORK ENOUGH WITH GEORGIA TECH
MAN
YES
HUM
UM-HUM
HUM THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE BUT I GUESS
THERE'S OTHER FACTORS THAT ABOUT ABOUT THE PUMPING ONE IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS A GOOD THING BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
OH I SEE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
SO IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE WHAT WH-
HUM
YEAH I GUESS IT'S NOT AN EASY SOLUTION THERE'S THERE'S NO WE SOLUTION FOR THAT
UM-HUM
I'M SURE IT IS YEAH
HM YEAH I DON'T I DON'T CERTAINLY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS IN THE SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT
UH
I GUESS I AM FOR CERTAIN CRIMES YEAH IN CERTAIN CRIMES
UM PREMEDITATED MURDER
CRIMES OF THAT NATURE I THINK SHOULD DEFINITELY ANY MASS MURDER TYPE INDIVIDUAL
HUM
UM-HUM
WELL YOU ALWAYS HAVE CASTRATION
YES I READ ABOUT THAT
UM-HUM
I HAVE AND THEY LET FEELINGS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR IF IT'S THE KIND AT TI WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT IS
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IT'S VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN YOU KNOW TEXAS IS WHEN THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE COUNTRY
AND HE HAS A LI- BUDGET WISE
AND UH
YES WE DO PRACTICE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT THE NATURE OF THE UH COURTS AND THE APPEALS AND STAYS AND ALL THAT MEANS THAT IT'S A VERY LONG HAUL BEFORE ANYBODY'S EVER EXECUTED
TO WORK AND AND THEN I WAS READING IN THE PAPER JUST THIS MORNING FISHING BECAUSE I'VE HAD FORGOTTEN I GUESS I LOVE TO SEW TOPIC BEING THAT IT COSTS MORE TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY THAT THAT IT DOES TO KEEP THEM
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE BECAUSE OF ALL THE COST OF THE APPEALS AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW
WELL I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SUPPOSED TO BE
PRIMARILY A DETERRENT TO OTHER PEOPLE
YOU KNOW WHO WOULD SEE IT
YEAH BUT I'M NOT SURE
HOW SUCCESSFUL BUT A LOT
WHAT'S <UNK> MAYBE YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL WHAT KIND OF WHERE DO YOU DO
UM-HUM WELL SEE I'M A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
AND IN A VERY POOR SECTION OF TIME WITH PRE- PREDOMINANTLY ANGLO P- IT
AND I SEE KIDS ARE AT THAT ARE GONNA BE CRIMINAL
INSTEAD OF EVERYTHING WE CAN DO IT
AND SEE I'M AFRAID I THINK IF WE WOULD TAKE THE EQUIPMENT AMOUNT OF MONEY INVESTED IN YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT I MEAN BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU GOT TO DO SOME OF THE ONES THAT ARE THEY THEY UH
BUT I THINK IF WE WOULD MAKE A BIGGER INVESTMENT IN KIDS
WE'D HAVE FEWER DECISIONS TONIGHT
DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW
OH YEAH OH
WELL I'M NOT TELL THAT JUST IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
YEAH I KNOW THAT LIKE AND HE AND UH
I'M AFRAID I THINK THAT THEIR KIDS WHO JUST ARE THEY TAKE IT HOME
AND
REALLY
I I NOTICED HE SEEMS TO WORK THAT WELL BUT IT'S A BAD DAY BECAUSE  IN ALL THESE KIDS THROUGH MY OFFICE IN A SCHOOL OF FIVE HUNDRED VERY SEVENTY EIGHT
AND THAT KIND OF MY GOOD SOLID T- AND I HAVE THE SAME THIRTY SEVEN HOUSES EVERYDAY
AND A LOT OF THEIR PARENTS ARE TOTALLY YEARS NOW
SOME OF THEM IN THE PENAL SYSTEM
AND YOU KNOW YOU SEE THOSE KIDS GOING DOWN THE ROAD NOW NOT ALL OF THEM WILL BECOME IT IF IT'S IT'S IT HAS TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT SOME OF I'VE ALREADY BEEN USED TO
AND THAT KIND OF THING IF WE HAD SOMETHING TO DO BEFORE THEY GET TO BE FULL BLOWN ADULT CRIME
AND I'M NOT A BAD EXPERIENCE GO SIT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE AGES OF ALL THE SOCIAL ACTION
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE REASON WE GOT PRIVATE SCHOOLS
UH IN SOME OF MY ALL PROB- BUT A LOT OF IT'S BECAUSE EVERYTHING SOCIETY WANTS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BUT THAT'S NOT A THREAT BUT
WELL ANYWAY I DEALT WITH TWO OR THREE KIDS TODAY THAT EVEN IN THAT
WITH SOMEBODY HAD MAKE A DECISION WITH THE WITH
UM-HUM I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION BUT
IF YOU COULD FIND A WAY TO PREVENT SOME OUT AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD BE
IT WOULD BE MONEY BETTER SPENT
AND YOU KNOW I CA- SMALLER THE KEEPING AN EYE ON DEATH ROW BUT IT DOES SEEM TO GET BEHIND IT
THAT'S TRUE
STATISTICALLY THAT'S TOO
WELL
ARE YOU FOLLOW
I'M SORRY YOU LIVE IN SOME CASES AND SO ON
WHAT KIND OF CRIMES WOULD YOU DO YOU DO THE PHONE OH
UM-HUM
I- I WOULD CONSIDER IT FOR SEXUAL ABUSE THAT TOO
ON THAT ONE
YOU KNOW AND I WANTED TO THE POTATO WITH THESE WITH CHILDREN
WELL YOU KNOW SOMEBODY ELECTED THAT RECENTLY
AND ALL THAT SO A LOT OF PEOPLE UP ON THAT YOU KNOW
BUT UH
WELL I'VE RECENTLY DROPPED MY SUBSCRIPTION TO THE LOCAL PAPER WELL NOT EXACTLY LOCAL IT'S A PRETTY BIG ONE ELEVEN JOURNAL CONSTITUTION JESUS THOROUGHLY IN TOTALLY DISGUSTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PAPER
IT'S REALLY PRETTY POOR AND I COULDN'T SEE SPENDING HALF AN HOUR DAY LOOKING THROUGH THAT
THAT TRY TO WATCH THE NEWS IS WELL WE DID UH CABLE HERE IN WANTS HEADLINE NEWS BUT IT'S SUCH A UH
OH THAT IS REALLY VERY LITTLE DEATHS DO IT THEY SEEM TO BE REALLY OUT TRYING ENTERTAIN MORE THAN UH
YOU KNOW PASS ON ANY REAL INFORMATION SPREE TRASHING NOT HAPPY WITH IT
BUT
BUT I THINK MORE THE UM THE JUST THE THE REAL LACK OF MEAT BEHIND IT I THINK THERE'S AN ARTICLE IN SOME LOCAL NEWS MAGAZINE RECENTLY THAT MENTIONED IT WOULD TALK ABOUT THE UH LEVEL OF
UH READING ABILITY YOU'LL OR SOMETHING OR OTHER AND THINGS LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH IS UH STATEMENTS THE PUBLIC AND THEY WERE COMPARING THEM WITH MICHAEL DUKAKIS BACK DURING THE OLD UH
THE THE LAST COLLECTION NONSENSE AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW DUKAKIS IS STATEMENTS WORD LIKE UH TEST THE TWELFTH GRADE READING LEVEL WALL BUSHES WERE DOWN AROUND IN EIGHTH GRADE LEVEL IN BY THAT
UM BEING ABLE TO INVADED AT LARGE MUCH LARGER AN AUDIENCE YOU KNOW HE
DISPOSAL THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATOR AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE NEWS IS THEY'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH BABIES SO MANY PEOPLE IT'S JUST COMING OUT REALLY PRETTY POOR
UM-HUM
YEAH I AGREE
UM-HUM
YEAH THAT'S LIKE UH TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE IN YOUR HOUSE BY RUNNING THE HERE IN THE AIR CONDITIONER AT THE SAME TIME
AND UH

I'M SURPRISED AT THE THE THE RANGING QUALITY OF THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE LIKE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN THAT'S SUCH A BROAD UM SPECTRUM OF SCIENCE AND YET IT'S REALLY IN DEPTH THE SAME TIME
YEAH AND THAT WILL
WELL THE SAME COMPANY
YEAH I AGREE WE RECENTLY HAD NEWSWEEK AT THE HOUSE ONE AND DROPPED IT DECIDED REALLY WAS WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN WE STARTED SUBSCRIPTION TO US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT BUT IT HASN'T STARTED ARRIVING YET

A- ARE YOU ON HAPPY WITH THE UH WITH UH HOUSES THAT UH
W- THE ONE-SIDEDNESS OTHER <UNK>
WELL I'M MY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T UH

UH SCIENCE AND HE SIGNED UP FOR
UH
THEY SURE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT

THEY DID NOT SHOW AFFECTION IT TO THE CHILDREN AND THAT THEY DID NOT SHOW THEM CARE CITY SMALL CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING LAUGHED
UM THEY
ONE TIME I PICKED UP THIS LITTLE BOY WHO WAS CRYING AND THE OWNER CAME IN JUST SHOOT ME UP ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE EVERY TIME AND YOU WANT YOU BECOME UH

BUT
YEAH YOU KNOW I'M CONVINCED THAT WELL IT'S KIND OF IS THERE'S ONE DRIVING RIGHT NOW IS A FORD PROBE WHICH IS MANUFACTURED IN A MAZDA FACTORY IN ILLINOIS

WITH SO THAT APPLES AS THEY AREN'T APPLE APPLE JUICE IN TURKEY
VERY PROBABLY YOU KNOW SO YEAH I THINK THE IDEA OF UH A SHAME BECAUSE YOU'RE LOCATIONS UM
DON'T SEEM TO UH IT YOU YOU CAN WALK OVER SOME OF THEM I DON'T KNOW IT ONCE WAS
YEAH I USED TO BE THERE WERE QUITE UH PENALTIES FOR FOR THE <UNK> JOIN ONE
SO
YEAH ABSOLUTELY UM FOR YOU BUT THE MAYBE OF THE BIGGEST FACTOR SO IF YOU DECIDE REPLACE THIS IN YOUR OLD VEHICLE WAS THE PRIME CONTENDER RIGHT NOW
NO I OWN ONE
YEAH
UM-HUM
IN WHICH FUN
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
LIKE THE SUBURBS OR ONE
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL I HAD A NINE HUNDRED WHICH ARE PLAYS THE NINE THOUSAND MI- THOUSANDS ONE THE GIVE A LOT OF TROUBLE
UM
I HAPPEN TO THINK THE NINE HUNDRED IS THEY UH AND I LIKE THE MINOR BETTER AT IT HAD MORE BUT SUB- WEIRDNESS WHICH REALLY ATTRACTIVE ME
YEAH
THEY LOOKING FOR A CAR
YEAH I KNOW THAT FEELING
MINE'S ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD NOW SO DEBATING WHETHER TO RUN INTO THE GROUND
PUT UP WITH THOSE HEADACHES OR GET SOMETHING YOU KNOW
RIGHT THAT'S NUMBER ONE WELL THAT AND SAFETY
THEY SON RELIABLE
WELL I THINK YEAH THAT'S TRUE BUT RELIABILITY YOU KNOW IF IF IT'S NOT RELIABLE IT'S NOT SAFE
WELL MAYBE NOT IF YOU'RE ON THE TRENDS ALASKA HIGHWAY
UH
WELL THE SALT DOES HAVE A LOT OF GOOD FEATURES AND THE RELIABILITY IS THE BIG ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S UH
NO I HAVEN'T BUT UH YOU KNOW WITH YOU KNOW LOOKING AROUND IT DOES SEEM LIKE A ROOMY
NO GOOD HANDLING
YEAH EXACTLY
UM-HUM
OH YEAH
WELL THAT'S
YEAH THAT'S THE OTHER DRAWBACK THEMSELVES IS THEY'RE NOT REALLY CHEAP
OH YEAH A LOT OF UH OF SLIDE WAVING GOING ON
WELL THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM IF YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH THE I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO TELL WHERE THINGS ARE BUILT ANYMORE
OH YEAH UH YOU KNOW
AND IT'S PROBABLY OWNED BY UH EUROPEAN KIND A COMPANY THAT SOME PLAYING MEXICANS
YEAH
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE
UH WELL TRANSPORTATION GOES STILL COST
WELL UH I WAS I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF THE SUB NINE THOUSAND
BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW OTHER HATCHBACKS
NO WELL I HAVE IT'S A TOYOTA AND I LIKE THE TOYOTA IS
THAT'S UH THAT'S SUPER UH
SO IT HANDLES REALLY WELL SO I'M RELUCTANT TO GET ANYTHING THAT HANDLES POORLY
UM I DROVE ON NINE HUNDRED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
WAS VERY NICE
UH
YES UH I DON'T MIND UGLY
YEAH I- I AGREE WITH YOU THERE
THE METRIC SYSTEM IS IS VERY GOOD I'M UH I'M UH
DO DRAFTING I'M IN I'M AN ENGINEER AND I'VE DONE DRAWINGS AND AND HAVE TO DO CALCULATIONS OF FLUID MECHANICS AND THINGS
AND IF YOU EVER HAVE TO TRY TO DO WITH HOMEWORK DIFFERENT CONVERSIONS TO TO TO TO FIND ALL THREE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SYSTEMS WITH GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANTS
AND IT IT JUST BECAUSE IT JUST GOES ON AND ON
THAT'S THE THING IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR DRAWINGS YOU CAN SCALE UM SO MUCH EASIER THINGS BECAUSE YOU'RE INCREMENTS OF CANS SO MUCH EASIER
SO YOUR YOUR LIFE IS JUST UH SO MUCH EASIER I
I REALLY THINK THAT WHAT COULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY
IS THAT IT'S IT'S TOO INGRAINED IN OUR SOCIETY TO SHIFT IT ALL OUR PROTOTYPES ALL OUR OUR MOLDS ARE TEMPTED TO OF OUR BONES ARE THREADS EVERYTHING
THE TROLLING THE SILLIEST IS SO IT'S SO UH IN OUR SYSTEM THAT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE A LOT TO MOVE AWAY
WELL MOST OF THEM HAVE THE METRIC SET NOW BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S UH IT I THINK IT'S MORE IN THE THE THE THE THE BOLTS AND THE THREADS AND STUFF ITSELF I MEAN THAT
THE SCHOOL MACHINES AND STUFF THAT MAKE ALL THOSE THINGS THEY JUST THEY COST MILLIONS OF YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND THINGS AND THAT'S
AND I GUESS MAYBE THEY COULD BE RESELL THEM COULD BE RE- STATED THAT THE COMPANY THAT BUSINESS TO ME JUST DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT I THINK WHAT REALLY THESE BE DONE IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THAT IN THE LONG RUN THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH EASIER
OH EXACTLY ALSO TRADE YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT
YEAH IT'S UH WE NEED TO DO THAT
AND UH AS I SAID THAT THE MAIN THING YOU KNOW LIKE JUST IN THE CALCULATIONS THAT
EXACTLY
AND WHAT
OH OKAY I KNOW THAT THAT IS YEAH
YEAH IT'S
YOU KNOW IN THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPANY HAS THEIR OWN SET GUIDELINES THEY THEY THEY USE
BUT WE AREN'T IN OUR SOCIETY THE UNITED STATES IN THE GLOBAL UH IN THE WORLD
AND THE ECONOMIC SEEMS THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE
COMPATIBLES EVERYBODY ELSE WE STARTED OUT WITH THE COMPUTERS
AND WE WE'VE HAD A FIGHT TOO SOON THEY'LL JUST TO GET THEM TO BE SOMEWHAT COMPATIBLE AND THEY'RE ALL JUST GOING OFF AND AND ALL OF THIS ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
AND I GUESS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS IS THAT THE GOAL IS TO P- P-
TWO'S THE TECHNOLOGY THE COLDEST PRODUCED FOR ABOUT THE THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR IS SO POWERFUL BUT IT JUST IT IT JUST CONTROLS ARE DESTINY
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I GUESS
SO WE USE
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S TRUE
I REALLY DID LIKE FOR SO I CAN'T REALLY THINK OF WHAT THE JURORS WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE HAS TO DO WITH UH
OH I THINK THE METRIC SYSTEM
WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING FOR THE UNITED STATES HAS FOUR UH UNITED STATES BEING ABLE TO TRADE MORE USUALLY WITH OTHER PEOPLE THE WORLD
AS THE WORLD ECONOMY BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE GLOBAL
JUST HAVING A STANDARD SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S EASY TO CALCULATE WHERE SHE NOT BECOMES ONE AND ALL KINDS OF MY STUFF LIKE THAT IT IS
JUST A WONDERFUL ADVANTAGE
OH RIGHT YEAH SO YOU GET
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
OUR BUT
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT THE TOOLS OR LESS EXPENSIVE THEY
THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU THINK THAT EVERY GIRL QUARTER GARAGE HAS TO BUY A WHOLE NEW SET OF TOOLS
RIGHT THAT NOT ONLY WILL THEIR LIFE BE EASIER BUT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE MONEY SELLING THINGS ABROAD
I KNOW MISCALCULATION STAR- WHEN I TOOK FLUID MECHANICS AND
AT THE PROFESSOR WAS TELLING US HOW HE WANTS TO GIVE THE ANSWER AND I WAS HE SAID HE WANTED THEM TO THE INTEREST IN THE ENGLISH SYSTEM BECAUSE ENGINEERS NEEDED TO KNOW HOW TO USE THE ENGLISH SYSTEM
THAT I READ TO GIVE MY AUNT'S REPUBLICS
HELD BILLS WHICH IS A UM PALATABLE T- OU NBA I'LL
SO HE HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT BUT
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL THERE'S ALWAYS A CONFLICT BETWEEN INNOVATION STANDARDIZATION
AND THERE IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE TRUE THE MOST ADVANCES ADVANCED THINGS AND THE THINGS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR ANY GIVEN
APPLICATION ARE GOING TO BE NONSTANDARD
BUT
FOUR AT THE GENERALS EVERYDAY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT
THE STANDARDIZATION SUCH AN ADVANTAGE
SO AND SOME THINGS LIKE WHAT'S OUT OF THE ROAD YOU DRIVE ON
I GUESS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THAT HAD A GOOD WORKOUT
AND
BEFORE VERY MANY PEOPLE WERE DRIVING IT WAS A PROBLEM
O- O- OKAY I'M NOT
WELL I DO WORK FOR A LARGE COMPANY A LARGE READING ABOUT PULL A TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
AND UH IT USED TO BE TWICE AS BIG SO
THEY'VE BEEN UH THEY'VE BEEN BETTER OFF WITH THIS WHERE I WORK HERE IT WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND NOW IT'S TWELVE THOUSAND AND BROUGHT
BUT UH THE ADVANTAGES OF OF HOW HOW HOW BIG IS THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR
OKAY SO IT'S A HUNDRED
SOME OF THE SAME THING STOLE CLOCK FORWARD FOR COMPANIES UH YOUR SON'S BEFORE
AND SOME OF THE SAME THING SO FAR THOUGH UH ONE OF THE THINGS IS
LIKE I KNOW A GUY WHO'S GOING TO WORK FOR HIMSELF
AND
AND UH AFTER WHY HE BECAME
ISOLATED
YOU KNOW HE WAS HE CRAVED UH TRACTION YEAH
AND UH THAT'S ONE OF THE NICE THINGS UH ABOUT A COMPANY UH INTERACTION WITH OTHER PEOPLE ACCESS TO IN IN THAT UH
GIVEN THAT HAD TO GET HOOKED UP TO THIS
SO THINGS LIKE THAT HERE THAT UH ACCESS AND HAVE ACCESS TO A LIBRARY
UM
OH IS THAT UH
UH-HUH
BUT
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF A OF A UH LARGER COMPANY AND A HUNDRED IS UH COULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGER COMPANY IS
IS THE ACCESS TO OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME THING
IF YOU'RE THE ONLY COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN YOUR COMPANY THEN IT'S IT'S IT'S KIND OF ISOLATED
AND UH
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THEIR LOTS OF DISADVANTAGES COURSE BUT UH
YES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT UH TENDS TO HAPPEN
IN A LARGER COMPANY IS UH
OH HOW IS THAT UH BY HAVE ACCESS TO UH
TO PEOPLE UH THEY THEY TENDED APARTMENT WISE AND AND UH MO- WAIVERS IN AS A COMPANY OR SIZE
UM THAT'S A HUNDRED SO I- I- IN THE PAST UH HAD ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO JUST ANYTHING ANY- ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WAS UH WAS AVAILABLE
OR IS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS REFLECTED
AND I'M I MIGHT BE
YEAH AND SO WELL AND I CAN BE TEN FEET AWAY FROM SOMEBODY IS DOING THE SAME THING
I I HAVE ONE TOUR I- I DON'T KNOW IF I PUSH THE ONE ABOUT THEM ON UH
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HEAR THAT HUH OKAY BECAUSE I
ON THE PAST IS IT YOU KNOW THEY SEEM TO SHOW SOFT FAIRLY CORPORATE FRONT WONDER ABOUT THE MONEY I WANT MORE
OH THAT'S
OKAY WELL AND
THAT THAT
HUH
UH LESS OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE
UH-HUH
INTERACTION YEAH
OH WELL I HAVEN'T HAD TO UH THROUGH ANOTHER I HAVE AN EXECUTIVE ANOTHER NETWORK BUT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
ESTABLISHING OUR OWN IN A IN A FEE
UM
YEAH
WELL I THINK THE DIVERSITY OF A LARGE COMPANY IS A STRONG PAYING FOR IT UM THE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT UH WORKING FOR A COMPANY COULD TAKE YOU OF A LARGE COMPANY UM
GRANTED IF YOU'RE YOU'RE SKILLS WERE LIKE NUCLEAR PHYSICS IF YOU PRETTY MUCH NARROWED TO UH
YOUR CHOICES ARE NARROWED BUT
I CAN SEE SOMEONE WITH ON DOING WHAT I DO GOING TO MANY DIFFERENT SORT OF VENUES I GUESS YOU'D CALL THEM IN A LARGER COMPANY
UM
I'M A SYSTEMS ENGINEERING BASICALLY
DESIGNED THAT WORKS UM
SO FOR OUR AND USERS ON OUR CUSTOMERS I'M F- YOU KNOW UH
I'M PRETTY MUCH LIMITED TO THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT T- WHAT I DO
UM-HUM
YEAH I THINK WITH DISADVANTAGES IS THE BUREAUCRACY THAT POPS UP AS A YOU KNOW NECESSITY FOR ALMOST ANY GETTING ANYTHING DONE AT ALL YOU HAVE TO
UH
MANY LAYERS TO GO THROUGH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM DO YOU HAVE THE TYPICAL PYRAMID STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATION MANY WORK GROUP ONE MAN ON TOP OR WOMAN UM IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS RIGHT
UH-HUH
IF WE ARE STRUCTURED IN THE UH
IN UH IN A BALL
A- STRUCTURE
WE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WORK GROUP HOWEVER WE WORK TOGETHER
UM IT'S BY DESIGN WE'VE HAD THE SAME STRUCTURE FOR BASICALLY FOR TWENTY YEARS
AND UH IT ALLOWS US TO DO MANY INTERESTING THINGS WITH MANY FACETS ORGANIZATION
UH AND WERE ABLE TO MIX AND MATCH AND BRING DIFFERENT FACETS INTO PLAY AS THEIR NEEDED SO WE WE BASICALLY COVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF COMPUTER UH FOUR FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND UH
I THINK YOU DID
YEAH
I HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT WERE OUT OF SPACE YET MAYBE THEY DO WE DO THEIR TIME TO REFEREE
YEAH
WELL UM YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK AS LONG AS WE LATER AND UNTIL THEY TELL US I'VE USUALLY HIT THE MARKER TOO
UM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ANYWAY UH
SO WE'RE WE'RE IN UH WORD UP ALL DIAGRAM AND UH
THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY EFFECTIVE BUT I THINK THAT'S A VERY NINETIES KIND OF THING LIKE I SAY WE'VE HAD IT FOR TWENTY SOME YEARS IS SO WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT IT BUT UH
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE THESE BENEFITS AT TI
OH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ONE PROBLEM WITH UH ENGINEERING JOBS IS
IT YOU YOU REALLY NEED SOME SORT OF MORE FLEXIBLE OR PORTABLE PENSION YEAH SOMETHING MORE LIKE A A
EITHER FOREIGN LIKE IF YOU GET PART OF IT BEFORE AWAKE IT WON ALL FOUR O ONE K
WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE UH UM DO YOU KNOW PLAN THAT PEOPLE WERE PRIVATELY EMPLOYED USE
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
WE'RE ALSO SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF COMPANY SET THE BENEFITS BASED ON
YOUR WIFE'S SALARY WHEN YOU LEFT THE COMPANY
SO YOU KNOW LET'S SAY YOU'VE WORKED THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS
YOU STOPPED WORKING THERE YOU GO WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND BECAUSE INFLATION ALONE
UM YOU KNOW YOU'RE TWENTY YEARS IS WORTHLESS JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT AN INDEX FOND IT'S BASED ON THE ACTUAL DOLLAR MOUNTAINS WHEN YOU WORK THERE
YEAH
IT THAT BENEFITS IN GENERAL
UM-HUM
OH THAT'S ONE THING YOU DO GET WITH A LARGE COMPANY THERE
YOU KNOW IT'S WALKS ACTUALLY GO BOTH WAYS SOMETH- SOME WAYS YOU HAVE
MORE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS GOING ON WITHIN THE COMPANY
BUT YOU ALSO ME GET T- GOLDEN YOU WORE A EX- TYPE PERSON THEREFORE YOU SHOULD HOLDING WORK ON THIS TYPE PROJECT
THAT I GUESS ASSUMPTION DEPENDENTS LAWSUITS COMPANY AND WHETHER THE KITCHEN WHOLE PEOPLE WORK ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO IN ANY AREA THEY WANT TO
YEAH THERE THERE WAS SOME CLICKING ALONG UM I'M SURE WHAT
WHETHER THAT'S LOCAL OR SOMEWHERE IN THE LONG DISTANCE THAT WORK BETWEEN
NEW JERSEY AND WHEREVER YOU WERE
CALIFORNIA
THIS IS ALSO POSSIBLE
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEXAS AND
UM-HUM
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU GO IF YOU GO UP UH FAR ENOUGH NORTH IT DOES
I THINK IT'S CHEAPER AGAIN BUT THEN AGAIN THERE'S THE
UM-HUM
YEAH I KNOW NEW JERSEY IS
JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WHICH WAS IT'S ABOUT TWICE THE PRICES ATLANTA
BUT UH HOUS- HOUSING PRICES ACTUALLY DROPPED
YEAH UH COST OF LIVING COST OF HOUSING IS THE SALARY ANNOUNCED TO MOMMY TO DO THE ACTIVITIES I WANT TO DO
YES
OH MY WELL ACTUALLY THE TI- THE CHOOSE UH NOT FOR A WHILE I RESIGNED FROM TEXAS INSTRUMENTS NOT SHORTLY
A BILL AND FOUND THAT TO MY UH AFTER HAVING WORKED THERE FOUR
TWENTY ONE YEARS
M- MY VESTED INTEREST IN MIND
PENSION FUND WAS AMOUNT TO LESS THAN THREE QUARTERS OF THE YOU KNOW SALARIES
UM I DON'T KNOW OF THE THE UH I- I GUESS THE <UNK> THAT ISSUE WITH THE TI RETIREMENT OF BENEFIT IS IT IS WHAT THEY CALL IT TO FIND A DEFINED BENEFITS PROGRAM WHICH MEANS IF YOU RETIRE YOU GET BENEFITS
UM
IF YOU DON'T RETIRED A GOOD SHOW UP
UH BUT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SORT OF HAVE SOME KIND OF LEGISLATION SO LONG TIME AGO VISIBLE YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU COULD JUST BECAUSE OF ALL THE DON'T RETIRE
AND SO THERE'S SOME NOMINAL UH
UH WELL THE PAST THE B VESTED WITH THE EMPLOYEE
BUT UH IN THIS MODERN DAY AND AGE WHERE THERE IS JOB MOBILITY I MEAN
UH IT'S TIME FOR EMPLOYERS TO STOP SCREWING THE EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE RETIREMENT BENEFITS BYE
INVOKING WAS UH DEFINED BENEFIT SPLIT THEM
RIGHT
RIGHT
WHICH IS ALL MORE REASON I THINK THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD OF CONTROL ROOMS PENSION ACCOUNT
UM OF COURSE THE INITIAL QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED RELATED TO UM ACTUALLY I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYMORE BUT
IT REALLY DID TOO WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A POSITION OF THOSE AND CELERY AND I GUESS MY MIND BEFORE REFERRED TO BENEFITS OF MINE WAS NOT TAKING ALONG WITH POTTED PLANTS OF BENEFITS AT ALL BUT RATHER
UM
CAREER GRATIFICATION AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL I W- THERE WAS SOME SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US YOU'RE SINGLE THAT POINT YOU MISS IT
YEAH
IN CALIFORNIA
OR WHETHER IT'S PART OF THE UH SWITCHBOARD SYSTEM
YEAH
WELL  PART OF MY PART OF MY REASON FOR COMING TO CALIFORNIA WAS CALIFORNIA
UH IF IT'S GREAT I LOVE IT IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE UP TO THE PRICE OF HOUSING IS
IT'S JUST TOTALLY
OOH NEAT
LSU UP IN READING THE OF THE ONLY PRICES ARE PROBABLY COMPARABLE TO BALANCE WORKING FOR THEM BUT DOWN HERE THE HOUSING PRICES ARE
ABOUT A FACTOR FIVE HIGHER WHICH IS REALLY RIDICULOUS
AT ANY RATE
SO I GUESS ONE LITTLE THINGS YOU LOOK FORWARD JOB UH IS UH
BEFORE WILL COST OF LIVING
OF COURSE THE MOST WONDERFUL THING FOR THE COUPLE IN THE MOST WONDERFUL THING FOR THE EMPLOYEE AGES OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WAS TO WORK
NOT SO GREAT FOR THE FAMILY BUT UH
IF I'M WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TRIAL BY JURY AND WHETHER OR NOT WE THOUGHT IT WAS A A FAIR WAY TO DO IT DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE I HAVE THE UH THE JUDGE DO THE SENTENCING TO TRY TO MAKE IT MORE YOU KNOW FORMAL MORE FAIR OR ANYTHING
WELL THERE THERE IS NO UNIT IN THAT UH THE JUDGES SEEN A LOT MORE CASES AND YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU SHE'S ONE CLIMB
AND YOU CAN COMPARE THAT CRIME TO YOU KNOW HIS LONG HISTORY OF DEALING WITH WITH CRIMINALS AND UH
THE THE JURY YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR MAYBE THEY SET ON SOME OF THE JURY ONCE BEFORE MAYBE THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY SEEMS LIKE GUIDING ON TV OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND AND THEY JUST YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S KIND OF
YOU KNOW MAKING GUESSES HOW BAD THEY THINK IT IS
YEAH YEAH AS IT INFORMATIVE I MEAN HE WOULD YOU
FIGURE UP THE SEVERITY BASED ON HIS OWN PERSONAL SKILL NOTHING I WORRY ABOUT IS LIKE ONE
UM ONE MURDER WERE ARR- LET'S SEE ONE ONE PIECE
UM GETTING IT LIKE
I TEND TO THE PENALTY OF OF ANOTHER C- SIMPLY BECAUSE PERHAPS HE IMPRESSED THE JURY YOU MORE OR YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THIS PRISON TUITION WAS BETTER
YEAH
WHAT
SEE I WOULD ALMOST ARGUE W- I WOULD CONSIDER I- I- I DON'T I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT AT ONE OF THE GIRL RAMIFICATIONS TO GETTING RID OF THE ENTIRE TRIAL BY JURY AND AND HAVING THE JUDGE DECIDE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY
OH MAN
UH-HUH
YEAH BUT I THINK THE THE WE THE PEOPLE THAT THAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS TALKING ABOUT WERE RICH WHITE MEALS
I MEAN I DON'T THINK
I- I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A REAL HIGH OPINION OF OF THE MASSES MEAN HAMILTON WAS WITH A PRIME CASE YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T I THINK YOU REFERRED TO MOVE THE MIND THIS MASSIVE HE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO VOTE IN ONE AND HAVE ANYTHING IN GOVERNMENT
RIGHT
AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
WELL I MEAN ONLY ONCE AND IT SEEMED LIKE AND YOU THE STEP OF THE THINGS ON ONE PERSON WHO HASN'T VOTED AS HE WAS WITH IT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY I THINK WOMEN WANNA LOOK FOR ALL OF THAT WAS NOT VOTED IT NICKEL COLLEGE
HAS THE PROPERTY AT THE TOP OF IT WAS A
SO
UH
WELL UM
I THINK THAT UH WHEN YOU'RE TRIED BY A JURY OF YOUR PEERS THEY PROBABLY UH THE COLLECTIVE
MIND OF THE JURY IS PROBABLY ABOUT OUR VEHICLE FOR SCIENCE AND THEN THE JUDGE THEMSELVES UH BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A CONSENSUS THING RATHER THAN A UH A SINGLE PERSON
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I WOULDN'T I C- I WOULD ARGUE BACK BUT UH
A SINGLE PERSON BEING ABLE TO PASS THE SENTENCE ON SOMEONE UM LOSE IT OPEN TO HIS OR HER OWN ALL BIASES AND THEY MAY CONSIDER
OURS AND TO BE A HEINOUS CRIME IN CHILD MOLESTATION TO BE LESS SEVERE SO THE SCIENCE WOULDN'T BE ALTHOUGH YOU IN THE FORM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE UNIFORM WOULDN'T PRIMER SO THAT JUDGE AND HAMMER HERSELF
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WELL THE BIGGEST UM BIGGEST PROBLEMS I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY IS THAT UH THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
UH BASICALLY GOES BY WHO'S GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE BEST LAWYER AND UH THE PRESENTATION THIS IS EVERYTHING UM SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU COULD HAVE A REAL DIRT BALL
BE PORTRAYED BY HIS LAWYER AS A LOVING FAMILY A MAN AND AND UH CALL OF THE CALLS JURIES OPINIONS BUT UH UM I DON'T KNOW IF
WELL WE COULD DO THAT WE COULD EXPLODED TOO IT'S LOGICAL EXTREME WORDS
RIDICULOUS EXTREME AND
TAKE UH THE- NEW INTERACTIVE TELEVISION UH
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COMING FORD AND UH HAVE EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY OR ONE WHO CHOSE TO TO IT AND
DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE AND THEN UH HAVE A SLIDING SCALE OF YOU KNOW THE THE FIFTY DIAPERS OTHER PEOPLE SAID YOU'RE GUILTY THAT MEANS YOU GET IT THE LIFE IN PRISON ENOUGH UM
WE OLD OFFICE WE HAVE A GAME SHELL YOU KNOW WE KNOW THEIR IF THEIR IT DOESN'T NEED REFORM UH I WOULD WORRY ABOUT A SINGLE JUDGE UH
PASSING SENTENCE UH ESPECIALLY IN A MORE INVOLVED TRIAL UM
I- I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAD A GREAT IDEA UH AND THE THE REASON THAT WE WENT AWAY FROM THE SINGLE JOHN A CHORE THE THE THE PRI- YET I GUESS OF JUDGES THAT THEY HAVE UH IN SOME SYSTEMS IT JUST UM
YOU KNOW THEY BECOME INSTRUMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND
UM-HUM

YEAH YOU KNOW PARENTS THAT UH WATCHING NEIGHBOR SHE LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS A LOT OF UH YOUNG FAMILIES IN OUR NEIGHBORS SEEM TO BE MOSTLY RETIRED
PLUS IT'S HARDER TO TO IMPOSE AND UH YOU KNOW WOMEN THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE KIDS BUT IT'S IT FEELS DIFFICULT TO IMPOSE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE KIDS THEMSELVES
DO YOU EVER DO ANY BABYSITTING YOURSELF
UM-HUM IT'S IT IT'S A GREAT JOB
UH YOU KNOW FOR THE MOST PART UH ESPECIALLY IN OUR HOUSE IS
IT'S CLEAN AND EAT THE REFRIGERATOR STOCKED AT MOST THE TIME WHEN THEY COME OVER IN THE EVENING IT'S YOU KNOW TEN HOURS WORTH OF OF REAL CARE AND THEN THE REST IT'S JUST TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR SLEEPING CHILDREN
WE DID HAVE A ONE OCCURRENCE IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING WE HAD TWO WOMEN THAT CAME
ALTERNATIVELY UH WHEN OUR DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT ONE YEAR OLD AND UH
IT WASN'T A PROBLEM SITUATION BUT IT WAS ONE THAT JUST MADE MY WIFE SOMEWHAT NERVOUS A WOMAN WASN'T QUITE TOGETHER SHE WAS A EASILY DISTRACTED
SHE WAS NICE ENOUGH THE KIDS YOU KNOW MY MY DAUGHTER LIKED THERE BUT WE ENDED UP UM CHOOSING I TEND TO HAVE AROUND A REGULAR BASIS MAKING EXPENSES DECISION AND
IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR US SHE WAS DEPENDABLE AND AND THAT SHE WOULD SHOW UP THAT WE JUST DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE THAN WE SEE OUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE KIDS THE SAME AGE MAKING MORE EASY DECISIONS UH
I MEAN THAT UH THERE THEY SEEM TO BE PRETTY LAX AND AND WHO COMES AND AND HE WATCHES THEM
WE HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A LARGE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE UH THREE KIDS UNDER FOUR YEARS OLD AND TWINS AND HER AND
THEY'RE LIVE-IN HOUSEKEEPERS AND IT JUST ISN'T THE PERSON THAT WE WOULD HAVE EVEN TO OUR HOME ON A REGULAR BASIS MUCH LESS AND
I LIVED IN PLACES JUST DIFFERENT VALUE SYSTEMS AND UH DIFFERENT
DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS CHILD REARING
UM-HUM
I THINK I'M PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND THE FIVE ON THE SCALE THEY GAVE UH
UM I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW ANYONE BE IT WAS SORT OF GO UP TO A STORE AND BUY HANDGUNS FOR ABOUT UH YOU KNOW FORTY DOLLARS OR WHATEVER AMERICAN SHOOT SOMEONE
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT UH A HUNTING IS LEGITIMATE USE FOR WHAT THIS AND UH I ALSO SORT OF BELIEVE THAT
W- ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT IS IS VERY NICE NOW THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY DOESN'T HURT THIS RESULTS OF IT BACK UP TO HAVE SOME CITIZENS THE HAVE GUNS FOR SOME REASON
YOU KNOW SOMETHING EVER HAPPENED IN OUR GOVERNMENT WAS RUN BY SOMEONE TO DECIDE TO MAKE NON DEMOCRATIC WELL IT'S A VERY FAR FETCHED AND YOU KNOW SORT OF
YOU KNOW PARANOID IF YOU WILL POSSIBILITY BUT UH I GUESS IT'S IT'S
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS SORT OF A BAD IDEA WHEN THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE GUNS ARE THE MILITARY AND PLEASE
YEAH I MEAN I I
YEAH I AGREE COMPLETELY THERE SHOULD BE WAITING PERIOD AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO A BACKGROUND CHECK ON YOU
YEAH I MEAN MOST
YEAH I AGREE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH UH I DON'T THINK SO
YOU NEED A PERMIT TO CARRY CONCEALED HANDGUN I THINK IN SOME STATES I THINK TEXAS MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE BUT TOO SCARY YOU KNOW ONE IN THE OPEN A PERSONAL PROBLEM
UM YEAH ALTHOUGH I I ONE THING IS I THINK NO MATTER WHAT RULES YOU SAID UNLESS YOU SORT OF HAD A GOOD ENFORCEMENT OF IT WOULDN'T MATTER I MEAN THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT CAUSE TROUBLE HANDGUNS AREN'T THE SORT TO CARE WHAT THE LAW IS ANYWAY
UM AND I'M SURE THEY WOULD SURELY IT COMES TO BUY THE BLACK MARKET SO YOU'D NEED UH YOU KNOW GOOD METHODIST INSURING THAT THEY WORK AVAILABLE THERE WHICH
GIVEN THE SUCCESS OR RATHER LACK THEREOF THE POLICING CONTROLLING THE MARKET IN DRUGS I SORT OF WONDER UH YOU KNOW REALLY HOW EFFECTIVE WOULD BE I DON'T I DON'T MEAN THAT
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN I DON'T MEAN IT IS AN ARGUMENT TO NOT HAVE A WAITING PERIOD AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT I JUST NOW IS IT
SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE THE THE OLD SIT SOLUTION THAT WOULD SOLVE CRIME PROBLEMS
OH YEAH
AND YOU WOULD YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF
YOU KNOW REAL REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE WITH UH YOU KNOW EITHER PEOPLE OWNING GUNS ARE PEOPLE BEING UH A ASSAULTED WITH UH GUNS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MY DAD HUNTED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T UM
BUT UM I CAME ALONG SO WE DO WE DIDN'T HAVE GUNS IN IN OUR HOUSE THE LESS THAN THAT UH HIS PARENTS ELSE <UNK> <UNK> OR
BUT UH I DO UH OF ANOTHER STUDENT HA- I DIDN'T KNOW PERSONALLY
AT RICE UH BUT UH IT'S NOT A S- THAT UH LARGE COMMUNITY UM ABOUT A WEEK AGO

THANKS A FIGHT HIS MOTORCYCLE HOME IT WAS MADE OUT OF TELL FLOWER WHICH IS THE SAME THING TO PULL PROFESSOR MADE OUT OF AND SO UH YOU KNOW HE WAS SHOT AND HAD BUT HE WAS ON ON YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK I THINK YOU MIGHT A GUN AT A HOSPITAL ANYWAY JUST TO YOU KNOW BE LOOKED OUT BUT
UM HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CONCUSSION OR OR ANYTHING
BUT UH
IT'S KIND OF SCARY
UH HOUSTON
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AND I I JUST THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE RESTRICTION ON WHO BASK- UH
YEAH UM YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN ABLE TO WALK INTO A STORE AND BUY A GUN THEY SHOULD HAVE A WAITING PERIOD YOU AGREE
EXACTLY
AND UH AND AS FAR AS HUNTING I'M S- YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SAME THING AND IF IF YOU ARE OH UM YOU KNOW A LEGITIMATE HOT OR OR YOU JUST NEED A HANDGUN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO A TWO WEEK OR THREE WE WAIT PRETTY IS NOT GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AND IF YOUR CRIMINAL YOU NEED A GUN FOR THAT NOW AND IT'S PAELLA IS GONNA MAKE IT ALL THAT UH
BUT THEY SHOULD YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF RESTRICTIONS AND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT
THEY DON'T REQUIRE EVERYBODY TO HAVE A P- IT YET
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GUN YOU NEEDED TO YOU KNOW W- REGISTER IT AND AND
HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON IS TO WHEN I HAD IT
AND I- I D- I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY DO THAT IN TEXAS DO THAT UH
I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK SO EITHER YOU
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE
I KNOW IT DON'T MAKE IT YOU KNOW IT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO GET THEM BUT THEY STILL COOK <UNK>
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO YEAH

UH AND THAT WAY
OH MY GOODNESS SO
OH
UM I AGREE WITH YOU MIGHT
YEAH RIGHT
IT REALLY IS
BUT THAT YOU KNOW AND I HAVE ONE MY SISTER WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO YOURS TO TEXAS SHEET
I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH UH WHAT SO UM
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN WILL BEGIN
PEDIATRICS

NO I UH NO I I DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN VERY UH MOSTLY TOPPLING SINGLE
SO
YEAH I- I- IT IS I I UM
UH I DON'T KNOW I HAVE I HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS ON THE ON THE SUBJECT IS KIND OF
FOR ME THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION IS IS THIS UH REMINISCENT OF UH THAT'S THE UNDERDOG YOU STOP EATING YOUR WIFE
UM IT'S FREE SUPPOSE IS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THE THE THE THOROUGHLY TRUE FIRST OF ALL THAT YOU THINK THAT CHILD CARE SHOULD BE DONE BY OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES THE PEOPLE I MEAN BECAUSE
BUT UH UM I- I DON'T KNOW I'VE I'VE GOT MY OWN VIEWS ON UH IT IT
NO
THEY THEY'VE GOT
UM I DON'T KNOW I- I ATE TEND TO THINK THAT CHILD CARE'S A ROOMS I THINK THERE'S A
KIND OF ROOMS IN THE SENSE THAT THE IDEAS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A TWO INCOME FAMILY AND NOTHING'S GOING TO BE CHANGED YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF QUALITY TIME OVER
OVER QUANTITIES OF TIME SPENT WITH A KIT WHICH I THINK IS UH
OF THE REASONS ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THE SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO BADLY AND SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THEM IS IS JUST A JUST A TAXPAYER FINANCED BABYSITTING SERVICE
NO BUT ANYWAY THAT'S JUST ME
YEAH
THERE'S A GOOD FOR IT
UM-HUM
YEAH OH YEAH I I UNDERSTAND THAT
UH SOMEBODY WAS AT LEAST <UNK> UH THOUGH IT'S IT'S ROUGH BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S UH
UH I- I-
GETTING EXAMPLE MY GIRLFRIEND A SISTER
AS A MARRY MARRIED A UH
VERY A UH A PSYCHOLOGIST AND WHERE THEY'RE LIVING THINK THEY CAN IF YOU THEY CAN AFFORD FOR OR NOT TO WORK
WHICH SHE HAS NOT BEEN DOING SIMPLY BECAUSE SINCE THEY'VE HAD UH CHILDREN
ESPECIALLY I I THINK IT WOULD BE ALSO REALLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE SHE JUST UH TWINS OVER IN ONE AREA
YEAH YEAH
AND UH THEY
WELL I- I WORK WITH CHILDREN UM I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT NOW I MYSELF UM
BUT WE DEFINITELY DO WHY THEY HAVE UM CHILDREN AND I WORK IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SO I WORK WITH CHILDREN DURING THE DAY QUITE A BIT
UM WELL I HAVE WORKED IN FAMILY PRACTICE WHICH IN MARCH P- WAS PEDIATRICS
SO I'M
WELL AWARE OF
CHILD CARE PROBLEMS AND NEEDS
I'M A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT
UM-HUM
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT
HUM WHAT WOULD
UM WELL WE'RE TRYING TO DIAGNOSE SOME PRESCRIBED AND
UM IN SOME STATES ANYWAY THEY'RE PRESCRIBING LOTS OF DIFFERENT AND
AND THE PARTICULAR JOB THAT I RECENTLY LAST UM
THAT WAS FUNCTIONING
AS A FAMILY  PRACTICING KAREN
JUST SEEN PATIENTS OF ALL VARIETIES WHATEVER YOU'D SEE AND NORMAL FAMILY PRACTICE
PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY DID THIS UH KIDS A LOT
THEY LIKE TO SEE ME BECAUSE I WASN'T AN INTIMIDATING MAN DOCTOR I GUESS
SO A CHRISTIAN YEAH
BUT
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN
HUM
UM-HUM
WELL WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS
YOU CAN TELL ME I
AS A MATTER OF F- GRAYER AND I KNOW
KIND OF WHAT
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL I AGREE WITH YOU THERE I THINK DEFINITELY DO I
UM
EIGHT SUPPOSE
YOU KNOW YOU COULD CALLING ME A CAREER WOMEN BUT I- I DO FEEL THAT I WANNA BE AT HOME WITH MY KIDS MEANING BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT AS SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING UM
AND THAT
ALSO I KNOW WHAT A JOB TAKES OUT OF ME
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT OVER FOR MY KIDS AND I WOULDN'T WANNA DO THAT TO MYSELF  YOU KNOW
I MEAN THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE AND HOPE THEM BE CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
OH
SO I I'M WITH YOU THERE ON THE OTHER HAND THEY HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE MOTHERS AND WORK FULL TIME IN THEIR CAREERS AND I WOULDN'T
YOU KNOW EIGHT
THEIR KIDS ARE DARLING TOO AND I I WOULD HATE TO GIVE THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT AGE I AND JUDGING THEM
YEAH BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S SOME THAT ARE SECTOR FACING THEIR KIDS THE SICK OF THEIR JOB AND YOU KNOW
WHICH IS THE KIDS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER CERTAIN TESTS
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH
YEAH THERE'S NO WAY
DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ISSUE OF UH RANDOM OR SPOT DRUG TESTED
UM-HUM
YEAH I I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE JOBS WHERE UH
WHERE THE THE PERSON HAS TO SAFETY OF OTHER PEOPLE UH IN THEIR OWN HANDS ARE WITHIN THEIR CONTROL THAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY
YOU KNOW THE THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY UH YOU KNOW THE
THE DEFENSE THE MILITARY T- ANY APPLICATION LIKE THAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
RIGHT
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH AND YOU YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN EASILY ENVISION THAT ONE ONE MISTAKE COULD YOU KNOW RENTED A CAREER THAT COULDN'T BE UH IT COULD BE RESURRECTED
YEAH
NO
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
HUH
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW FOUR AT ANY OF THE
JUST ROUTINE JOBS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THAT KIND OF INVASION OF PRIVACY
YEAH
ONLY FOR THAT  ONLY FOR THE ONES WHERE IT'S CRITICAL
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH I'D I GUESS I WOULD FEEL THAT THE YOU KNOW THE POLICE
UH THE POLICE SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC UH SAFETY ISSUES WHERE YOU KNOW MANDATORY DRUG TESTING WHAT WOULD BE FAVORABLE
YEAH
WELL I'M I'M FORTY BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCE UH IN TAKING
UM DRUG TESTS LIKE YOU KNOW I PAST EXPERIENCES MILITARY
PLUS UH MY CAR AN OCCUPATION WORKING UH FOR A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR IN MASSACHUSETTS
UH I FEEL THAT IT'S UM
THERE IS SOME OPINIONS WHERE AS THE UH UH PEOPLE OF THE MIND THAT UH IT'S A RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT
NO IT'S UH IT'S A BODY FUNCTIONS INVOLVED IN THAT UH
UH PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SO FORTH BUT I DON'T AGREE I THINK THAT
UM IT'S IMPORTANT THAT DEGREE FOR SOME JOBS AND SOME JOG UP JOB OCCUPATIONS
THAT UH UM PEOPLE CAN BE SCREEN FOR IT SHOULD BE SCREAMS FOR UH FOR DRUGS THROUGH YOU UH DRUG TESTING
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH
SO I THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT THAT THAT UH UH THAT IT'S A GOOD UH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND SOME CIRCUMSTANCES TO ONE RESERVATION I HAVE THOUGH IN THAT FOR MY EXPEND I'VE TAKEN MANY URINE OUT MANY DRUG TESTS
SOME OF THEM RANDOM SOME OF THEM UM SCHEDULES
UH IN EVERY TIME YOU TAKE ONE OF THOSE TEST  YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE MANY A SAMPLE
THERE'S ALWAYS IN THE BACK YOU KNOW MINE WELL HOW WHERE UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE CONDUCTING THE TEST
THE LABS THAT A PERFORMANCE TEST HOWL ADEQUATE A- THOSE FACILITIES AND THEY UH IS IS ALWAYS IT IS IT ALWAYS THAT CHANCE I KNOW THAT WHAT THEY CALL UM BE I THINK IT'S CALLED A CHAIN OF CUSTODY
OF THE UH THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES IN ON THEM IN THE MILITARY PARTICULAR THEY IS IT DO THEY GO TO GREAT LENGTHS THAT PROTECTING BE SAMPLES BEFORE THEY GET TO THE LAPSE
BUT MY CONCERN IS AND I THINK THAT THEY THEY WHAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED
IS THE UH THE STANDARDIZATION AND THEY HAVE SOME HUNDRED PERCENT INSURANCE THAT THE TEST THAT'S GIVEN
OH THE EDP GLAD THAT PERFORMS THE OF THE ANALYSIS IS UH VALIDATED IN SOME WAY STANDARDIZATION BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SOME ARE STORES
YOU KNOW
60 MINUTES THAT AN ARTICLE ON THIS WHOLE SUBJECT SUBJECT IF YOU UH A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS UH IT WAS CAPTAIN
WHO UH HIT ALL TOOK THE TESTS HE CAME UP POSITIVE  ANY GUYS WEREN'T STACK OF BIBLE'S
NOT A MILITARY FOR A FREE STAFF STAFF AND SEE ALL WHICH IS A A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER BUT CERTAIN RACQUETBALL ENOUGH IF THE MAYOR OF MOBILE TO RANK STRUCTURE
IT'S SUCH A HIGHER LEVEL THAT LISTED PERSON ALL IN OFFICERS THOSE PEOPLE SHOW UP POSITIVE ON ONE DRUG TESTED IMMEDIATELY DISH CATCH
NOW FOR CERTAIN RANK SYMBOL ALL LIKE STARTING -ABLE ALL IF YOU'RE FOUND POSITIVE WELCOME OB- DIRTY ENDED UP ON A ON A DRUG TEST
YOU CAN BE REDUCED THE RANK FULL PICTURE PAY OR IF IT'S A REPEAT WE P- JUST OFFENSES
THEN THEY CAN JUST CHARGE
BUT THIS IS LIKE THIS THIS
IF WAS CAPTAIN HE'S WORKING NOW THAT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
AND THEY WENT BACK AND YOU KNOW FEW MONTHS LATER THEY TRY TO INVESTIGATE THE LAB INTO SAMPLED THAT HE GIVEN WAS DESTROYED
SO I- I THINK IT'D BE CAREFUL STUFF LIKE THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN ABOUT THE WHOLE ISSUE I THINK
YEAH
UM-HUM
OH I YEAH I GUESS THERE'S A BIG THING AND I- I HEAR ON THE EAST COAST PEOPLE LIKE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT UH THE POLICEMAN'S ASSOCIATION
TOOK THE UH THE BOSTON SEE SOME OF THE COURT BECAUSE THEY WEAR UM TURNING IT'S IT'S A DRUG TESTS THE COPS YOU'RE IN BOSTON
AND UM THEY WANT TO PLEASE BUT THEY DEEPLY SOC- ASIAN ONE
AND IT WAS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY TYPE DEAL WITH THE APPROACH THAT MEANT WHAT DEGREE
YEAH
OH YEAH
WELL UM DOES THE COMPANY YOU WORK FORCE TEST FOR DRUGS
HUH
UH NO WE'RE NOT BEING TESTED FOR DRUGS AT ALL UM
ARE POSITIVE FEATURES MANUAL UM THE FURTHEST TO GET THE BUT DRUGS IS IN THAT KIND OF THE MISCELLANEOUS SECTION OR IT'S REASONS FOR MEDI- DISMISSAL IT SAYS HE SAYS NARCOTIC ON COMPANY PREMISES
SO THAT'S PRETTY GENERAL BUT UM I WORK FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FIRM AND I'M AN ENGINEER THERE BUT YOU KNOW ON A LOT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SIGHT BUT DON'T OPERATE ANY MACHINERY
THE PEOPLE FOR A COMPANY THAT DID OPERATE MACHINERY LIKED REAL RATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE UNDER AND I'M MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE
I HAD A HIGHER RISK OF EXPOSURE AND BLOOD SCREENING IT'S PART OF THAT AND I I THINK THAT DRUGS THEY DO TEST FOR DRUGS IN THAT CAPACITY BUT IT'S NOT THERE EXCLUSIVE IT'S JUST PART SYSTEM THAT TURNS UP IN THE OTHER PRIMITIVE BUT THEY TEST FOR
BUT I THINK IT'S GOT A LITTLE MORE RELEVANT SINCE THEY ARE AROUND DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT THINGS AND THAT JUST EXERCISE SOME QUICK JUDGMENTS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE NATURE COMPANY'S BUSINESS
HUM
OH REALLY
RIGHT WE- THAT'S BEEN IN THAT AN ISSUE ON
IN OUR COMPANIES NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE RANDOM OR EVEN REGULAR DRUG SCREENING IS THAT THEY'LL HAVE THESE LITTLE PARTIES AND PEOPLE TO GET I MEAN I'VE MY BROTHER WAS THEY WERE WORKING TO HAVE MANY AT TIME COLLEGE IN TO COME GET ME YOU KNOW AND UM
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT SEVEN
BEER BY THE K- K- YET BUT UM I THINK THE DRUG TESTING AND I- I DON'T KNOW THEM
I GUESS LIKE I THINK IT'S GOT SOME RELEVANCE I THINK IT'S RELEVANCE IS PRETTY LIMITED I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW UP IN YOUR CASE I DON'T THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD NECESSARILY BE BUDGETS DRUG TESTING I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING POLICY YOUR COMPANY HAS A THAT TESTING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND ON THE JOB BACK AND
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
RIGHT
ACTUALLY UM THEY JUST RECENTLY STARTED A POLICY TESTING DRUGS WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE UH WHEN I WENT TO WORK FORM UM THEY DIDN'T DO THAT BUT UH SINCE THEN THEY'VE THEY'VE STARTED UP
DRUG TESTING POLICY NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN UM CONVICTIONS BUT BECAUSE THE CLASS OF OUR COMPANY ARE WERE QUESTION THAT WE DO THAT
HOW ABOUT YOU
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
OKAY
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY UM WE DO WELL WELL SERVICES SO A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS OR OIL COMPANIES BIG OIL COMPANIES AND THEY GO OUT TO
WE HAVE ENGINEERS WHO UH GO OUT THE OIL WELL TO THE TO THE CLIENTS OIL WELL AND AND WORK WITH A LOT OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT SCHOOLS DOWN THE OIL ON STUFF SO THE CLASS A VERY CONCERNED THAT
YOU KNOW THE ENGINEERS ABOUT THEIR CAR AND HEARING TO THEIR DRUG POLICY BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THEIR THEIR YOU KNOW TERRITORY NURSING BUT
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING IS THAT I WORK I'M AN ENGINEER HAVE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I WORK IN THE SOFTWARE UH HOUSE AND EVERYBODY THERE YOU KNOW OR ALTA SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THEY'VE NEVER YOU KNOW THEY NEVER GO OUT TO THE THE OIL REGS OR ANYTHING AND
YEAH WE'RE GETTING WORSE SUBJECTED TO THIS POLICY YOU KNOW THE SAME ONE THAT DOES ALL THE ENGINEERS HAVE TO JUST WELL A LITTLE DIFFERENT ACTUALLY BUT UM YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THING IT'S
BUT IT'S UH IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT I GUESS AND THEN A LOT OF DRUG POLICIES IN OUR CASE LIKE WHEN YOU HIRE ON THEY'LL TEST YOU AND THEN IF YOU GET INJURED ON THE JOB SHE LIKE TRIP AND FALL OR SOMETHING UH THEY GIVE YOU A DRUG TEST RIGHT AWAY
OTHER THAN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE RANDOM TESTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY UPSET WITH THE POLICIES FIRST PARTICULAR TOPIC UM WE HAVE A LOT OF PARTIES AND STUFF FOR THEY SERVE ALCOHOL ON THAT THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU KNOW PUT
UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY BIZARRE
UH PARTICULARLY LIKE WHERE WE ARE YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS A STORY OF A WOMAN LAST YEAR WHO ACTUALLY DID SLIP ON ICE AND AND LIKE SPRINGER ANKLE SHE SHE WAS A PERSON ELSE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE TO GET TESTED
AND I KNOW I'M AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING UH YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ON ONE HAND IT'S LIKE IT'S
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT SOME SENSE AND YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE YOU'RE I MEAN EMPLOYMENTS OR CONTRACTUAL MY NATURE ANYWAY
BUT UM
I HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING FOR JOBS THAT WERE HAD TOO UM I DO DRUG TESTED AND IT'S IT WAS KIND OF A LONG STORY BUT IT WAS IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS TOO
UM GOING IN UH BEFORE ANY THESE INTERVIEWS AND I'M WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY I'M GOING IN FOR LIKE INTERVIEWS AND SWIM IN CHICAGO AND AND UH BEFORE I WENT INTO ANY OF THE INTERVIEWS UM THEY TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR TO GET GET PHYSICALLY SUPPOSED TO BE PHYSICALLY NOW
AND UM ACTUALLY THE TOP BEFOREHAND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE IN I- I DO DRUG SCREENING

AND WHEN I GOT IN THERE I DIDN'T I WAS LIKE ABLE TO GIVE A FULL SAMPLE AND SO THEY MAY NIECES AND WAIT FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES TREAT THE WHOLE TIME A WATER BEFORE  WITH ANY OF THE INTERVIEWS
STEVE UH WITH ELECTION YEAR AND WHAT NOT COMING UP YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO CUT TAXES RAISE THEM OR OR WHAT YOU THINK
UM-HUM
SEE I NEVER THOUGHT REALLY IT'S UH
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT THAT THAT THE THE QUESTION REALLY HAD TO DO WITH WEATHER THAT WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE THE REAL QUESTION WAS IS ARE WE GETTING A REASONABLE RETURN ON ON -VESTMENT
FOR INSTANCE LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX OR SO SO YOU YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ATTACKS WERE PAYING MONEY AND AND SUPPOSEDLY THIS MONEY'S GOING INTO SOME KIND OF FUN SO THAT WHEN IT COMES ARE TRYING TO RETIRE THE MONEY TO BE THERE FOR IT
THAT'S THE YEAH I YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I SEE THAT MIGHT TAKE NOW MY PAYCHECK EACH EACH WEEK I EVERY EVERY OTHER WEEK I I REALLY THINK THAT MONEY'S HISTORY
AND YOU KNOW SO AS FAR AS AN INVESTMENT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THINKING READY TO GET EXACT SAME NUMBER OF DOLLARS BACK
UM SO WAS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS A UH UM THERE'S STILL AN OFFICE AND UH YOU KNOW STAFF WITH WITH PEOPLE THERE AND AND IN DC BUT ARE WE SEARCHING TO FIND A CURE FOR PULLEY GO
WHICH I MAY BE WRONG BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CAREFULLY EARLY FOUNDED BUT BUT SUPPOSEDLY ONCE YOU HAVE AN OFFICE IN DC OR YOU KNOW AND AND STAFF WITH PEOPLE IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO CLOSED IT DOWN AND AND IT JUST HAPPENED YET
UM-HUM
THAT MIGHT BE THE DIFFERENCE I DON'T KNOW THOUGH IS THINGS AND UH I -MEMBER CNN TV LATELY WAS UH IT HAD TO DO WITH
IT'S LIKE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE HISTORICAL SITES IN AMERICA OR IN THE HOME DISTRICTS OF VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE POLITICALLY
THAT THAT STORE FOR SOME REASON HISTORICAL SITES WITH YOU KNOW THE THE FULL FEDERAL MONEY AND EVERYTHING
SEEM TO APPEAR IS IS ALMOST AS LIKE POLITICAL FAVORS TO A VERY STRONG POLITICIANS
UM-HUM
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU UH YOU THINK THAT THAT WOULD GO SAY SOME MONEY BY UH PASSING LATVIA
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH FOR WORLD POLITICS
YEAH THE MASSACHUSETTS WASN'T THAT LI- WHEN DUKAKIS OF ANYWAY WASN'T IN THAT GREAT SHAPE FINANCIAL
UM-HUM AND I DON'T KNOW I
IT'S UM I MEAN IT'S IT'S TOUGH I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S TWO WAYS YOU CAN GONNA GO TO GET OUT OF THE FINANCES WHICH IS I GUESS YOU CAN LIKE RAISE TAXES AND THEN CRE- LIKE JOB PROGRAMS OR WHATNOT
OR YOU CAN HOPES THAT IF PEOPLE KEEP THEIR MONEY THAT FULL SPEND MORE AND CREATE JOBS AND AND WHAT NOT
WELL THAT'S THAT'S REALLY HARD QUESTION I DO KNOW THAT UH POLITICIANS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HAVING A MOUSE UM
UH IT WAS EXAMPLE UH UH A FRIEND PRESENT RIGHT NOW SAYS NO NEW TAXES WE SHOULDN'T ESPECIALLY IF ANYTHING BECAUSE IN TEXAS NOW BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION AT THE SAME TIME THE BUDGET HE SENT TO CONGRESS HAS
TAX AND SEEING PIECES SO I KNOW THE POLITICIANS AREN'T AREN'T STRAIGHTFORWARD NOW UH IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS AND NOT IT'S HARD FOR HER TO CALL IT REALLY IS
THAT'S RIGHT
YES
WELL YEAH I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE UH ABOUT POLITICS I KNOW WE HAVE A POLI- VACCINE FOR PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM GETTING POLIO I'M NOT SURE IF WE KNOW WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF JURY SOMEBODY WAS ALREADY GOTTEN POLIO
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE UH IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT BUSHES AND TRY REALLY HARD TO GET A WHOLE OF DISAPPOINTED IN DO YOU KNOW WHERE UH YOU KNOW CARS IS ABLE TO TEST ALL KINDS OF
UH FUNNY AMENDMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL UH TALKING GOSH DON'T DISTRICTS TO THAT'S THE MAIN BUT A PROPOSAL AND UH
THE POOR PRESIDENT HAS HAS TO UH YOU THEIR CULTURE JACK THE WHOLE THING
OKAY
I- I THINK THE LINE AND YOU JUST NOT NOT NECESSARILY THAT THINK ASSUMING THAT THE UH
THE THE PRESIDENT UH USES IT TO GET RID OF UH UH IN THIS KIND OF WASTE IN THE OTHER HAND UH
UH IT IT IT SEEMS TO HAVE LOTS OF CONFIDENCE YOUR PRESENT NOT TO VETO IMPORTANT THINGS
RIGHT AND JUST TO GET RID OF THE IMPORTANT THING AND WHENEVER THE THE KIND OF SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE DISPUTE AS TO UH  WHERE THEY GOT WHERE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN WASTING A NECESSITY IS
SO I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT THAT WILL HELP SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BUT IT DEFINITELY IS IS A PROBLEM WITH UH IF IF THERE'S A POLITICAL TERMS OF THE STUFF PORK BARREL OR SOMETHING
UH PORK OR POLITICS THE THE THE THE HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO DO IT I KNOW THAT THE STATE GOVERNORS USUALLY SOMEPLACE VISAS AND UH
BUT I- I LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR A WHILE AND UH WHEN DUKAKIS VETOED CERTAIN THINGS THAT WAS A BIG UPROAR <UNK> SINCERELY SO POPULAR
AT LEAST AT THE END
YE- I- THEY WERE VERY GOOD AT FIRST THERE IN VERY GOOD FINANCES AT FIRST AND UH THAT'S PART OF THE REASON HE BECAME A NOMINEE IS BECAUSE THINGS AND SO WELL AND THEN COURSE THE BOTTOM FELL OUT
WHAT DO YOU THINK UM UH ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN WHERE WOULD YOU WERE YOURSELF ON ON GUN CONTROL
MOST AND TEN BEING NO RESTRICTIONS AT ALL
UM-HUM YEAH I THINK I'D BE BE SOMEWHERE ON UH FOUR FIVE MYSELF I UM I IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THERE'S THERE'S UH
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT FAIR TO JUST KIND OF DO EVERYTHING ALL THE SAME WITH ALL GUNS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME YOU KNOW
LIKE A HAND GUNS AND AND THE FULL GRATEFUL THAT THINK OR AL- THE DIFFERENT THAN RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS
UH
AND YOU DON'T NEED THREE HAD AROUND AND THEN IT TO TO GET HOLD DEAR AND
AND IF YOU DID IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE WERE BEATEN SO  YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH AND I THINK THAT UH THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I DON'T SEE UH
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA GO PAY ALL GO HUNTING TODAY
AND USUALLY TODAY GO HUNTING IS PRETTY EARLY IN ONE ANYWAY AND THE STORE LIKE THE OPEN SO
A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD MAKES A BIG COMPANY I GUESS THE ONLY REAL QUESTION THEN IS UM IS GUN CONTROL SO THAT DOESN'T WORK I MEAN CAN YOU ENFORCE IT
UM-HUM
YEAH
I GUESS I MEAN THE ONLY THING THAT I WORK I QUESTION IS I MEAN I- I THINK IF IF IT WAS REALLY EASY TO ENFORCE THE IT WOULD BE GREAT THE ONLY THING THAT UH THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT IT
IS THAT THE ONLY REALLY I KNOW TO ENFORCE IT IS TO SOME COMMITS A CRIME WELL HAVING WEAPONS I REGISTERED YOU CAN TACK ON A COLLECTOR YEARS
BUT AS IT IS NOW YOU PUT SOMEONE IN PRISON AND THEY'RE OUT AND YOU KNOW ONCE AT THE TIME THEY WERE SENTENCED TO ANYWAY
SO I MEAN THEY'RE NOT DONE EVEN STAND PRISON WITHOUT THE EXTRA WERE YEARS ON THEIR MUCH LESS I WANTED TO BE STAYING LONGER WITH ACTORS TIGON UH
UM-HUM I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE THE I- I GUESS I MEAN I I THAT'S THAT'S GOT A PARK UNTIL ABOUT LIKE THAT IS THE UH THE WAITING PERIOD BECAUSE
I DON'T THINK THAT I MEAN I REALLY THINK THAT IF I WANT TO GET A GUN TO COMMIT A CRIME THEY'RE GONNA GET A GUN BUT UH
IF SOMEONE IS JUST LIKE ALL HOT BOTHERED AND AND READY TO GO OUT AND AND AND GET SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHARGED UP EMOTIONALLY
THAT A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD YOU NOT TO STAY THAT ANGRY FOR THAT LONG
LEAST I'M NOT
YEAH
YEAH
UH
ONE DAY MAXIMUM CONTROL ON NO CONTROL
RIGHT WELL I GUESS PROBABLY IF SOMEONE IN THE MIDDLE OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT
UH-HUH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
WELL UH NOT BUT UH AS MY FAMILY'S FROM UH SOUTH GEORGIA AND YOU KNOW THEY HUNT QUITE A BIT SO UH I REALLY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE DOWN THERE AND UH
AND UH SO I TEND TO AGREE ON THAT YEAH BUT UH
ASSAULT RIFLES YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST MADE IT
MADE TO KILL SOMEBODY YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
YEAH SO
YEAH RIGHT ARE GOING AND
BUT
UH I I'VE HEARD SOME
UH TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD OR SOMETHING UH IF YOU TRY TO BUY A FARM OR SOMETHING
AND I'LL I'LL I'LL PROBLEM OF THAT YOU KNOW THINK IF YOU GET A FEW YEAH HISTORY OF UH UH MA- CRIMES OR SOMETHING NISSAN GO INTO
AND UH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
WELL  I THINK YOU'RE EVER UP
I MEAN IF YOU CAN IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMMIT SOME WALK AROUND AND YOU GO AND YOU CAN GET A GUN AT SURELY YOU SURE DIDN'T
UH TO TO RESTRICT IT WAS CERTAINLY CUT DOWN ON THAT BUT
YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE YOU GET A GUN FAIRLY EASILY I WOULD THINK I MEAN I- I LIKE I CAN GET A GUN IN IN OUR HIGH AT THE UH THE SHOW UH OBVIOUSLY IS NOT HUH
UH GET RID OF ALL ALL YEAR UH ILLEGAL WEAPONS OUT THERE ARE DYING YOU KNOW IT DANGERS WEAPONS UH PEOPLE SCIENCE BUT UH I THINK IT UP SO
YEAH
YEAH NO SENSE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I WOULD THINK UH I MEAN I THINK GUN CONTROL OR TO SOME EXTENT CAN IT HELPS CRIME SITUATION BUT UH I THINK
I PERSONALLY MY PERSONAL LEAVE IS YOU KNOW IF YOU COMMIT A CRIME AND SHE PUNISHED AND AND IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ANY PUNISHED OR VERY LITTLE PUNISHMENT AND THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH HE'S UH
YEAH I- I AGREE TOTALLY SHE SAYS WELL THE TOWN I THINK ABOUT
WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THERE I DON'T MIND THAT THEY'LL THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY BUT IT IT YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID PAYING TAXES AND WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THAT LAW
IT YOU'RE STILL CERTAIN BANNING YOU ARE LEGAL AND YOUR CIRCUMVENTION OF THAT WA-
I REALLY I- I- I DON'T THINK IT'S A VALID ARGUMENT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE OR QUITE AWARE THAT NOTHING AT SIX PERCENT SALES TAX UM <UNK> NATURALLY SOME OF THE SOME THINGS YOU JUST CAN'T FIND IN YOUR LOCAL KMART OR A WORK UM
BRING MORE STEREO DEALER UM BUT
LOOK THEN WHY NOT UP AT THE SALES TAX TWO KINDS OF ANY CORPORATIONS HAVE TO WASH IT THAT INDIVIDUAL JUST BECAUSE IT'S JUST A STEAK CAN'T REALLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT UH BE ABLE TO AVOID PAYING SALES TAX
YES
UH AGREE IT'S IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT
BUT IT IT ALSO LEGAL
THE FREE TO DO THAT WHOLE FOR FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM REMEMBER VERY SOON THAT READINGS <UNK> IT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TRY TO LEGISLATE UH MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE
TAX TEAMS UM INTO INTO PLACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IT IS IT IS OF LOST REVENUES STREAM RIGHT NOW AND STATES YOU CAN USE ALL THE REVENUE THEY CAN GET WITH SOME WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD DO YOUR INSTILL PLOT
WHICH THEY THAT WOULD BUSINESSES DO IT AT THE PRESENT
AND I I
OH THAT'S A TOUGH HAVE BUSINESSES PURCHASING SOMETHING MAIL ORDER AND AND HAVE TO HAVING TO PAY SALES TAX ON IT
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY UM THE WAY IT WORKS USUALLY THE THE PERSON WORRYING IT DOESN'T PAY WITH BECOMING APARTMENT WILL RECYCLE THE BILLS AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND REALIZE HOW MUCH HAVE TO PAY
IN THE RESOURCES SOME SPECIAL NASTY PENALTIES UM A FEW OF BUSINESSES TRY TO AVOID THAT
A
NO THE BUSINESSES UM IT'S
PURCHASING THINGS MAIL ORDER IF I F- I'M A COMPUTER CONSULTING FIRM AND I CAN USE THIS GREAT DEAL ON FORTY SIX MOTHERBOARDS UM FROM THE FROM SAY UTAH UM
I- I MIGHT BUY THE MOTHERBOARDS ME TOM AND STILL HAVE THE PACE HAS BEEN ITSELF THAT TYPE OF COUNTING COMMONWEALTH INTO THE MONTH
BUT I THINK THAT THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT SINCE THEN AND I KNOW THEY WORK THAT WAY AND UM SAY HERE IN DC
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE UH THERE WERE A BIG HOLE DOES EXIST RIGHT NOW UM AND THAT'S CONSUMERS AND IT'S LIKE A LITTLE HIGH I FORGOT THE THERE THERE IS NO WELL TO FIND MECHANISM AT ALL AND AND THAT IS ALL OF A LO- LOST I- I THINK
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UH WONDERFUL ABUSES IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES WHEREBY YOU CAN PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER
AND AFTER THE FACT THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA CAN FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND SEND YOU A BILL FOUR THE SALES TAX APPROPRIATE TO THAT ITEM THE YOU PURCHASED AS WELL AS INTERESTING PENALTIES FROM THE TIME YOU BOUGHT IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS PENNSYLVANIA KIND OF A LINE THERE
WHAT WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE WA- THOUGH I MEAN WHAT IF YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE THE YOUR SUBJECT TOO PAINT UM INCOME TAX ON SOMETHING YOU PURCHASED OR
WELL I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
GENERALLY AT LEAST IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER IT'S NOT TO CIRCUMVENT PAYING SALES TAX TO THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IS BECAUSE
I'M SORRY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA OHIO IT'S BECAUSE I I CAN'T FIND THE ITEMS THAT I WANT AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE ANYWHERE IN MY LOCAL AREA SO I GO OUTSIDE THE AREA FOR THAT
AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TOO POLICE MYSELF AND P- PENNSYLVANIA WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE OWED
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE REVENUES STREAM WENT TO ANOTHER STATE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A AS A CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER
WELL I THINK THAT IF IF POLICY IS ESTABLISHED AND A HALF OF MECHANISM IS PUT INTO PLACE TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IN THIS FASHION
THEN I DON'T ARGUE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER TO REMEMBER THAT THOUGH I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF STATE I NEED IT IS YOU'RE ROCKS THE RECEIPT AND MAKE OUT A CHECK FOR SIX PERCENT AND SEND IT TO PENNSYLVANIA
RIGHT BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT BUSINESSES DO THAT THE BUSINESS THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS THING FROM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING APPROPRIATE SALES TAX AND FORWARDING INTO THE STATE AND QUESTION THAT'S COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE BURDEN SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE CONSUMER
UH
UH DO YOU MEAN BUSINESSES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW IS OF OF SELLING THINGS TO A CONSUMER AND THEN BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALES TAX
OR PURCHASING
NO SEE I'M I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T I NEVER SEE THAT INTO THE BUSINESS
SO MY ONLY EXPERIENCE IS BEEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CONSUMER
UM BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE IS THE BUSINESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING THEMSELVES THEN I THINK SOME WELL THE FINE MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IN PLACE OF THAT
UM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TWO FORGET THEY YOU OWE SALES TAX FOR SOMETHING UH CAN BE AVOIDED
PLAY
OH YEAH WELL I'M INTO IT UH
IS ANYBODY

OH WOW
RIGHT

THE PEOPLE AFFECTED THE PEOPLE IN THE CRIME RIDDEN AREAS ARE
MORANIS AND IN SOME CASES UH
THAN THE THAN THE PRESS WH- WHAT WHAT I'M GONNA TRY SITS THERE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO WORK VERY HARD AND I'M SURE IT'S EFFECTED BY THAT AND UH SO EVEN THOUGH I SEE
UH HOUSES THAT UH THE PROBLEMS OF CRIME IN FACT THE BLACK WORKING CLASS AND THE MINORITY WORKING PEOPLE
MUCH WORSE AND AFFECT ME UP SO THE THE CRIME PROBLEM HEFTY SOLVE ONE OF THE PROBLEM SO I SEE IS THAT
AND THEY ALWAYS COMPARE  UH AMERICA THEY SAY WELL AMERICA WE HAVE A GUN PROBLEM AND UH UH THAT
I I READ A DISCUSSION ONCE OF OF UH THE REASON WHY ANYONE FOR INSTANCE UH HAS THEIR OWN PROBLEMS IN OTHER PROBLEMS ARE SO LOW AND BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TOO THEY DON'T HAVE
THE BILL OF RIGHTS DISTANCES FOR THOSE GUYS IF YOU'RE STANDING IN THE CORNER AND SOMEBODY AND THE BODY WANTS A PC BEEN SITTING HERE FOUR BUSES OF GUN BY UH YOU'RE A PICKPOCKET INTO YOUR POCKETS
AND HE FINDS SOMETHING SINCE IN THERE THEN THEY'LL PROCEED TO YOUR HOUSE PERHAPS AND UH CIVIL HERE TORE UP AND GO ANSWER SURE HOUSE AFTER THAT THEY CAN ENTER IT ANYTIME
NOW THAT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF UH WEEDING OUT HOW SOLICITORS GETTING RID OF THE DANDELIONS BEFORE THEY'VE BEFORE THE UH POPULATE YOUR LAWN
BUT  IT IT JUST DOESN'T FUNCTION IN OUR COURT SYSTEM OVER HERE WE WE WON'T ALLOW YOU TO BE UH FIRST BUY TOP UH WITHOUT GOOD REASON
YEAH I THINK
THAT'S RIGHT AND AND LIKE I BUY A EARLIER EXAMPLE UH
UH I COULD SPEND
EVERYDAY ALL DAY JUST PICKING THE HEADS OFF THE DANDELIONS UH ONCE I GOT MY LAWN COULD INFESTED
UH
UM UM EASY NOT RECENTLY I WEAR FRAMINGHAM IS UM MIDWAY BETWEEN BOSTON WESTERN IT'S MOSTLY MOSTLY IN BOSTON THAT WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF PROBLEMS
UM BASICALLY IT'S LINED UP BLACK SOURCES WHITES AND THERE BUT A LOT OF MURDERS AND MOSTLY BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND TYPE OF THING
UM-HUM
BUT I THINK DRUGS PLACED A REALLY BIG PART A LOT OF TIMES THAT DOESN'T COME OUT IN THE PAPER ARE WELL ON THE NEWS
UM YOU KNOW THEY'RE MORE INTO AS FAR AS A NEWS REPORTER SEEM TO WELL YOU KNOW TWO BLACK-EYED SKILLED EACH OTHER OR THEY NICE BECAUSE OF OF THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE A LOT WITH UH GAIN PROBLEMS
YEAH THAT
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MAJOR THING AND WE JUST RECENTLY WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY WERE UM BOSTON WE DID YOU HAVE I WAS THINKING WE DID HAVE ONE CRIME IN FRAMINGHAM OR A GIRL PICKED UP THE GUY THE BOX
AND UH HER KIDS WOKE UP AND SHE BROUGHT THEM HOME AND THE KIDS WOKE UP AND SHE WAS DEAD SHE'D BEEN NICE TO DEATH
AND HE WAS THE HOMELESS PERSON BUT WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANNA BRING SOMEBODY LIKE THAT HOME YOU KNOW
REALLY  I THINK THAT WAS M- THE MAJOR PART OF IT TOO MUCH ALCOHOL AND SHE JUST INVITED MAN AND HE WOULD AND SO SHE WAS SLEEPING AND THEN LETTER A- BUT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
HUM
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK THAT'S MORE I THINK THAT'S WAS A LOT OF GOOD CHANGE BECAUSE THEY FOUND UM HOW MANY PEOPLE OF WE READ ABOUT OR HEARD ABOUT THE NATIONAL NEWS THAT THEN PICKED OUT BECAUSE OF A TECHNICALITY THERE LAST LET OFF
YOU KNOW AND THAT'S REALLY NOT RIGHT AND THEN THEY GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM NO I HAVEN'T BUT IN MY JOB I'M A NURSE AND WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE I MEAN YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WORLD THAT THEY CAN DO THAT
ANY TIME UH I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHOEVER HAS BEEN PICKED OUT
AND BEING TESTED
DO THEY CAN IF THEY CHOOSE TO YORKER RIGHT
HAVE YOU WELL IT HAS TO BE HONEY -PERIENCE WITH THAT UM
UH-HUH
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
RIGHT RIGHT SEE I KNOW OF THAT TOO
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE IN HOUSTON AND SUDAFED THINGS LIKE THAT CAN REALLY THROW IT OFF AND YOU CAN NOT GET A JOB
BECAUSE OF IT AND THEY MAY NOT TELL YOU THE REASON WHY
UH-HUH
SEE AND SO IT REALLY IS A DANGEROUS THING THAT WAY BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEBODY THEY TESTED FOR ANY I LINE AND DIDN'T GET THE JOB AND
THEY WANT TO HOLD W-
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE REASON WHY I ASK YOU TAKE IT IS A COU- WILL BE BECAUSE OF THE DRUG TESTING
WHERE THEY WOULD TELL YOU OH THIS PERSON NEVER USE ANY DRUGS
UM YOU SHOULD BECAUSE HE SHOULD BE GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE OR AT LEAST
ABLE TO JUSTIFY IT OR SOMETHING I HAVE REAL MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I GREW SEE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT I KNOW THEY'RE A LOT OF THINGS THEY CAN INFLUENCE THEM IN I THINK THAT A PERSON DOES ARMS
A SECOND CHANCE WITH THAT OR SOMETHING BECAUSE MOST SINGLE STAYING SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME
YOU'RE AND IF YOU COULD SHOW THAT I I INTERVIEWED FOR A JOB RECENTLY AND I THINK IT AND TAX
AND I GOT YOU GAVE ME A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT HE SAID THIS WAY IF IT WHERE TO MAKE THE DRUG TEST POSITIVE YOU HAVE
PROVED THAT YOUR DOCTOR WHAT IT JUST FOR YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AND IT DIDN'T COME OUT THAT I NEEDED TO DO IT BUT
THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AND AND THEY WOULD JUST SAY OH THIS PERSON'S DRUG TESTED POSITIVE WE WANNA HIRE THEM
OR YOU KNOW THEN YOU COULD LOSE OUT ON THE JOB WHEN REALLY YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
SURE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I'M NOT SURE EITHER THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE IT IS THAT IF THEY REALLY SUSPECTED PERSON IS USING IT
THEN THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND APPROVE IT BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY CAN SPOT CHECK
YEAH
SO IT'S SORT OF BEDS AND THIS IS THAT THIS I'M NOT REAL SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT
FROM TWO WAYS YOU KNOW AS A WHOLE PROFESSIONAL I WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY TAKE CARE OF ME THAT WAS USING DRUGS
YOU KNOW SO THAT'S A PATIENT I FEEL WELL YEAH WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE PROTECTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
I SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THAT THEY DON'T TEST MY PATIENTS WERE TOO SO  YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU SO IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRIED SOMEPLACE ALONG THE WAY
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND TESTING EVERYBODY FOR EVERYTHING
SO I DON'T KNOW AND I- I THINK IT COULD BE USED TO HASSLE SOMEBODY IF SOMEONE WAS OUT TO GET YOU
I THINK THAT A COMPANY OR BOSS COULD USE THAT YOU KNOW THEY COULD KEEP ON DOING THIS TO YOU OR SOMETHING I GUESS I CAN SEE WHERE IT COULD BECOME A PROBLEM
REALLY
OH WOW
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING YOU GET SEVERAL YEARS AGO
THAT'S THE OTHER THING I MEAN A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AS KIDS OR YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE GET INTO SOME THINGS THAT
THEY GET OUT OF LATER ON AND I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD REALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT FOR UH
YOU'RE
SURE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO THAT WE WOULDN'T BE TOO GOOD EITHER
UH HAIR BEEN TESTED FOR A NEW JOB OR ANYTHING
SO IT'S JUST SORT OF UM THEY CAN IF THEY
YOU KNOW OKAY
UM NOT REALLY BUT I'VE ALWAYS WORKED ALL UNIVERSAL BUT A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAD TO BE TESTED BEFORE THEY GOT SUMMER JOBS AND STUFF
UM I DON'T
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY AFTER IT BECAUSE I MEAN I KNOW THEIR LIFE STYLES CHANGE THE PRIOR TO THE DRUG TEST ME NO THEY CHANGED AFTERWARDS
YEAH I- I HAD A FRIEND
A DIDN'T BECAUSE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THEIR JOB BUT IT CAME BACK THAT YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR USING A SOLUTION ENGINE
BUT THE WHAT WAS WAS SHE DID YOU SHE'D BEEN UM IN THE JUNGLE AND IT WAS A MALL AREA MEDICATION IT'S YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR THAT
I ALWAYS I THOUGHT THEY GET YOU GOT CALLED BACK IF YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR MORE TEST
HOW ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THEY ARE ARE THEY I MEAN IS THERE MARGIN OF ERROR
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH I'M NOT I'M NOT SO SURE THERE AREN'T THAT NEEDED I MEAN
YEAH IF YOU USE IT
WALL UH JOB LIKE IF YOUR PROBLEM BUT TOO CASUAL PERSON THAT IT'S ALMOST BY ITSELF INFRINGEMENT OF YOUR PRIVACY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT IT'S LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE NOW THEY HAVE TEST IS THEY CAN TEST YOUR HAIR AND THEY CAN FIND OUT IF YOU USE DRUGS UP TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO
SO
RIGHT NOW

YOU CAN'T SAY WAS WRONG AT THE TIME
I DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR UM IDEAS ABOUT OUR FUNDING OF A TREES
DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT IN CANCER SOMETHING ELSE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE THE NUMBERS ARE SO LARGE
RIGHT
BECAUSE THAT'S WELL LEAPS TOO YOU KNOW I HAVE UH SCHOOL AGE KIDS
I- I THINK UH A GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD GO TO THE EDUCATION WE STAYED AT SEEM TO BE DOING
I BECAUSE I THINK YOU WANNA STOP IT BEFORE IT GETS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE KIND AT REVERSE YOU YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT BEFORE IT STARTS
INSIDE ME UPSETS ME TO THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE A LOT TO DISEASES AND IN MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY THERE'S A GENETIC DISEASE
WHY PEOPLE MAKING A STINK ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW AND CARING YOU KNOW MAKING THEM GUNG HO RALLY TO CURE THAT UH
IT JUST HERE ALSO
OH I'M SURE IT'S DEVASTATING
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE REAL F- SCARE REAL FEAR YOU DON'T KNOW

THAT'S GOOD THAT'S A YEAH OH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE OF I'M A WORKING IS IT IS UH CRUCIAL TO THE JOB
UH WE HAVE SOMEWHAT W- W- SOMEONE THE SAME SITUATION UM I MEAN I FEEL I FEEL A LOT ABOUT TAKING ANY PERSONAL TIME ANYWAY UNLESS YOU KNOW THEY DO ABOUT IT OR WHATEVER BUT UM
BY BEING A SALES ORGANIZATION WE YOU KNOW OUR TIME IS OUR OWN UM THEY WERE KIND OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS UNDER A COMMON COLD TYPE OF THING
SO IT'S KIND OF THE SAME SITUATION WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR OFFICE STRUCTURE THAT IS MORE STRUCTURED AS AN OFFICE TIME
UM BUT YOU IT'S NOT SO WE DID THAT YOU KNOW YOU PUNCH O'CLOCK THAT TYPE OF THING
AND
A TURN MINE ABOUT TWELVE HOURS EARLY THAT MOVIE
ARE YOU YOU DID
NOT YOU KNOW YOU

THEY WHAT WE CAN DO IS UH I CAN PUNCH THE UH ONE THOUGH AFTER FIVE MINUTES WHEN THEY UH UH VOICE BECAUSE UM WE BROKE ALL NIGHT IF WE WANT  OKAY
UH I LOVE THE IRONY OF UH
TALKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT ON APRIL FIFTEENTH
BUT UH I'M AFRAID I'M I'M PROBABLY IN THE MINORITY I'VE ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THAT WE UH PAY TOO MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY
IF I AGREE WITH YOU I'M PARTICULARLY UH IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WERE UH I GUESS
I DO HAVE A UH A BONE TO PICK WITH UH UH THE WAY TAX OR DISTRIBUTED
UM I JUST FINISHED FUMING AT THE FACT THAT WE PAY AND AND A HALF PERCENT SALES TAX AND NO INCOME TAX ONE INCOME TAX COULD'VE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM UH FEDERAL FORM
AND UH SALES TAX CATS I THINK THAT'S REGRESSIVE AND UH
UM
IT'S KIND OF DUMB
WELL I MEAN NOBODY TAXES GROWING ANYTHING WHERE YOU
UM-HUM IS THAT RIGHT UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT I GUESS WHEN I HEAR IT WHEN I SEE THE COMPARISON BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND UH ANY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY
UH THAT THEIR RATES ARE LIKE UH FORTY ONE FORTY TWO AND OURS ARE LIKE THIRTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN
YOU KNOW IF YOU COMPUTER AS THE PERCENTAGE IS TOTALLY INCOME ALL TAXES PUMP TOGETHER WE ACTUALLY DO PRETTY WELL
UH THERE'S NO OTHER COUNTRY THAT'S THAT IS TAX AS WELL AS WE ARE
YEAH
UH-HUH
I'M I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND I MEAN
YEARS RIGHT
YEAH OH YOU MEAN LOWEST IN THE LIVING IN SPITE OF LOW A HIGHER HIGHER TAX RIGHT YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE YEAH UM PROBABLY MORE LESS SO NOW THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR WHATEVER BUT SINCE
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH SO IT'S UH
I THI- MY KIDS BROKEN SCHOOL THAT'S
RIGHT YEAH IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT QUITE THE BARGAIN IT
BUT I MEAN I PAY THEM GLADLY THAT'S A DECISION I THINK IT'S A DUMB DECISION ON OUR PART BECAUSE
COUNTRIES LIKE KIND OF IN A MAN IN GERMANY DO PERFECTLY WELL WITH A UH TWO TRACK SYSTEM IN WHICH RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS COEXIST WITH SECTOR SCHOOLS FOR THE STATE TAX MONEY
BUT UH I MEAN THAT'S THE THAT'S THE WAY THE MARKETS ONE CORPORATE I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT
BUT YEAH I- IT AND IF I WERE UH WHEN I WAS SINGLE AND AGAIN WHEN I'M RETIRED I WILL NOT MIND PAYING UH WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP SCHOOLS GOO- THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CAR AT NIGHT
I JUST YEAH THAT'S TRUE I THINK IN PLACES I THINK IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO FIND THAT IN IN AREAS THAT ARE FAIRLY WELL OFF
IF YOU HAD THE UH UH PEOPLE VARIOUS ACTUAL PERSUASIONS IN THOSE NEVER INTEND TO MARRY AND THOSE WHO ARE RETIRED AND THOSE WERE UH JUST LOOKING FOR ON THE PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A SMALL MINORITY THAT THEY CAN'T GET A TAX BILL PASSED THE MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
AND UH  THEY'RE BIG SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WERE DEEP AL- WITH CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE IS SUCH A SMALL MINORITY THAT THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT SEEMS SO
UH LIKE A CULTURAL LAPS I MEAN PEOPLE ALWAYS USED TO BE WILLING TO ANTE UP FOR THE SCHOOLS THERE
RIGHT YEAH PEOPLE WOULD RATHER UM INCREASED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND CUT THEM THE SCHOOLS THAT MEANS MORE TRUE
BUT I THINK IT'S UH
ROSE SELFISH AND SHORT SIDED YEAH UM-HUM
SO
NOT
I DON'T I FINISHED MINE UP ABOUT ELEVEN UNLESS IT WAS CAROLYN SO I HOPE HE TURNED IN
I JUST  GO AHEAD OFF UP EATING THAT VERY OFTEN UNIVERSITY ICEBERG ON THE UNIVERSITY
OKAY GO AHEAD
FIRE AWAY
I AGREE WITH YOU
I HATE SEEING A HALF PERCENT SALES TAXES ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T MIND IT'S ONLY ON
YOU KNOW THINGS THAT AREN'T
LIKE GROCERIES THAT IS NOT ON THEM
OH YEAH THEY DO
YEAH OURS ON UH
UH-HUH
WE HAVE A PRETTY LOW INCOME TAX THEM INTO A TAX FREE HERE ALL I THINK THAT THE SALES TAX HE'S GOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
BUT THAT'S THE POLITICAL LESSONS TRYING TO NOT CREATE ANY NEW TAXES
WELL AND I STILL THINK HAVING LIVED IN EUROPE FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW <UNK> DEFENSE AND LIVING CONDITIONS ARE CERTAINLY WELL WORTH UH WHAT WE PAY FOR
WELL I MEAN I THINK I DID IN GERMANY YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS
NICE AND A LOT RATHER PAY TAXES HERE AND HAVE WE HAVE BEEN HAVE TO LIVE THERE
HIGHER TAXES YEAH
IT'S JUST THAT WAY TO SOME EXTENT
KIND OF THE OTHER PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S EASY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TAXES BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING YOU THEORETICALLY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT
BUT I LOOK FOR EXAMPLE THEY YOU KNOW THE QUESTION SITUATION IT'S LIKE SCHOOL TAXES FOR ME BECAUSE BARGAIN IN THE WORLD SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY ANY MORE FOR FOR MY PHYSICIANS IN A YEAR AND I HAD TO PAY FOR ALL OF MY SCHOOL TAXES
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE TOUGHER ROUGHING IT
NO I MEAN IT'S JUST YOU THOUGH
YEAH
BECAUSE I THINK WITH A GRAIN OF AMERICA WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT PROBLEM LOTS OF PLACES
OR BUILD ROADS
UM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT UH AT WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME AND UH
SOME SACKS THAT I'LL BE READING VERY SHORTLY GO TO WORK IN OUR DIFFERENT STUFF SO ARE PRETTY MUCH UH
A LATER STUFF TO WHERE I DON'T HAVE THE FAMILY TIME UH WHEN MY HUSBAND GETS HOME IT'S USUALLY HE'S HOME WITH MY DAUGHTER ALONE AND THEN UH A COUPLE HOURS LATER I'M HOME
UM I DON'T KNOW I'M FINDING THAT MORE MORE PEOPLE THAT I'VE TALKED TO THERE'S LESS OF A FAMILY TIME AVAILABLE TO THEM AND UH IT SEEMS THAT BUSINESS W- UM
IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY OR YOUR EMPLOYER'S SEEM TO BE TAKING MORE MORE TIME AWAY FROM THE FAMILY
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU DO HAVE ANY TIME IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN A REST CYCLES IF YOU HAVE TO GET SO MANY OTHER THINGS DONE
UM JUST JUST TO MAINTAIN YOUR HOME AND MAINTAIN THE THINGS OUTSIDE YOUR HOME AND THEN PLUS TRIED TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR CHILDREN
AND IT IT SOMETIMES AND VERY IT'S IT'S A VERY HARD JUGGLING ACT
AND
YOU KNOW I LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER AND SHE'S NOW UH FOUR GOING TO BE FOUR IN THEY KEEP SAYING LET'S SEE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME WITH THEIR HOUSE
AND SEE THE GUY THAT SENSE
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
YES
YEAH
SURE YEAH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
SURE
UM-HUM EXACTLY
UM-HUM
SURE SURE
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
SURE
SURE
SURE YEAH I I AGREE
I THINK SO TOO
IN FACT UM I THINK THE FIRST THREE YEARS AT HOME WITH MY DAUGHTER SO I- I GUESS THAT'S ALL FAIRLY FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT AND I DID NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH UH INCEN- STEAM PLACED IN DAY CARE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HOW CAN A MOTHER
PLAYS THE CHILD AT THE AGE OF SIX WEEKS OF FOUR WEEKS OR TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS WHATEVER THE THEM PLAYERS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE BACK TO WORK IS BASICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE BACK TO WORK WHETHER IT BE SIX WEEKS OR THREE OR FOUR BUT HOW THESE WOMEN MONTHS
FEEL THE PLACE THEIR CHILDREN IN DAY CARE AND YOU KNOW IT'S OUR SOCIETY SAYING YES THIS UM YOU NEED THIS JOB
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FINANCIAL TYPE THING BECAUSE I- IF YOU LOOK ALL OVER ANY OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE EUROPE AND THAT UM THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING ARE A LOT LESS THAN WHAT OURS ARE IN THAT PART OF IT TOO BUT
UM LIKE MY HUSBAND WAS SAYING MAYBE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE BROUGHT ON FOR ITSELF IS THAT THESE WOMEN BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES UH WE'RE STAYING AT HOME WITH THEIR KIDS
AND THEN MADE THE DECISION WHILE SHE'S YOU KNOW GO OUT AND GET A PART-TIME JOB GOT A PART TIME JOB AND THEN FINANCIALLY THEY GOT THEMSELVES AND SAY WELL I HAVE THE BOAT SO HAVE THE CAR AND THAT'S NICE
AND REALLY WOMEN PAST GENERATION WOMEN HAVE DONE IT A WOMEN'S OF THIS DAY AND AGE TOO
UM BECAUSE IT IS NOW OUR FINANCIAL SITUATIONS OUR ALLIES
IT'S ALMOST TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO BRING IN IT ENCOMPASSES SUPPORT A FAMILY NOW AND
UM-HUM
SURE I DID IT FOR THREE YEARS IN DAY COST US A LOT OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF DOING IT
AND PRETTY SOON YOU KNOW YOU'RE AT THE LIMIT WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO SAY OKAY YOU SACRIFICED FOR YOU KNOW SO MANY YEARS AT HOME AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY FURTHER YOU KNOW ALONG
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO BACK TO WORK PART-TIME EVER GO BACK TO WORK FULL TIME YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IT'S A TOUGH ONCE AND I
UM-HUM
SURE
I AGREE
YEAH
I KNOW THAT I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND UM I STAY HOME I DON'T WORK
AND UM I KNOW THAT IT IT MUST BE REALLY CHALLENGING TO UM TRY TO JUGGLE A JOB AND AND ALSO YOUR CHILDREN BECAUSE I KNOW MY HUSBAND IF I WERE GONE AS MUCH AS HE IS
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE INFLUENCE ON THEN THAT I WOULD WANT TO PUT ON THEM
AND I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE CHILDREN THE COME OVER HERE TO PLAY THAT GO TO DAY CARE EVERYDAY
THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE AROUND A DEAL
THEY DON'T WANNA PLAY AROUND A DON'T THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND YOU AND THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO THEY WANT TO DO THEIR OWN THING AND THEN THE VERY SAME AGE AS MY CHILDREN
AND I'M FINDING AS I VOLUNTEER UP AT THE SCHOOL
I JUST IT BEANS UM I'M NOT EDUCATED ALL IN UM REALLY DETECTING THIS BUT I CAN TALK TO THE TEACHER AND TELL THEM ON A PRETTY GOOD BASIS AFTER I WORKED UP AT THE SCHOOL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHICH KIDS GO TO DAY CARE WHICH COULD STAY HOME
AND YOU CAN JUST TELLING THEIR PERSONALITIES AND HOW THEY RESPOND TO DO YOU GO
THAT UM THE ONES THAT ARE ARE HOME AND THE ONES EVEN THAT ARE HOME BETTER GETTING AND UH LOVE AND ATTENTION THEY NEED
NOT THAT THE KIDS THEY GO OUT ARE GETTING THAT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE USED TO BEING WITH THEIR OWN AGE KIDS ARE NOT USED TO BEING WITH THE DOLPHIN TO RESPONDING TO AT ALL
UM I THINK THE TREND IN THE UNITED STATES I FEEL REALLY BAD THAT IT'S TURN SO MUCH TO WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE UM
RIGHT
RIGHT
IT'S HARD IT REALLY IS HARD I KNOW THAT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE TO DO A LOT OF SACRIFICING TO KEEP ME HOME AND UM
RIGHT
RIGHT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT TOO THOUGH IS UM STAND HOW THEY SPEND THEIR TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN
I THINK WITH WORKING MOMS IF YOU CAN GET THEM THAT THE BOSS IS TO GIVE YOU ALMOST LIKE UH ROTATION LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH YEAR AROUND SCHOOL WHERE YOU WERE
-KAY  UM I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE SITUATION YET
YOU KNOW MY MY PARENTS THEY'RE NOT QUITE AT THAT AGE YET SO I HAVEN'T
NO NO I HAVEN'T UH REALLY BEEN IN THAT SITUATION ALTHOUGH THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER THAT UM
THAT'S REALLY ABOUT IT HAVE THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION YOU HAD A
UH-HUH
IT REALLY
YEAH
OH HUH

AND I'M SURE IT IT'S EXPENSIVE
YEAH

YEAH MY MY GRANDMOTHER IS NOT A NURSING HOME BUT SHE'S IN UH I KNOW THEY'RE LIKE UM  THEY'RE APARTMENTS FORCE SENIOR CITIZENS
AND SHE LOVES THAT BECAUSE THE DATE A RANGE ACTIVITIES FOR THEM ALL DAY LONG AND THEN THEY HAVE UM WHERE THE BEST TAKES THEM MATH AND TAKE SOME WHERE THEY NEED TO GO
AND SHE SHE SHE REALLY DOES SO THAT BUT SHE'S JUST CONCERNED ABOUT
AND
IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW SHE SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT GONNA BE LIKE ALL THE TIME AND SHE'S JUST WONDER WELL WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME AND AND I YOU KNOW IT I GUESS SO NORMAL TOOK START TO WONDER ABOUT THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESN'T NEED THAT BUT
YOU KNOW SHE'S KIND OF ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WELL WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN YOU KNOW THIS CAN'T LAST FOREVER
SO
YEAH I EAT
YES SHE CAN'T BUT I- I THINK IT IS ALSO CAFETERIA FACT BUT I BUT I I'VE I TI SHE REALLY COOK FOR HERSELF
SO UM
BECAUSE I I'M IN A HURRY THEIR LETTERS TELL ME SHE SAID GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR COFFEE OR SOMETHING TO EAT SOME OF THEM IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
UM-HUM AND SHE LIVED BY HERSELF TOO SHE SEEMS TO LIKE IT AND UM MY HUSBAND'S GRANDMOTHER IS
AND SHE WAS SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME AND SHE DOESN'T REALLY NEED TO CARE ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT SHE HAD YOU KNOW HOW UM INCH THICK YOU DOING REALLY WELL I'M REALLY PROUD OF HER SHE DIDN'T REALLY WOW
SO
WE HAVEN'T HAD TO DO ANYTHING BUT THEN AGAIN SHE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM I MEAN SHE'S GOT A MOTHER INTEND TO DO THAT SO HOPEFULLY WE WON'T NEED TO GO THAT ROUTE SO
YEAH
THAT'S NOT QUITE ELDERLY HUH
UH-HUH
I'M NOT FOR MY PARENTS BUT I- I WAS AROUND I HAD TO SET THE GRANDPARENTS
UH QUITE A BIT WE WE PUT ONE THAT THE ONE GRANDFATHER IN A REST HOME
AND
THEY KILLED HIM  WELL YEAH I KIND OF WELL THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS INVOLVED BUT IT BEFORE HE WAS REALLY ACTIVE AND
AND UH IF THERE WERE SOME YOU KNOW HE LOST A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND THAT CAN GET AROUND AND WASN'T ABLE TO DO SOME THINGS AND SO END OF JUST HAVING TO PUT HIM IN A REST HOME
AND HE JUST KIND OF BECAME VEGETABLE AND DIED
SO IT'S WITHOUT A LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS UH BACK IN LIKE SEVENTY THREE
SO UM I THINK THE WAY THEY DID THINGS WERE A LOT DIFFERENT BACK THEN <UNK>
AND UH
MY GRANDMOTHER HIS HIS WIFE UH WE ALSO PUT HER IN A REST HOME HE'S IN A REST HOME AND SHE WAS BACK OUT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO BE THERE
AND UH HAD A PHYSICAL HAD A GOOD PHYSICAL THERAPIST OF THAT PLACE
AND THEY WORK WITH HER AND
GOT HER WALKING AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THINK EVER SELF AND SO SHE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK HOME
AND THEN SHE HAD TO GO BACK IN A COUPLE TIMES
BUT MOSTLY WAS JUST BECAUSE SHE KIND OF GAVE UP
AND THEY GOT ARE GOING AGAIN
SO I GUESS AS FAR AS LOOKING NICE AND THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A THINKING TO LOOK FOR AN ACTIVE
UH-HUH
OUR AND INTERACTIVE STAFF
SOMEBODY WHO WILLING TO WORK WITH UH YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE PATIENCE TO DO THINGS WITH THEM AND TREAT THEM TREAT THEM LIKE JUST
IT IS
IT IS EXPENSIVE
UH-HUH
OH UH-HUH
UM-HUM

WHEN SHE CAN'T TAKE CARE
UM-HUM YEAH
UH-HUH
DOES SHE HAVE UH IS IT LIKE THE KIDS AND THAT TYPE OF CARMEN WHERE SHE CAN'T FIX OUR OWN FOR THAT SHE WANTS TO US WE CAN GO DOWN TO THE CAFETERIA
UH-HUH
MY EYES
UH-HUH
YEAH I'D I REALLY LIKE THAT CONCEPT THEY THEY HAVE A FEW OF THOSE UH QUITE A FEW OF THOSE PLACES LIKE THAT HERE IN UTAH AND UH THAT YOU KNOW I
COUPLE OF THEM YOU KNOW THE WIFE CAN CAN LIVE THERE TOO OR OR WHATEVER IN IT AND THEN AND YET THEY HAVE THEIR THE FRIENDSHIPS THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT
YOU KNOW GETTING TOGETHER NEEDING TOGETHER AND ALL THAT
RIGHT I THINK IT REALLY TAKES UM
YOU KNOW TH- LOOKING MORE THE PEOPLE THAN THEY'VE BEEN REALLY THE FACILITIES
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I- I THINK THAT THAT'S THE THING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT TOUGH ABOUT PUTTING THEM IN A REST HOME IS IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY PUT THEM OUT THE PASTURE
AND SOME SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER REALLY ACTIVE THEY THEY WANTED TO DO THINGS THAT AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY WANNA GO DOWN PLAY BINGO OR UM
YOU KNOW PLAY WITH YOU ARE
I START
OKAY UH BASICALLY I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND OUR HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN SEEMS TO BE OKAY BUT THE C- THE BENEFITS ARE ARE YOU ROTATING IN THE COST OF INSURANCE GOES UP
UH I DON'T KNOW WHY THE POLLS PEOPLE POST OFFICE PEOPLE PAY ONE THIRD OUT OF THEIR PAYCHECKS FOR THE SAME INSURANCE THERE WERE GETTING
UH RIGHT NOW I'M IN THEIR PHYSICIANS HEALTH PLAN AND IT COST ABOUT THIRTY FIVE BUCKS A PAYCHECK
BUT YET THE POLLS TO PEOPLE WOULD BE LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS A PAYCHECK
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY YET SO IT'S A PRINTER ONE PERCENT AND I'M SURE NOT EVERYBODY HAS A PROBABLY DID THEIR DOS WORSE THAN
SENATOR MASTERCARDS CHEAPER TOO
UM-HUM
GOSH YEAH SIXTY ONE
UM-HUM
I AGREE THERE BECAUSE I YOU KNOW SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO PLAY BASEBALL A BREAK YOUR ARM YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA COST YOU FI- X-RAYS AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AT SOME TYPE OF HEALTH PLAN THAT YOU CAN AFFORD
AND I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO WHERE THEY CAN NOT TO SAY OKAY I CAN AFFORD FIFTY BUCKS EVERY PAYCHECK FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
AND I KNOW I WAS IN WHEN I WAS IN GERMANY I WAS IN THE SERVICE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A RE- GREEN THAT THAT WAY IF YOU WENT TO A HOSPITAL THERE GERMANY THAT THEY DID THEY CAN STILL LOCAL FAN FOR THAT HOSPITAL CARE
SO THEN GIVE US A HASSLE THAN A PHONE AFFORD TO GET MEDICAL CARE THERE
AND MY BROTHER MY DAD OVER THERE AND IT'S A GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN FOR THEM
I THINK IT'S GONNA COST US MONEY AS FAR AS TAXES THAT ARE GONNA GETS INTO IT BECAUSE THEY REALLY I'M SURE REAL GOOD RECORD FROM AS WHAT OF ANY KIND OF PROGRAM
WELL PRETTY IGNORANT ON TAXES BUT ON SELF EMPLOYED DO YOU GET ANY KIND OF CREDIT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE
UM-HUM
AND UH CONSUMER THEM PAY IN THE IN THE MATTER WHAT HAPPENED SO
JUST W- COST HIDDEN OR NOT
SURE
IT'S CALLED THE UNION
WELL
OH I AM ALL FOUR UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE UM BEING UP HERE IN NEW YORK UM
OUR LOCAL BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD PEOPLE HAVE
I'M I'M NOT PAYING EVERY MONTH BECAUSE I'M SELF EMPLOYED ONE HUNDRED AND THREE DOLLARS A MONTH
FOUR BASIC HEALTH CARE COVERAGE
UM ACTUALLY I'M SORRY IT'S MORE THAN WELL FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A QUARTER
SO IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT
AND
FRANKLY I DON'T I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKE WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN CANADA AND GIVING EVERYBODY A CHOICE AS FAR AS WHO THEY WANT FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE
FRANKLY I THINK THE THE REASON WHY WE'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE AND AND SUCH AND ANTICOMPETITIVE UM
UH STAMPS RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS DOING THAT A WITH THESE OTHER COMPANIES IS THAT WE ARE REALLY BURDENING ARE AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS WHICH THEY HAVE TO BUILD INTO THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCTS
WHERE AS IF YOU GO TO SO ONE OF THESE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES JAPAN FOR EXAMPLE WITH A GOVERNMENT PAYS ALL OF THAT
DO YOU WANT TO BUILD IT INTO THE COST OF YOUR PRODUCTS UM THEY USUALLY NAIL THE P- YOU KNOW YOU PAYS AS AN INDIVIDUAL
VERSUS UM HAVING A COMPANY DRAGGED ON BUYING HE'S INSANE HEALTH CARE COSTS
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET ACCESS TO AND UH HAVE A UNIVERSAL
YEAH YEAH I YOU KNOW I- I WOULDN'T EVEN MIND SO WATCH IF THEY IF THEY HAD A UM CORPORATION THAT IS FINANCED
TO THE GOVERNMENT WERE HAVE SOME SORT OF THERE CAN BE COMPETITION AS LONG AS THERE IS A UNIVERSAL PLAN I DON'T KNOW PULL I DO NOT I'M NOT FOUR ELIMINATING ALL PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE WHATSOEVER
BUT UH UM YOU KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY
FOUR THAT YOU CAN PAY BASED ON YOUR INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE
AND UH MORE FAIRLY AN ACQUITTAL E- DISTRIBUTE THE COSTS ACROSS THE WIDE SPECTRUM RIGHT NOW
YOU KNOW ALL THE PAPERWORK AND THIS COUNTRY'S HALF THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE AND WE'RE SEEING IN THAT SUN THAT A LOT OF IT'S PRIVATE SECTOR TOO
UM I YOU KNOW IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S ALWAYS ATTACKED FOUR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING PROPERLY
THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE RUN OVER THE PRIVATE SUCKERS DOING MUCH BETTER THOUGH
I GET A CREDIT THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY SET I COULD GET A CREDIT
BUT THE UM BUT IT IS IT'S GOING TO EXPIRE WHICH MEANS I'M PAYING UM I GET A S- A SOUND UH SOME OF THE MONEY BACK
BUT UH UM NOT ALL THAT OF COURSE UM
I AM IN A WORSE OFF POSITION THAN SOMEONE WHO IS EMPLOYED WHO GETS THEIR HEALTH HEALTH CARE TAKING CARE OF BY THEIR EMPLOYER
UM BECAUSE ALL I HAVE TWO ALSO OBTAIN MY INSURANCE FROM US OF THIRD PARTY MIDDLE MAN TYPE DEAL
HAVE TO GO TO THE SMALL BUSINESS SERVICE PAROLE AND PAY EIGHTY DOLLARS A YEAR JUST FOR THE RIGHT TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE
W- WELL FOR THEM BUT IT'S HORRIBLE FOR ME
YEAH I- I- I
YOU JUST CAN'T IT'S IT'S IT'S GUY RUNNING I MEAN WE'RE SEEING INCREASES EVERY YEAR OF TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT
AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND AND AND THEN YOU HAVE THESE
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
OH
YEAH I HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT ALL THAT PERSON I'M NOT GETTING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THAT RIGHT
YEAH I- I THINK MAINLY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING WHAT'S QUICKLY GOING ON UM IN THAT AT YOU KNOW
IN THAT ASPECT I AS FAR AS LIKE NOW THAN YOU HELP BUILD THAT WENT TO MINNESOTA UH UH BEING THAT IT IS THEIR NEIGHBORING STATE AND THEN I LIVED IN MINNESOTA MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE POLITICS THAT INVOLVED WITH THAT IN THAT YOU HAVE
BUT UM AS FAR AS POLITICS IN THE GRANDER UH
PART OF IT'S AS IF YOU WANNA LOOK AT UH ELECTION TYPE THINGS I'M NOT QUITE SURE E- EVEN IF I'M GOING TO BOWL UM
IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER EACH TIME AN ELECTION COMES UP LIKE THAT TO MAKE ME DECISION ON WHO WOULD BE THE BEST OF RIGHT UM
UM-HUM
SURE
EXACTLY
UM-HUM
SURE
UM-HUM SURE
IT MAY BE YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE SURE UH IT'S KIND OF WHEN YOU THINK BACK OF THE OLD POLITICS WHERE A DIRT FARMER
UH WHEN YOU THINK OF SOME OF THE BEST PRESIDENT'S WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE STRUGGLE TO GET TO THE TOP I MEAN THEY WERE NOT RICH IN ANY ANY MEANS
AND IT HAS BEEN KIND OF IN THE PAST UH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE FIFTY YEARS THAT IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO GET INVOLVED WITH POLITICS THEY'VE HAD TO HAVE MONEY
AND YOU HAD TO HAVE THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO BE PAYING YOU WAIT UM
SO IT MAKES THE COMMON PERSON AND UH THAT'S A THAT A COMMON PERSON WOULDN'T RUN FOR GOVERNMENT AND DO IT I FABULOUS JOB BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE QUITE INTELLIGENT AND
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVER SEE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE A COMMON PERSON COULD EVER GET IN THERE THAT HAS GOOD MORAL STANDINGS AND UH IT HAS
UH YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF ABRAHAM ONE THING AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THE THE BACKGROUND OF ABRAHAM LINCOLNS YOU KNOW TEACHING HIMSELF READING DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE YOU DIDN'T
YOU KNOW DO ON THE OTHER THINGS THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT WAS REAL POPULAR TO DO AND HE GETS POLITICALLY INVOLVED IN AND HAVE MONEY DIDN'T COME FROM MY UM
AND NOW I-
UM-HUM SURE
UM-HUM
SO YOU REALLY KNOW A LOT OF THE BACKGROUND
IT WAS THE DECLINE IT'S THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY W- YEAH WELL THEY'RE NOT UH YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT ALL THE CANDIDATES I WANTED TO COME PRESIDENT THEY REALLY HAVE TO HAVE THEM WHY YOU KNOW UM
IT'S THE TYPE OF JOB IN THE WORLD TO DO AND NOT ONLY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH FREEDOMS MAKE CHOICES I MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TO GO SEE THE HOUSE THE CONGRESS AND ALL OF THE OTH- OTHER THINGS TO GET A BILL PASSED
AND SURE YOU CAN YOU KNOW  YOU KNOW AT AT THE LAST AND THEN IT BUT THEN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE ALL THAT POWER ANYTHING A LONG TIME AGO PRESIDENT IS HAVE A LOT OF POWER I THINK
SO INTERESTING POLITICAL TRENDS ARE EVENTS HUH
WELL  UH ROSS PEROT
UH CAUSES INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT WITH DAVID FROST AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD YOU KNOW HEARD UM YOU KNOW HIS VIEWS EXPRESS BY HIMSELF I'D HEARD OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE BELIEVED IN
BUT THE WHOLE FUN I'M OF HIM COMING OUT OF UH LITERALLY NO WHERE NO PARTY UM AT LEAST NO APPARENT PARTY SUPPORT ON EITHER SIDE
IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING
UM-HUM
LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHERE YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL IT SEEMS THAT DECISION SO FAR HAS BEEN FILTERED BY UH YOU KNOW PARTY POLITICS SO MUCH THAT WHEN THE CANDIDATES FINALLY GET PARTY APPROVAL PARTY SUPPORTING THEIR FORGET PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC
THE THE CANDIDATES ARE READY BEYOND WHAT UH MOST PUBLIC UH FEELS IS ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR
YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE COMMON CRITICISMS OF CLINTON IS UH GEE HE'LL SAY OR DO ANYTHING IN ORDER TO GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND AND UP INTO THE POINTS OF UH PEROT BEING A SERIOUS CANDIDATE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT
THAT WAS A REQUIREMENT OF BEING A A CONTENDER WITHIN THE PARTY IS JUST TOO HAVE DONE ALL THOSE THINGS
I MEAN HERE'S THE HERE'S THE GUY WHO FOR TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN WORKING TOWARD YOU KNOW GETTING THE PARTY NOMINATION AND AND PREPARING ITSELF THE PRESIDENCY
AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WITH HE IN THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT OR YOU KNOW PRETTY SERIOUSLY THREATENED BY SOMEBODY WHO COMES OUT OF
OH WHOLE NINE POLITICAL ARENA
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH
A- AND YET EVEN HE WAS A A CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN IN THE SENSE THAT UH NOT ONLY DID HE UH STILL IN BUSINESS TWICE WITH BANKRUPTCY AND UNTIL YOU'RE BUT HE LOST SOME EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS BEFORE IT FINALLY ONE ONE
THEN THE FIRST THE FIRST AND ONLY ELECTION HE ONE WAS UM THE PRESIDENCY
UH STATE LEGISLATOR
YEAH THE ABILITY FINALLY YOU KNOW DID ONE ELECTION UH IT WAS THE PRESIDENT YEAH
YEAH
BUT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM

TIME WE ONLY GET THE PAPER ON THE WEEKENDS AND SO I'M NOT MUCH OF A
I HAVE A PAPER READER
BUT I AND I AND I'M DON'T LISTEN TO THE UM RADIO SO  I GET MOST OF MINE USE LIKE FROM DOCUMENTARIES LIKE FORTY EIGHT HOURS T- T- YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE AT NIGHT

YEAH I- I- I- I PRETTY MUCH AND THEN I WATCH THE NEWS AT LEAST TWICE A DAY
SO UM IF I MISS SOMETHING AND AND I'VE JUST RECENTLY DECIDED TO HELL WITH MY CHILDREN AND SO IT SEEMS AS IF I CATCH THE NEWS W- W- IF IT HAPPENED YOU KNOW THAT WAS
THE EXPLOSIONS AND THAT KIND OF THING MY HUSBAND'S GOT THAT I SAID THAT HAVE THAT THAT'S JUST THAT'S HO- THAT'S UH THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME SO I USUALLY FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS THEN IT THEN
I KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SINCE I'VE RECENTLY STAYED HOME
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THAT UH
NOW THAT I STAYED HOME I'M I'M USUALLY AWARE OF WENDY'S THINGS OF KURDISH HAPPENED THEN HUH
RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM

UH-HUH YEAH I KNOW IT'S JUST IN
YEAH BUT I TRIED CATS MOST OF THOSE BUT THEN YOU CAN ON WEDNESDAY SURPRISING IF I'M IF I'M I TRY
YOU KNOW I TRY AND THAT TAKES THAT SOME OUT OR THAT KIND OF THING THAT'S FINE TAKE THEM AND
I COULD SIT BACK AND WATCH IT AND IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING
UM-HUM
YE- WELL YEAH PLUS I FIND I HAVE TO VIDEOTAPE QUITE A BIT TOO YOU KNOW IF I DON'T WANT ANY INTERRUPTED YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING
UM IT SEEMS LIKE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
UNFORTUNATELY BUT AT THAT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH WELL I I GET A WEEKEND PAPERS WELL AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I GET A LOCAL WEEKLY I- I LIVED IN A SUBURB OF MILWAUKEE AND THEY GET THEY
HAVE COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS AROUND HERE SO THE LOCAL THEIR EXTREMELY LOCAL HOT STUFF UH IS IN THE LOCAL PAPER THAT COMES OUT ONCE A WEEK AND THEN I GET THE SUNDAY
UH MILWAUKEE JOURNAL BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ A PAPER UH MOSTLY THAT'S MY DIFFICULTY I CA- I GET MY NEWS PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME SOURCES YOU DO ALTHOUGH I DO LISTEN TO NPR
WHICH HAS VERY GOOD AND THAT'S NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO WHICH IS VERY GOOD UH COVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL AN INTERNATIONAL THOSE I FEEL AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ANALYSIS IS WELL USUALLY
NO I'M NOT ACTUALLY UM BUT I CAN RUN MY RADIO IN MY OFFICE I I I TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY WHEN I'M NOT
TEACHING IF I CHOOSE TO HAVE THE RADIO AND I CAN LISTEN TO THAT STATION SO
HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY AND FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN THE THINGS THAT YOU DO WATCH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
IS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE NEWS THAT YOUR MOST INTERESTED IN IS IS UH TIMELY UN- NOTING HEAVY DANCES THEY HAPPEN IS THAT WHAT YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN THE NEWS COVERAGE
UH-HUH
WELL I- I MYSELF I THE REASON WHY I LISTEN TO NPR THE REASON WHY I WATCH MCNEIL LEHRER RATHER THAN UH
THAN THE NETWORK NEWS SHOWS AT NIGHT ALTHOUGH I DO UH WATCH A LOCAL TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING NEWS WHICH YOU KNOW CARRIES OVER A LOT OF THE NATIONAL NEWS STORIES UH IS THAT
QUITE OFTEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S  THE NATIONAL DOESN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF ANALYSIS
THE LOCAL DOESN'T EITHER BUT I FEEL THAT WE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GET A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY INTO SOME SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY CURRENT
AND PERHAPS NEWSPAPERS DO THAT BUT AS I SAID I DON'T HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN REASON NEWSPAPER AND FRANKLY WHEN I HAVE A NEWSPAPER HAVEN'T NOTICED THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS EITHER
SO UM
THERE'S THERE IS SOME DANGER TO THAT OF COURSE TOO BECAUSE AT THE ANALYSIS IS INACCURATE OR BIASED OR WHATEVER THEN
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD IS IT BUT
UH I LIKE A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH COVERAGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR MAYBE APPEALING TO YOU TOO ON SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TWENTY OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS
UM-HUM
YEAH
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON THE WORLD RATHER THAN SIMPLY BEING AWARE THAT
YEAH THERE THERE'S AN INCENTIVE
I- I LIKE TO STAND THEY CAN GET THE LATELY BIGGER PICTURE MAYBE BECAUSE I'M USUALLY CONFUSED PAY DETAIL I DON'T KNOW
UH
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN RIGHT
SO THOSE EVENING SHOWS ARE PROBABLY ELSE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU'RE AT LIBERTY THAT TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND BE IN FRONT OF THE TV SET FOR A WHILE BUT INTERRUPTIONS
OH YOU DO UH-HUH
UH-HUH WHEN IS YOUR GOOD WATCHING TIME
UH-HUH YES
YEAH THAT'S IT BUT
I HAVE OLDER CHILDREN AND GETTING DINNER ON THE TABLE I COME FROM THE EAST COAST AND I WAS
IT AMAZED ME WHEN I GET OUT HERE TO THE MIDWEST AND FOUND OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE IN OUR LATER AND TIME THEY STILL WATCH THE NEWS WHEN THEY
WANNA GO FIRST
OKAY UM ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS UH
DID WE GET WHERE TO WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT A JUDGE MAKING THE DECISION AND I REALLY DON'T AGREE WITH THAT
I THINK THAT THE TRIAL BY JURY IS BETTER
UH YOU KNOW THEN THEY HAVE IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RATHER THAN TO HAVE ONE PERSON BE RESPONSIBLE
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY COULD BE OBJECTIVE IN EVERY CASE EVERY TIME
YOU KNOW I MEAN
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT THAT
WELL I I FEEL THE OTHER THING TOO UH THEY WERE SAYING UM YOU KNOW WHAT NEW WASTE COULD YOU COULD IT YOU YOU KNOW CHANGE THE SYSTEM
I- I REALLY THINK THAT UM WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME UM GOING TO APPEAL AFTER APPEAL AFTER APPEAL AFTER YOU KNOW I MEAN IF IT IF YOU GO TO A TRIAL BY JURY
AND ESPECIALLY IF A PERSON HAS COME FAST IF THEY HAVE TO THINK WHAT YOU KNOW POINT BLANK IN THE CRIME IS UH NO QUESTION IS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT
YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS I MEAN YOU KNOW WITH ONE TO THIS OLD FOR NO WE CAN'T
AND IT IT CAN GOAL UN- BEFORE I CAME T- IS I- I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS
I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE HOLD BENEFIT FROM THAT EMPLOYEE IS
I'M SERIOUS AND I THINK THAT THE LAWYERS HAVE QUITE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT EXIST IN THIS IN THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM TANK WITH PLEA BARGAINING
YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE IS YOU
WELL
WELL I KNOW THAT THAT'S THE NAME BUT I THINK A LOT OF QUALIFY WHOLE CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS IT MESSED UP
AND AND THAT MY GOD I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO'LL COMMIT UH CRIMES IF THEY I DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT WORKS EXACTLY BUT YOU KNOW THEY GET LESS OF SENTENCES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE JAILS UP ALL THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW UH
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BUT I THINK THAT THE REASON THEY HAVE FULL IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT
YOU KNOW INSANE IT W- WE DON'T HAVE UM WELL A LOT OF STATES DON'T HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
AND UM
I- I THINK THEY SHOULD I AND I THINK IF A PERSON IS GUILTY OF TAKING SOMEONE'S LIFE AND LIKE I SAY IT IT IS NO DOUBT WHAT'S ALLOWABLE LIKE DRUNK DRIVERS THAT KILLED PEOPLE AND UM
YOU KNOW ALL DAY THINK OUGHT TO GET TO RIGHTS I I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S THEY'VE THEY'VE TAKEN A LIFE IN THAT THEY SHOULD PAY FOR WITH YOU KNOW LIKE
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH REALLY
IT'S IT
YEAH
I KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT
UH-HUH
I- I DON'T KNOW UH WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU'D DO TO CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT BETTER
OH YEAH I- I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL
I IMAGINE THE GUILT THAT PERSON WOULD HAPPEN I MEAN IF THEY'RE IN DALL- IS THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT YOU COULD UM YOU KNOW FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT DAY AFTER DAY
NO WE'RE NOT REALLY
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO TRIAL IF THEY'RE QUITE FIT TO RAISE LIKE
I'M IN THE BOAT THEN I COME UP TO YOU AND I JUST POINT BLANK KILL YOU
YOU KNOW TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT WE DO YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S PREMEDITATED REALIZE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OR
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I D- I GOT TO
NO YOU CAN
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT THERE'S AND THEY'RE THE THIS TOPIC IS KIND OF MOVED UM THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY WE WE COULDN'T SURVIVE INCIDENT AND JURY SYSTEM IN A TRIAL SYSTEM WITHOUT A JURY UM
ONE MAN CAN NEVER BE ONE MAN ONE WOMAN CAN NEVER BE OBJECTIONABLE IN EVERY CASE
UM EVERY PERSON HAS THEIR OPINIONS AND THAT'S WHY A JURY SELECTION OF AUSTIN VERY DIFFICULT
UM
RIGHT
RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF DEAL
YEAH
UM-HUM
NO THAT'S RIGHT I WORK FOR A LAW FIRM I HA- I
RIGHT
WELL WE BOUGHT PLEA BARGAINING IT'S DIFFERENT STORY
PLEA BARGAINING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT THAT ACTUALLY PREVENTS TRIALS OR OR AT LEAST IT'S NOT
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
RIGHT
WE DO
RIGHT
RIGHT
NEWS SAYING IT AS FAR AS YOU KILL UM PROCEDURES CONCERNED WE JUST HAVE THE CASE AND I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF MARION BERRY
UM IS HIS LAST APPEAL WAS WAS TONIGHT TWO DAYS BEFORE AND SENTENCES UP
SO I MEAN HIS APPEAL WITHIN I DID IT BUT HE GOT OUT OF JAIL
FOR COCAINE POSSESSION BUT UM
THAT WAS ABSURD  THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REASON THE APPEAL PROCESS OF DRAGGED ON THAT LONG FOR SIX MONTHS SENTENCE
WELL
UM
THE THE ONLY THING I CAN I WAS UH YOU KNOW THE THE APPEAL PROCEDURE IS THE ONLY THING I CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF UM THAT LIKE I SAID AS FAR AS REMOVING THE THE JURY AND HAVING JUDGE SINCE THAT'S ABSURD THERE'S NO WAY THAT COULD WORK
UM
BUT
OH EXACTLY EXACTLY
RIGHT
NO WE WANT THE TOP
UM
AND
YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT EVERY CHANGE
OH YEAH I I FEEL EVERYONE EVERYONE'S UM ENTITLED TO TRIAL A JURY THAT THAT IS THAT RIGHT
WELL I MEAN WHERE THEY'RE WITNESSES
RIGHT
RIGHT THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T REMOVE JURY REGARDLESS OF THE CASE I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE FIFTY PEOPLE IT WOULD BE INTO WATCHING AS A MURDER TAKES PLACE AND YOU YOU STILL THERE STILL MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES
BEING WITH WHEN YOU WITH A BIG COMPANY HERE BIG ORGANIZATION LOT OF TIMES I YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS ARE GOOD AND AND YOU KNOW THE PACE RARE
BUT UH YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET TUNED IN TO WHAT'S GOING ON UH I TH- I THINK THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OF THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OF THE WAGES THAT THAT UH THAT THAT ANYBODY CAN GET AND AND DEALING WITH A LARGE COMPANY
IS TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU YOU GET TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY THE TOSSING THE WHOLE WORLD TO DO
WHAT WHAT'S YOUR FEELING ABOUT BENEFITS WAS SORT OF BENEFITS THAT YOU LIKE TO GET FROM PICKUP
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL I I
I- I- I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND UH ACTUALLY I WORK FOR THE FBI
AND UH AND SO WHEN YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T GET TOLD FOR GOOD REASON
BUT UH BUT BASICALLY UH THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PROJECTS I'M AN ENGINEER
YEAH I'M I'M COAT TIE AND SOMETIMES I WORKED IN THE SAME LAB WITH THE GUY AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT EACH OTHER'S PROJECTS FOR TWO YEARS AND WE SHOULD OF YOU KNOW WE WE WERE NO QUE- BRA-
AND INDI- FOR TWO YEARS WE DID AND WE WHICH WAS THAT KIND OF STUPID
BUT UH BUT UH ARE ORGANIZATIONS DOING SOMETHING ELSE SO ON MONDAY UH WERE HAVING UH FOR ALL UNCLASSIFIED PROGRAMS WHERE WE'RE HAVING ALL TABLES PUT OUT IN FRONT OF LABS AND ALWAYS
AND EVERY ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYEES YOU'RE GONNA COME AROUND AND SEE WHAT SORT OF THINGS WE DO
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING
AND
BUT UH THAT THAT'S SORT OF SORT OF THING BUT BUT IT BUT I THINK YOU CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IF YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
AND AND BUT OF COURSE MOST I'M MOST THE TIME AND THAT HAS A HARD TIME DISTURBING YOU'RE GETTING WORD OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO MUST KNOW
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T REALLY COUNT IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM YOU MIGHT NOT GET COLD FOR MONTHS OR MIGHT YOU KNOW IF IT DOESN'T IMPACT YOU DIRECTLY WORKER MANAGEMENT DOESN'T THINK THAT
BUT BUT REGARD TO BENEFITS YOU KNOW MOST COMPANIES HAVE THOSE BIG ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DECENT AND BENEFITS LIKE RETIREMENT AND THAT SORT OF THING
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR I WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR UH SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE RICH YOU KNOW THE THE MID FIFTIES W- UH IS
KEEPING A JOB UNTIL YOU RETIRE
UH ANY ENGINEERS ARE UH  OUR BAGGAGE TO MOST UH UH AS THEY GET OLDER TO TO MOST COMPANIES
AND UH IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THE MILITARY WINDOWS OUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU THINK WELL WHY GETTING MORE MONEY TO BE MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND THINGS BUT THEY SHOULD CLIMB UP THAT TREE PRETTY SOON YEAR THE THE THE BRANCHES GET SMALLER ON THE TOP OF THE TREE
AND PRETTY SOON SOMEBODY FALLS OFF UH A FALL OFF TWICE THE PRIVATE SECTOR
AND UH AND YOU KNOW I CAN GET UP
UM-HUM YEAH
UM-HUM
MAY- MAYBE RETIRED
WELL SINCE I'M KIND OF ON THE IF THE OLDEST SIDE YOU KNOW I- I- I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT BENEFITS I TALK ABOUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MEDICAL BENEFITS
UM
MY UM MY HUSBAND WAS SO MUCH DONALD DUCK WAS AND SO MUCH HIS BENEFITS AND MEDICAL BENEFITS ASSAULT EXCELLENT YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY GREAT
YOU KNOW I WORK FOR UH S- WITH A BANK QUESTION FINANCIAL
AND UH THEY DON'T LET ME KNOW REALLY ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON
EVEN SOME THEY NEED IT SEEMS THAT I NEED TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW UNTIL THE NEXT ALAN ALDA SUDDENLY NO WE GOT CHANGES MADE WITH CHANGING DEPARTMENTS WERE CHANGING POLICIES OF CHANGING DOING OTHER KINDS OF THINGS WHICH TO ME IS IS DISTURBING
MAN I FEEL LIKE IT'S I- I DON'T NECESSARILY HE NEEDED TO BE INVOLVED SINCE I'M PRETTY MUCH ON A LEVEL YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY MUCH UH LEVEL AS FAR AS UH
UH THE COMPANY IS CONCERNED BUT I- I DO KIND LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING AND I THINK I COULD BE A BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE EMPLOYEE IF IF I HAD A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ALONG THAT LINE
ALL MY CATS
UH-HUH
OH
ANY
YEAH THAT'S INTERESTING
EXACTLY

IS TO OF FIRST OF ALL PUT AND THEN TO THESE KINDS OF UH HIDDEN USER FEES AND TO
O- O- OTHER TYPES OF OF TREK'S THAT HAVE BEEN USED
TWO HELP MASKS THE SIZE OF THIS THING LET'S GET A HOLD OF WHAT THE REAL TRUE SIZE OF IT IS AND THEN LOVE TO DEAL WITH IT IMMEDIATELY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE YOU WOULD IF IT MEANS SOME SHORT TERM HIGHER TAXES
TO GET IT DOWN AND UH THEN LET'S TRY TO MAKE SOME REFORMS LI- ME CONGRESSIONAL W- COMMUNITY HA-HA
TRY AND UH MAKE IT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE
YEAH
I- I JUST KEEP SEEING UNFORTUNATELY THE P- A LOT OF THE PROBLEM WHY WE HAVE THESE DEFICIT'S BALLOON ESPECIALLY HERE IN AT SISTERS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
BOUGHT INTO THIS NOTION THAT WELL WE CAN JUST UH WE DON'T NEED A HIGHER TAXES CERTAINLY NOT THEY GET AN AWFUL OUR MONEY ALREADY AND
THE DOES IT DOESN'T SEEM TO AFFECTED ME AND MY DE- BYU FAVORITE TEAM SO SO WHAT
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU NOTICE THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE ONLY NOW STARTING TO THINK I HAD
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH THE ONLY THE ONLY PROBLEM COMES ON IS IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SCREAMING ALL ESPECIALLY VA ARE P- BECAUSE THEY WE ALL THAT WELL WE PAID FOR THIS ALL ALONG WAS IS THE HIDDEN SECRET TAX ALL TIME IT'S OUR MONEY THAT THEY DON'T WANNA GIVE BACK TO WAS NO COLORA-
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT OUT HERE IN NEW YORK TOO YOU KNOW WITH GOVERNOR MARIO CAME MARIO AND
THE LEGISLATURES OR OPPOSING PARTIES ARE CONTROLLED BY BUILDING PARTIES WHICH MEANS BASICALLY EVERY YEAR WE HAVE A SCREAMING TERRIFIED OVER THE BUDGET
IN THIS STATE WHICH IS THE LADY TORN ONLY IN THEM THEY WANNA KILL EACH OTHER AND ALL THIS
UM-HUM
WELL I HAVE TO HAVE TO SAY THAT I WOULD BE VERY IN FAVOR
ALSO
A SITUATION WHERE THE REVENUE GENERATION ACTIVITIES ALL TH- THE GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE IRS
ARE MONITORED AND
SPENDING WERE YOU'RE
EX- PLUS ONE
TEND TO GO WITH NO HIGHER THAN THE REVENUES BROUGHT IN EVERY YEAR EX-
SO THAT'S UH FORGET ABOUT THIS BALANCED BUDGET THIS WOULD IMMEDIATELY FORCE THEM
TO SAY WELL JEEZ UM IN WISTER WAS A BIG YEAR AND WE'VE ONLY GOT YOU KNOW WE TOOK IN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ODD
I REALIZE THAT THE MORE BY FAX WERE ABOUT FIVE BUT  WE WE TOOK INTO A MILLION EVEN THOUGH THIS YEAR IS GOING BETTER WE COULD STILL ONLY SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION
IT'S GONNA FACTOR KIDS
WELL UH I THINK THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN THAT
IT'S MADE UP OF A BUNCH OF SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS HAVE STARTED TO EXER- MORE POWER
UM FOR INSTANCE RETIREES THEY STARTED TO OP- SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IT USED TO BE SO SECURITY WAS JUST THE FINAL SAFETY NET
BUT IT'S NOT THAT WAY ANYMORE UH NOW YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE
UH SIXTY THOUSAND IN TAX FREE INCOME BECAUSE THEY INVESTED WISELY DURING THEIR WORKING YEARS AND THEY'RE STILL COLLECTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND ALL OF THAT MONEY IS TAX FREE
I'M SORRY I THINK THAT UM UH OLD THE INVESTMENT INCOME REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU INVEST IT SHOULD BE TAXABLE
AND THE THING IS THAT YOU GO TO LOSE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS BASED ON HOW MUCH INCOME YOU HAVE
UH YEAH I- I- I- I AGREE I THINK IT'S SO SCARY OUGHT TO BE DONE AWAY WITH AND PUT INTO THE UH NEW YORK WELL ATTACKS ATTACKS
AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS SO GO AHEAD AND PUT IN THERE AND UH
UH YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY'RE TREATING IT HAS A TAX THERE TREATING BE MONEY AS TAX REVENUE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ARE PUTTING ASIDE FROM HERE USE IT GOES INTO THE GENERAL FOREIGN WHETHER OR NOT
HE WANTS TO TO GO THERE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT GOES AND AS BEING USED SO I MEAN UM
UH MY PERSONAL OPINION OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST INSTITUTED TERM LIMITS ON THE UH UH THE SENATE AND HOUSE FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO HAVE
UH BE AFFECTED UH OF COURSE ALL THE THE UH CAREER POLLUTE GOES HERE SAY OH MY GOD YOU KNOW EVEN HAVE A BUDGET I MATURE FOR ONE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE
WELL WELL SO WHAT
UH
WELL I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE MAY END UP WITH WITH THE TERM LIMITATION GET MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT
YOU GET MORE PEOPLE SEEM TO HELP EACH WOULD WORK AND I THINK WHAT THAT WILL DO IS THAT WHAT WELL PEOPLE SAY WAIT A MINUTE
WE'VE GOT A COMPROMISE WE'VE GOT A WORK ONE SOMETHING WE NEED MORE OF A VISION AND LESS OF A GUIDE ALL GLAD MY MONEY AND AND DO EVERYTHING I CAN
UM
IN TEXAS THEY DO HAVE THE ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND UM
I- I JUST I I'M PROBABLY ONE THAT HAS TO AGREE WITH THAT TOO UM
THERE
SOME THINGS THAT GO ON THAT I JUST FEEL THAT
I- I JUST SO THAT THAT THAT THAT IS ANYTIME I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT WAY EITHER BUT I JUST FEEL THAT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCES AND
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
MAYBE THAT SOMETHING IT USED TO BE WORKED ON BUT I I JUST FEEL THAT THAT
KEPT PUSHING TO STAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM NOT ALL STATES HAVE THEM BUT I
YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS IN BUT THAT'S THE MAN THAT THEY CLAIM HE WAS ABUSED OR
AND THAT HE HAD THEM HE
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN FUN APPEALING HOME THAT
THE FIRST
YEAH RIGHT
WELL I MEAN IT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT IT REALLY DOES HAPPEN YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT USE THAT OFTEN YOU KNOW BASED HERE IN TEXAS BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING IT USED TO SAY REALLY DO
YEAH
RIGHT UH-HUH
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
MY SISTER IN OUR WONDERED ABOUT THIS RECENTLY BECAUSE IT ON OLD FRIEND OF OURS IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IT'S HAPPENED ABOUT A WEEK AGO UM HER HUSBAND JUST YOU KNOW THEY'RE UNDER WONDERING IF THAT HAS BEEN THAT
IF THAT IF SOMETHING DOES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
YEAH DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT IN THAT UH
I DON'T KNOW HUH
RIGHT
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH AND UM I HAVEN'T DONE GO THAT IS AN ATTORNEY THAT THE SAND AND PEOPLE ARE
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH PUBLICITY IT'S GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF THE STATE THAT CALIFORNIA WE JUST PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH
UM FOR A THING AS A DOUBLE MURDER UP TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION UM TO THE DETAILS OF IT UM
BUT IT HAD A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OUT HERE UH BASICALLY BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE LIKE TO PROTEST ABOUT EVERYTHING UM
BUT I AGREE I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT THEY'RE NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS THE BEST WAY TO GO UM
THE BIG DISAGREEMENT I HAVE IS THAT
YE- IN CALIFORNIA THE APPEALS PROCESS UH IS SO EXPENSIVE AND TAKES SO LONG
THAT YOU END UP SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND LIKE TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH FOR OR CRIME
AND I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S RIDICULOUS I MEAN IF YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU THE TRIAL IS SUPPOSED TO PRO- YOU KNOW WITHIN A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE PERSON IS GUILTY
AND THEN THEY HAVE APPEALS WELL THAT'S FINE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN A FEW YEARS I MEAN I SHOULD BE TWO OR THREE YEARS MAXIMUM YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW WHEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO YOU TO PUT THE GUY TO DEATH
WELL HE'S IN A SENSE I MEAN IT'S IF YOU'D GUILTY FOR FOR WERE YOU KNOW MULTIPLE MURDERS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH HE WAS LIKE UM THE THE THE DEFENSE DEFENSE THERE WERE GIVING GIVING WAS THAT UH LIKE HIS MOTHER HAD HAD BEEN AN ALCOHOLIC WHEN WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH HIM AND SO HE HE WAS AND YOU KNOW MENTALLY COMPETENT OR ANYTHING ELSE
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS AND IN THE COURT FOUND INCOMPETENT UM AND HE KNEW HE WAS DOING ANYTHING ELSE I MEAN YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS THE BEST THE FENCE THAT COME UP WITH
I FORGET I THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE YEARS OR SOMETHING
IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY OUTRAGEOUS
YEAH
I THINK IN GENERAL UH
PUNISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS A LOT WEAKER THAN IT SHOULD BE I MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM UNITED STATES IS KIND OF LIKE THE DOG POOPS ON THE CARPET AND YOU WAIT THREE MONTHS AND THEN YOU PUT IT SNOWS AND AND SPANKING FOR IT
YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO
I MEAN YOU TAKE THESE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMMITTING VIOLENT CRIMES MOST UP NOT ALL BY ANY MEANS BUT YOU KNOW LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING VERY MUCH DAY TO DAY IN THE FIRST PLACE
UM THEY DON'T REALLY SEE PAST NEXT WEEK MUCH LESS NEXT YEAR AND IT'S A YOU KNOW WELL FI- KILL SOMEBODY TONIGHT DECADE FROM NOW I MIGHT FACE THE PUNISHMENT
THAT'S NOT REAL IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL IMPACT ON THEM
UM-HUM
UM YOU MEAN WE'D HE'D BE PUT TO DEATH FOR THAT
UM  LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GENERALLY
YOU KNOW WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S IT'S ONLY THE MOST UH BRUTAL TYPES OF THINGS USUALLY WORKS MULTIPLE YOU KNOW
IF YOU IF THEY CAN SAY THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WELL HE WAS JUST YOU KNOW TEMPORARILY INSANE BECAUSE OF SOME DOMESTIC SQUABBLE BUTTONS
YOU KNOW THEY'LL THEY'LL GIVE THEM YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS WITH WITH PAROLING IN TWELVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH-HUH
AND IN WHAT WAY UP AND UH
RIGHT
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH I YEAH I'M ALSO THOUGHT THAT UM THAT WOULD AND IF YOU'RE WITH WITH COLLEGE WORK
YEAH THEY DID
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
WHEN DID THEY ASKED IN THIS IS GONNA BE PROPOSED OR MANDATORY OH WHEN WHEN I WENT TO WHAT YEAR THEY LOOKING AT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM YEAH
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR LINE
UH WHAT AGE GROUP I- I- I THEY LOOKING AT UM
EIGHTEEN YEAH THAT SEEMS ANOMALY THAT WOULD AN AFFAIR WITH COLLEGE I WOULD THINK
I MOVED MAYBE THAT IS THAT PART OF IT
OH
OH HUH
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL THAT'S KIND OF SCARY  I WA- OVER IT BUT I DO HAVE CHILDREN TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW
THAT'S FUN YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
UH-HUH UH-HUH UM-HUM
YOU YOU TALK ABOUT THEM A LOT OF WAY YEAH HE'S HE'S FROM DALLAS OR HE'S IN THE DALLAS AREA AND UH HE'S VERY WELL NONE AROUND HERE SO
UH-HUH
YEAH I I
YEAH YEAH I- I THINK HE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE NOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU'RE PULLING FOR HIM
NO
OH  WELL THE THING HOW DID YOU E- E- YOU WORK ANY UM COMPUTER BUSINESS THAT SHE SAID
UH AND UH MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR IT AND TEXAS INSTRUMENTS AND SO UM THAT'S HOW WE KIND OF GOT THE SWITCHBOARD
SEE UH MANDATORY SERVICE YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
UH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TOUGH TO UH ALL I ALL I INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE UH IN SERVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE COULD DO THAT AND SUCH A WAY THAT WE COULD AVOID WHINING UP ASLEEP STATE
IT'S I LIKE THE IDEA
WELL  WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T DO IT
BUT TO USE FORCE UM REALLY SETS IS A IT IT IT'S ACTUALLY SAYS THAT YOUR BODY UH THERE'S A TITLE TO YOUR BODY AND THAT TITLE BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND YOU WERE NOT A FREE AMERICAN CITIZEN
THE IDEA IT'S ALSO SERVICE IS GOOD
AND WHEN SOMEONE IS SAY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT SURE ABOUT COLLEGE OR OUT OF COLLEGE AND NOT READY TO GO INTO A CAREER AND THEY'RE NOT COMMITTED A HUGE AMOUNTS OF THAT THAT'S THE BEST TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO WORK IT DOESN'T PAY VERY WELL
YEAH UNLESS A RETI- DIRECTLY
YOU KNOW SOMEONE WE'RE STUDYING SOMETHING I SAVE TAKE SOMETHING OUT SKEWER SOMEBODY RE- STUDYING ECONOMICS THE STATE DEPARTMENT COULD OFFER TO SEND THEM TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR TWO YEARS TO TEACH THEM OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY
UM-HUM AS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE RIGHT
BUT IN REALITY I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD WIND UP WITH IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL WHERE THEY WOULD SEE ALL THESE BODY COUNTS THAT THEY CAN USE TO FOR THEIR OWN WILL AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK
WELL THEY'RE NOT THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THEN IT'S SORT OF A TOPIC OF DEBATE EVERY TIME IT COMES UP IT GETS VOTED DOWN THE UH PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-MILITARY OPPOSE IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE MILITARY INTO SOMETHING ELSE
AND THE PEOPLE ARE PRO-CONSTITUTION OPPOSE IT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO A FORCE YOU TO DRAW IN THE MILITARY UNLESS THE UNITED STATES IS ACTUALLY UNDER ATTACK
SO SO MOSTLY IT'S JUST GOT <UNK> GOES AWAY  FA- THEY'VE GOT <UNK> FELINE <UNK> FIXED
YEAH SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN CENTS
F- I ALWAYS SEEM TO DRAFT AGE FIAT FACILITIES SUNNY SEE IF I CAN GET ON A CLEAR LINE F- IT'S IT'S MY LINE OF
YEAH I DID MY LINE I WAS ON THE RADIO FROM
ALL RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YEAH I KNOW THEY'RE THEY THEY FIGURE THAT THEY CAN DRIVE TO EIGHTEEN THEY USUALLY DO DRIVE TO A NINETEEN AND THAT'S THE AGE THAT LOOK UH
AND OF COURSE THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THEY WOMEN WOULD BE EQUALLY GRABBED AND THEY'RE ALMOST ON THE VERGE OF SAYING THAT YOU YOU CAN ADDRESS MENU GONNA HAVE TO DRAFT WOMEN IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT THEM IN FRONT OF THE GUNS JUST THE SAME
SO UH IF YOU'RE NEAR THAT AGE WHERE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UH YOU KNOW BE WHERE ABOUT
YEAH
OH OKAY
YEAH I ENJOY THEM SENT OFF OF THE MIDDLE EAST HELP DEFEND BUSH FROM SET THEM AFTER BUSH GETS DONE ARMING THEM
YEAH WE ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THAT A YEAR AFTER THE FACT
SO IT'S AND I THINK WHEN ENDOWED DON'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT AT ALL  REALLY REACHED THAT POINT
HERE IN PEROT COUNTRY I AM REALLY THINKING THAT THIS GUY MIGHT BE GOOD FOR US
I'VE BEEN USING DANGERS THAT THAT IS THE GUY CLOSET BY SYSTEM AND I FIND OUT THEY HELP WITH THE UNITED STATES TO THE GANG WARS
YEAH
YEAH I'M IN THE COMPUTER BUSINESS IS SO AND I MEAN WELL KNOWN INDUSTRY THEY UH UH HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE IN INTERESTED AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT IS EXCELLENT FOR US BUT I'M FARM
I MEAN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARILY GONNA VOTE FOR BROWNS BECAUSE LIKE I LIKE BROWN AND HIS ATTITUDE BUT WHEN THE WHEN IT REALLY COMES DOWN IN THE FALL I THINK I KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO
UM-HUM
