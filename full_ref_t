UH TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR OR WHATEVER BUT IT WOULD CUT BACK TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TO THE SCHOOLS AND I HAPPENED TO KNOW A GOOD TEACHER HERE IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SHE WAS REALLY AGAINST IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST TAKE AWAY ALL ALL THEIR MONEY(sw02013-B_004321-005407)

THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN SEE IT'S GONNA BE RESOLVED IS THERE ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE IN THE RICH DISTRICT THAT ARE GONNA FIGHT THAT AND AND IT'S GONNA BE A REAL BAD MESS BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE ON EVERY SIDE OF THE PROBLEM(sw02013-B_016944-017960)

THAT IF A GUY IS CONVICTED OR A GAL IS CONVICTED OF A CRIME(sw02051-B_011284-011729)

THE TAX BASIS IS ACTUALLY UH LESS THAN THE FULL PRICE OF THE HOUSE(sw02327-B_009073-009742)
SO YOU END UP PAYING PROPERTY TAXES ON WHAT THEY VALUE THE HOUSE AT I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE THE HOUSE VALUED AT PROBABLY ABOUT(sw02327-B_009742-010314)
NINETY OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS(sw02327-B_010314-010594)

AND SO THERE WAS QUITE A DIFFERENCE THERE(sw02327-B_011341-011566)
UM I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY THEY LEVY TAXES IS A LITTLE BIT UH(sw02327-B_011566-012278)
CRAZY I THINK IF IF THEY UH PEOPLE AND AND I'LL USE PLANO AS AN EXAMPLE UH HOUSE PRICES IN PLANO WERE FALLING(sw02327-B_012278-013198)
AND SO THEY DECIDED WELL IN ORDER TO GET MORE TAX REVENUE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE UH YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE THE UH THE THE UH TAX PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF VALUE ON THE HOUSE(sw02327-B_013198-014467)
AND SAME TIME THEY WERE APPROVING NEW STARTS IN HOMES HAND OVER FIST WELL WHEN YOU START HAVING A LARGE SUPPLY OF HOMES(sw02327-B_014467-015243)
THEN OF COURSE THE PRICE GOES YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE IS GOING TO FALL AND THE EXISTING FAMILY HOMES WERE THE ONES THAT WERE FALLING THE NEW HOMES THEY WERE BUILDING CHEAPER AND AND ABLE TO SELL CHEAPER AND SO PEOPLE WEREN'T BUYING THE EXISTING FAMILY HOMES SO(sw02327-B_015243-016659)
THEY WERE SHOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT(sw02327-B_016659-016855)
AND YOU KNOW IF THEY JUST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WELL GEE IF WE DON'T YOU KNOW IF WE PUT A FREEZE ON NEW HOME STARTS(sw02327-B_016855-017511)
THAT WILL BRING THE PRICE OF HOUSES BACK UP OUR TAX BASE REVENUE WILL GO UP AND WE WON'T HAVE TO INCREASE TAXES AND MAKE IT MORE OF A BURDEN ON PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING HERE(sw02327-B_017511-018624)

I'VE HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS UH PRO AND CON ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD ALLOW DEDUCTIONS FOR SALES TAX OR EVEN UH(sw02327-B_026521-027350)
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON SALES TAX BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE PEOPLE THAT PURCHASE MORE ITEMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO PAY THE TAXES(sw02327-B_027350-028447)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE BARELY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UH HOUSE PAYMENT AND BUY FOOD AREN'T GOING TO BE OUT BUYING YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE(sw02327-B_028447-029176)

OKAY DO I STILL CAN- STILL CAN FEEL THAT THE SOVIET UNION AS SUCH IS STILL A THREAT TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD ABSOLUTELY(sw02602-B_000209-001053)
AND MY REASONS ARE BASED UPON NOT ONLY FROM WHAT I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT I SEE ON THE NEWSPAPERS BUT UP AGAINST SOME OF THE(sw02602-B_001256-002078)
FUN AND EXCITING THINGS I RAN INTO DURING MY SIX YEARS AS A SOLDIER IN THE FIFTH SPECIAL FORCES GROUP(sw02602-B_002078-002713)
WELL THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT A POWDER KEG(sw02602-B_003774-004044)
THE UM(sw02602-B_004044-004225)
I'LL GO BACK IN TIME A LITTLE BIT TO ABOUT EIGHTY ONE(sw02602-B_004383-004753)
WHEN MY FIRST REAL INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MILITARY STARTED(sw02602-B_004753-005128)
UM(sw02602-B_005128-005274)
NATURALLY WE WERE AT THE TIME THE SOVIET UNION WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BIG MILITARY POWER AND THE BIG THREAT SO WE GOT LOTS QUITE A BIT OF(sw02602-B_005628-006480)
INFORMATION AS WELL AS INDOCTRINATION ON SOVIET TACTICS AND WEAPONS(sw02602-B_006480-006933)
I WENT TO LEBANON IN EIGHTY THREE BEFORE THE MARINES EVER GOT THERE WITH THE UN PEACE KEEPING FORCE(sw02602-B_007038-007605)
AND WITH THE TRAINING I RECEIVED PRIOR TO GOING THERE WITH CAPTURED WEAPONS WE KEPT RUNNING UP AGAINST(sw02602-B_007878-008492)
THESE WEREN'T THESE WEREN'T CHINESE MADE COPIES THESE WERE SOVIET MADE TOP OF THE LINE FRESH OUT OF THE BOX AK-47S(sw02602-B_008492-009245)
AS WELL AS A LOT OF THE EXPLOSIVES WE WERE RUNNING INTO(sw02602-B_009245-009592)
IN GRANADA IN OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTY THREE WE INVADED THE PLACE(sw02602-B_009753-010223)
SURE THERE WERE CUBAN SOLDIERS THERE BUT THERE WAS ALSO A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN ADVISORS THAT WERE DAMN GOOD SHOTS(sw02602-B_010223-010762)
THE TEAM I WAS WITH WE JUMPED IN ON THE WESTERN TIP OF OF THE ISLAND DOWN ON POINT SALINAS(sw02602-B_010877-011407)
AND FOR EVERY CUBAN THERE WAS AT LEAST FIVE RUSSIAN ADVISORS(sw02602-B_011564-012023)
AND THEY WERE ALL SHOOTING STATE OF THE ART SOVIET WEAPONS(sw02602-B_012023-012469)
IN EIGHTY FOUR(sw02602-B_012648-012832)
I WAS DOWN IN CENTRAL AMERICA AS AN ADVISOR TO THE HONDURAN ARMY(sw02602-B_012832-013253)
AGAIN WE WERE RUNNING UP AGAINST CUBANS QUITE A BIT PLUS SOVIET ADVISORS(sw02602-B_013253-013806)
AND THE EQUIPMENT WE WERE CAPTURING AND TAKING FROM THE NICARAGUANS WAS BRAND NEW OUT OF THE CRATE SOVIET MADE MATERIAL(sw02602-B_013806-014577)
DO I CONSIDER THEM A THREAT ABSOLUTELY(sw02602-B_014577-014877)
THEY HAVE A UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW CALLED THE PATRICE DE LAMUMBA UNIVERSITY(sw02602-B_014877-015313)
ABOUT LIKE A AND M OR UT WHERE THEY'RE TEACHINGS SUBJECTS LIKE THAT THEY'RE TEACHING TERRORISM(sw02602-B_015413-015878)
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE WENT UP AGAINST IN LEBANON WERE GRADUATES FROM THAT PLACE AND LET ME TELL YOU THEY ARE NOTHING NICE TO GO UP AGAINST(sw02602-B_015985-016646)
I'M SURPRISED DURING THIS IRAQI CRISIS WE DIDN'T HAVE MORE(sw02602-B_016646-017062)
INCIDENTS THAN THEY DID(sw02602-B_017062-017338)
THESE GUYS ARE TOP OF THE LINE(sw02602-B_017338-017628)
WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THERE(sw02602-B_017628-017893)
THEY CAN PULL TERRORIST ACTIONS ANYWHERE IN THE FREE WORLD(sw02602-B_017893-018300)
AND THEY ARE VERY VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO(sw02602-B_018486-018751)
SO UNTIL I SEE THE ENTIRE(sw02602-B_019070-019378)
QUOTE OLD GUARD(sw02602-B_019378-019660)
OF THE SOVIET MILITARY OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT(sw02602-B_019660-020191)
COMPLETELY ROLL OVER AND DISAPPEAR PREFERABLY BURIED(sw02602-B_020292-020737)
I STILL CONSIDER THEM A THREAT(sw02602-B_020737-020976)
THEIR MILITARY IS DIFFERENT FROM OURS TO WHERE THERE ARE EXTREMIST GEN- GENERALS THAT ACTUALLY CONTROL TENS AND THOUSANDS(sw02602-B_021146-021830)
OF TROOPS(sw02602-B_021830-021996)
THAT IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT SOVIET POLICY IS THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THE GENERAL TELLS THEM(sw02602-B_021996-022467)
WELL IT'S IN- INTERESTING WATCHING THE DIFFERENT SOVIET STATES ALBANIA LITHUANIA(sw02602-B_023623-024293)
DOING THEIR LITTLE REVOLTS DOWN THERE(sw02602-B_024293-024638)
EACH ONE OF THOSE SECTORS HAS GOT A SOVIET GENERAL OVER THE TROOPS THAT ARE THERE(sw02602-B_024638-025080)
SO FAR THEY HADN'T RUN INTO THE REAL PSYCHOS YET(sw02602-B_025080-025448)
THERE'S PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX WHICH WOULD BE AN EQUIVALENT OF OUR JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFFS THAT ARE IN POSITIONS OVER SOME OF THESE SOVIET STATES(sw02602-B_025448-026299)
IF UPRISINGS HA- HAPPEN IN THEIR SECTORS(sw02602-B_026299-026639)
IT IS IT'S GOING TO BE A TOTAL BLOOD BATH(sw02602-B_026749-027041)
ACTUALLY THEY'RE SHOWING REMARKABLE RESTRAINT(sw02602-B_027453-027796)
THEY GET REAL NASTY THE HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS COME OUT AND THEY(sw02602-B_027985-028407)
WOULD LEVEL ENTIRE AREAS(sw02602-B_028407-028665)
OKAY YOU'RE FROM THE DALLAS AREA RIGHT(sw02602-B_028796-029055)
OKAY YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE SIZE OF UH THE AREA AROUND RICHARDSON(sw02602-B_029055-029572)
YOU PUT FIVE SOVIET HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR THEY CAN LEVEL THE ENTIRE AREA AND THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT ALIVE(sw02602-B_029672-030320)
AND THEY CAN DO THAT IN ABOUT FOUR MINUTES(sw02602-B_030320-030615)
AND THEY'VE GOT ENTIRE SQUADRONS OF THOSE JUST STANDING BY(sw02602-B_030746-031085)
THEY USED THEM IN AFGHANISTAN DID RE- REMARKABLY WELL CONSIDERING THE TERRAIN THEY WERE FLYING IN(sw02602-B_031351-031960)
BUT ON A HIGHLY POPULATED AREA LIKE SOME OF THE SOVIET CITIES WOULD BE(sw02602-B_032361-032845)
WITH THE WEAPONRY THAT'S ATTACHED ON THOSE THINGS THERE IS NO PLACE TO HIDE(sw02602-B_033231-033725)
IF THE BOMBS DON'T GET YOU IF THE BULLETS DON'T GET YOU THEN THE THEN THE NERVE GAS DEFINITELY WILL GET YOU(sw02602-B_033725-034362)
THE ONLY DRAWBACK ON THAT LITTLE PIECE OF MACHINERY IS THEY ONLY GOT FIVE MINUTES OF AIR TIME(sw02602-B_034647-035116)
THEY DRINK THAT MUCH FUEL(sw02602-B_035229-035434)
WERE YOU HAVE YOU I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ANY TIME IN THE MILITARY(sw02602-B_036063-036477)
AS A CIVILIAN THAT'S NEVER BEEN ATTACHED TO ANY FORM OF THE MILITARY(sw02602-B_036584-037157)
I KNOW A LOT OF THIS STUFF THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN NEVER DID MAKE THE NEWSPAPERS BUT(sw02602-B_037262-037883)
DURING THAT SAME TIME FRAME DIDN'T YOU GET SOME FEELING THAT I MEAN THEY'RE GETTING ALL THESE WEAPONS AND STUFF(sw02602-B_038004-038507)
DIDN'T IT(sw02602-B_038507-038618)
IT BUG YOU A LITTLE BIT WHY THEY KEPT COMING UP WITH ALL THIS STUFF(sw02602-B_038618-038993)
IN ANY OF THEM SINCE EIGHTY ONE(sw02602-B_039641-039899)
IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO WHETHER IT'S OUR SIDE THEIR SIDE IT'S A MATTER OF MONEY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT(sw02602-B_042131-042775)
THE DEAL THE IRAQI'S HAVE WITH THE RUSSIANS WAS FOR OIL(sw02602-B_042775-043111)
UH THE ONES TO THE SOUTH ARE MORE REGIONAL CONFLICT(sw02602-B_044117-044535)
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THAT WORRIED ABOUT(sw02602-B_044535-044948)
INVADING NORTH(sw02602-B_044948-045236)
THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN THEY'VE GOT A SCREWED UP SITUATION I'LL GIVE THEM THAT(sw02602-B_045236-045730)
FROM MEXICO ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO CEN- CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA THE SITUATION DOWN THERE IS WEIRD AND IT'S VERY SCREWED UP(sw02602-B_045890-046595)
INFLATION IS OUT OF THIS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENTS WHICH(sw02602-B_046595-047073)
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TECHNICALLY SUPPORTED FOR YEARS ARE CORRUPT AS ALL GET OUT(sw02602-B_047073-047707)
AND GENERALLY THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCREWED AND THEY'RE TIRED OF IT AND THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER IT EVEN IF THAT MEANS GOING TO COMMUNISM(sw02602-B_047707-048400)
UNFORTUNATELY YELTSIN'S GOT TOO MANY CONNECTIONS WITH THE OLD GUARD(sw02602-B_049968-050374)
THAT'S THE ONLY DRAWBACK THAT I SEE WITH THE ENTIRE THING GORBACHEV HAS MADE HIS ATTEMPT AND HE'S HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THE OLD GUARD HIMSELF(sw02602-B_050677-051621)
YELTSIN'S IN TIGHT WITH THE OLD GUARD(sw02602-B_051621-051906)
SO IT MAY BE TRYING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS AT THIS POINT(sw02602-B_052195-052612)
YOU MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY PULLED THE TROOPS OUT OF UH(sw02602-B_053966-054357)
OR THEY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IN EUROPE AFTER THE BERLIN WALL WENT DOWN I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT(sw02602-B_054357-054929)
BUT BY NO MEANS DO I(sw02602-B_055155-055389)
ENDORSE OR APPROVE PULLING EVERYBODY OUT(sw02602-B_055389-055712)

A MUCH REDUCED FORCE THAN WHAT WE USED TO HAVE OVER THERE(sw02602-B_056083-056455)

AND WHAT ALL WE WENT THROUGH THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE IRAQI SITUATION IT SEEMS LIKE UH WE HAVE UH MADE UH UH UH A A RATHER(sw02732-B_029844-030688)

MORE SMART THINGS THAT ARE VERY DAMAGING GETTING IN GETTING OUT UH MAKING END RUNS ALLOWING MORE CREATIVITY AT THE LOWER ECHELON LEVELS FOR PEOPLE TO SLIP IN SLIP OUT AND DO THINGS(sw02732-B_036154-037222)

UH WE WE CONGRESS GOT TOO MUCH INVOLVED IN IN TRYING TO MANAGE THE WAR(sw02732-B_038193-038711)
YEAH AND THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG WAY TO TO GO TO CONDUCT A WAR IN MY OPINION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN A WAR RIGHT OR WRONG YOU SHOULD LET THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT HANDLE IT AND AND AND GIVE THEM THE JOB THAT THEY'RE PAID AND SUPPOSEDLY SKILLED AT DOING(sw02732-B_038853-040200)
AND LET THEM GET ON WITH IT INSTEAD OF TYING THEIR HANDS WHICH I FELT LIKE WAS NOT THE CASE IN THE VIETNAM WAR BUT WAS ENTIRELY THE OPPOSITE IN THE CASE OF THE IRAQI WAR(sw02732-B_040200-040949)
WHERE THEY MORE OR LESS GAVE IT TO SCHWARTZKOPF AND AND THE REST OF THE MILITARY UNITS AND JUST SAYS HEY LOOK HANDLE IT AND THEY DID(sw02732-B_040949-041623)

AND THAT THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTRY BREAKS DOWN AND THERE'S STRIFE AND MUCH MUCH DEATH(sw02809-A_008632-009078)

AND I'D SAY SEEMS TO ME UH THAT THE MISSILES ARE THE THREAT(sw02809-A_030095-030522)

THE UH I GUESS THE MAIN ISSUE IS IS THAT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS BREAKING UP INTO IT'S OWN INTERNAL PROBLEMS(sw02809-B_003799-004560)
UM AND IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE NICE IF THE VARIOUS UM REPUBLICS SECEDED(sw02809-B_004560-005262)
ON THE OTHER HAND I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF THE VARIOUS STATES IN OUR UNION SECEDED UH BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT UH(sw02809-B_005262-006060)
AND IT'S MUCH LESS THAN CLEAR TO ME THAT AS A MILITARY POWER UM THERE'S GOING TO BE ANYTHING LEFT UH GIVEN THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS(sw02809-B_006060-006987)

UM(sw02809-B_012369-012526)
THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE(sw02809-B_013000-013212)
UH BUT CERTAINLY THE LATEST RUMORS IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS LET'S SOAK THE RICH SOME MORE SO WE CAN SPREAD OUT THE MONEY(sw02809-B_013212-013905)

UH(sw02809-B_014164-014270)
SO UM YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR IT TO HAPPEN(sw02809-B_014270-014672)
UM(sw02809-B_014672-014803)
AND THEY SO SO I GUESS SINCE THE PRIMARY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A MILITARY PROBLEM THAT'S LESS THAN CLEAR TO ME I MEAN IF THEY'RE SMART THEY'RE JUST GOING TO LET US HEAD TOWARD COMMUNISM ON OUR OWN VERY MERRY WAY(sw02809-B_014803-015880)
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT SORT OF THING BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'D GET MORE OUT OF IT THAT WAY(sw02809-B_015880-016595)
UM(sw02809-B_016595-016807)

I JUST I CAN'T SEE THEM MAINTAINING THE MISSILE BASES IN FACT I THINK IF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT STARTS RETREATING YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THESE CIVIL WARS AND STUFF THE FIRST THING THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS CLOSE DOWN THE MISSILE BASES IN THE REPUBLICS(sw02809-B_032345-033400)

MIGHT BE USED AGAINST THEM THAT'S RIGHT(sw02809-B_033805-034099)

AND HER THE REST OF HER FAMILY AND HER REGULAR DOCTORS AND EVERYBODY SHE TRUSTED AND KNEW WAS IN DAYTON AND WERE SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES AWAY(sw03187-A_011056-011936)
SO I MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME AND MY SISTER BEING ON THE OTHER END FOUND ONE(sw03187-A_011936-012622)
THAT SHE COULD HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED AN INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITY SHE HAD HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AND DIDN'T HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH ANYONE AND COULD BRING IN HER OWN CHAIR AND TV SET SO(sw03187-A_012622-013646)
YES AND THAT THE OTHER MAJOR FACTOR IS THAT SHE NEEDS BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS EVERY WEEK TO TEN DAYS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED A DAY OR TWO SO IN THIS FACILITY THEY CAN DO IT RIGHT THERE FROM HER OWN ROOM(sw03187-A_013646-014934)

ALL RIGHT THIS IS MY OPINION I I'M STILL A STUDENT RIGHT NOW AND I'M ACTUALLY STUDYING IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION I THINK THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS TODAY(sw03498-A_000002-000964)
UM MORE THAN ANYTHING I JUST BELIEVE THAT AS STUDENTS WE'RE TAUGHT TO LEARN WHAT THE TEACHER WANTS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY UM GAINING A FURTHER VANTAGE POINT(sw03498-A_000964-001810)
AND SO IT'S BASICALLY WE'RE TAUGHT TO BE MEDIOCRE IN WHAT WE LEARN(sw03498-A_001810-002279)

UM-HUM(sw03498-A_010138-010293)

AND I I FOUND  IN MY OWN SCHOOLING THAT WHEN THE TEACHERS MADE THAT SPECIAL EFFORT TO TO MAKE THE CLASS EXCITING TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT TO TO CHALLENGE MY INTELLECT OR TO TO BRING ABOUT A DIFFERENT METHOD OF TEACHING I WAS A LOT MORE INTERESTED IN LEARNING(sw03498-A_017784-019242)

I'D SAY FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO SPENDING MORE TIME ON THE BASIC READING WRITING ARITHMETIC(sw03551-A_003208-003929)
AND GRADE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY REALLY TEACH ABOUT FORTY PERCENT LESS THAN THEY USED TO AND IT SHOWS UP(sw03551-A_003929-004573)

AND UH ONE THING THEY DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME(sw03551-A_007621-008004)
JUST TEACHING READING AND WRITING SO A LOT OF KIDS ARE JUST BEING PROMOTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THEY TRULY CAN'T READ(sw03551-A_008004-008608)

HISTORY WHEN THEY CAN'T READ ANYTHING YOU KNOW OR EVEN READ A WORD PROBLEM IN MATH(sw03551-A_008857-009361)
SO UM THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM ANOTHER PROBLEM IS YOU'RE NOT GONNA KEEP THE SMARTER PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM TOO LONG PAYING THE WAGES THEY DO(sw03551-A_009361-010334)
BUT UM(sw03551-A_010334-010523)
WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE THEY'RE ALL SO DIFFERENT THAT'S ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES THERE'S NO NATIONAL CURRICULUM YOU KNOW(sw03551-A_011038-011766)
I MEAN WHAT THEY'D BE TEACHING IN AN ARLINGTON SCHOOL THEY MIGHT NOT BE TEACHING IN A PLANO SCHOOL AND AND THE VERY SAME(sw03551-A_011766-012596)
SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU MAY EVEN IN AN ARLINGTON SEVENTH GRADE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE(sw03551-A_012596-013128)

SO THAT'S KIND OF O- YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ODD TO ME(sw03551-A_013939-014304)
IT DEPENDS ON UM(sw03551-A_014304-014521)

UH LIKE A THIRD GRADE TEACHER WILL GET KIDS FROM SECOND GRADE THAT DIDN'T EVEN LEARN WHAT UH THEY SHOULD TO DO THE WORK THAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO TEACH YOU KNOW(sw03551-A_019365-020370)
OH THE AND UH ACCORDING TO HER PLAN SO I GUESS IF THERE WAS A NATIONAL CURRICULUM WE'D AT LEAST  HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT ALL KIDS WOULD LEARN(sw03551-A_020370-021381)
BUT UH WE ACTUALLY RANK FORTY NINTH IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS JUST PLAIN LITERACY GOES YOU KNOW(sw03551-A_021381-022172)

WELL YOU KNOW IN IN CIVIL CASES THEY CAN HAVE UH AS FEW AS TEN OF THE JURORS AGREE ON A VERDICT BUT CRIMINAL NORMALLY REQUIRES UNANIMOUS(sw03592-A_011985-012911)

AND I THINK IT STARTS WHEN THE KIDS ARE LITTLE I THINK THE PARENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT(sw03957-B_001293-002377)
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A LOT OF PARENTS ESPECIALLY WHERE I'M AT I HAVE A LOT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT EVER IS DONE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER MOTHERS AT HOME(sw03957-B_002377-003500)

AND HAVE THE TIME THAT THEY SPENT IN THEIR JURY DISTRICT COUNT TOWARDS SOME OF THEIR GRADUATION HOURS(sw03957-B_027464-028151)

CITY FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS HAS CERTAIN THEY  HAD A TRIAL SECTION THAT WAS HAVING CURB SIDE RECYCLING WITH SPECIAL CONTAINERS(sw04075-B_002921-003941)
AND THEN THEY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND PHASE IT IN PIECE BY PIECE SO EVERY YEAR A DIFFERENT PIECE OF THE CITY GETS ADDED TO THE LIST(sw04075-B_003941-004898)

UH-HUH HOW ABOUT ALUMINUM CANS DO THEY RECYCLE THAT(sw04075-B_012937-013336)
RIGHT WELL THE ONLY PART THE THING IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY ISN'T PROFITABLE TO JUST FROM UM A STANDPOINT OF MAKING NEW PAPER TO RECYCLE(sw04075-B_014690-015569)
BUT WHERE YOU END UP HAVING A SAVINGS IS AT YOUR LANDFILL LAST SO MUCH LONGER(sw04075-B_015569-016097)

LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THEY HAVE HAD SOME LANDFILL FILLING UP PROBLEMS AND THEY COUNTY BUILT A NEW LANDFILL AND A SITE THAT WASN'T GEOLOGICALLY PROPER(sw04075-B_016699-017767)

ANOTHER THINGS THAT THEY ARE DOING NOT AT HOME BUT IN THE OFFICES HERE IS RECYCLING OF PAPER AND(sw04075-B_019080-020065)

MANDATORY WASTE RECYCLING FEE AND MY DADDY W- WOULD LIKE TO TO GET THE USED OIL TO POUR OVER FENCE POSTS(sw04075-B_025444-026454)

THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GIVE YOU THE OIL THEY SAY IT'S AGAINST THE FEDERAL LAW NOW(sw04075-B_027439-027909)
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO CHARGE THE WASTE RECYCLING FEE(sw04075-B_027909-028434)

AND I- I(sw04372-A_018733-018902)
I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES PURCHASING SOMETHING MAIL ORDER AND THEN HAVING HAVING TO PAY SALES TAX ON IT(sw04372-A_018902-019512)
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY UM THE WAY IT WORKS USUALLY THE THE PERSON ORDERING IT DOESN'T PAY BUT THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT WILL UH SUCK UP ALL THE BILLS AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY(sw04372-A_019625-020482)
AND THERE R- THERE ARE S- SOME SUBSTANTIAL NASTY PENALTIES UM IF YOU IF BUSINESSES TRY TO AVOID THAT(sw04372-A_020482-021058)
A AS IF(sw04372-A_021538-021760)
NO BUSINESSES UM IF(sw04372-A_021760-022056)

I- I MIGHT BUY THE MOTHERBOARDS FROM UTAH BUT THEN STILL HAVE TO PAY SOME PENNSYLVANIA SALES TAX MY A- ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT WILL AT THE END OF THE MONTH(sw04372-A_023043-023746)
UH I THINK THAT  I THINK THAT'S THE WAY THINGS WORK IN PENNSYLVANIA AND I KNOW THEY WORK THAT WAY IN UH SAY HERE IN DC(sw04372-A_023864-024448)
YEAH(sw04372-A_024866-025001)
THAT'S TRUE I- I- A R- A BIG HOLE DOES EXIST RIGHT NOW UH IN THAT CONSUMERS CAN JUST SAY OH I- I FORGOT THAT THERE THERE IS NO WELL DEFINED MECHANISM AT ALL AND AND THAT IT IS A  A A LOSS I- I THINK(sw04372-A_027297-028672)
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UH WONDERFUL ABUSES IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES WHEREBY YOU CAN PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER(sw04372-B_000000-000874)
AND AFTER THE FACT THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA CAN FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND SEND YOU A BILL FOR THE SALES TAX APPROPRIATE TO THAT ITEM THAT YOU PURCHASED AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES FROM THE TIME THAT YOU BOUGHT IT(sw04372-B_000874-001953)
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS PENNSYLVANIA KIND OF OUT OF LINE THERE(sw04372-B_001953-002285)
WHAT WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW THOUGH I MEAN WHAT IF YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT YOU'RE SUBJECT TO PAYING UM INCOME TAX ON SOMETHING THAT YOU PURCHASE MAIL ORDER(sw04372-B_003669-004726)
WELL I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT(sw04372-B_007736-007979)
GENERALLY AT LEAST IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER IT'S NOT TO CIRCUMVENT PAYING SALES TAX TO THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IT'S BECAUSE(sw04372-B_007979-008829)
I'M SORRY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA UH IT'S BECAUSE I- I CAN'T FIND THE ITEM THAT I WANT AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE ANYWHERE IN MY LOCAL AREA SO I GO OUTSIDE THE AREA FOR THAT(sw04372-B_008829-010001)
AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO POLICE MYSELF AND PAY PENNSYLVANIA WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE OWED(sw04372-B_010001-010727)
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE REVENUE STREAM WENT TO ANOTHER STATE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A AS A CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER(sw04372-B_010727-011574)
WELL I THINK THAT IF IF POLICY IS ESTABLISHED AND IF A MECHANISM IS PUT INTO PLACE TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IN THIS FASHION(sw04372-B_014832-016168)
THEN I DON'T ARGUE WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER TO REMEMBER THAT OH I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF STATE I NEED  TO XEROX THE RECEIPT AND MAKE OUT A CHECK FOR SIX PERCENT AND SEND IT TO PENNSYLVANIA(sw04372-B_016168-017436)
RIGHT BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT BUSINESSES DO THAT THE BUSINESS THAT YOU PURCHASE THE THING FROM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE APPROPRIATE SALES TAX AND FORWARDING IT TO THE STATE IN QUESTION THAT'S A COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE BURDEN SHOULDN'T BE PLACED ON THE CONSUMER(sw04372-B_017600-019005)
AH(sw04372-B_019463-019594)

SO MY ONLY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CONSUMER(sw04372-B_024934-025380)
UM BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE IF THE BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING THEMSELVES THEN I THINK SOME WELL DEFINED MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IN PLACE SO THAT(sw04372-B_025498-026472)
