ARCH HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT
OH THAT YEAH FINE KIND OF TIRED
WHERE AM I CALLING
WHERE ARE YOU
LEWISVILLE OKAY I'M IN GARLAND UM HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THEY PROPOSE TO UH COME UP WITH THE TAXES TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
BUT WE'RE NOT FUNDING THEM LIKE OTHER STATES EITHER THOUGH YOU KNOW IT WE'RE NOT FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS LIKE OTHER STATES EITHER
THAT'S RIGHT BUT JUST BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM
I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WASTE IN IN SCHOOLS I'M A TEACHER I FEEL THAT YES I F- I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT WAY ALL THIS MONEY THAT'S BEING PAID FOR ADMINISTRATORS
HUM-UM I CAN
WELL THEY'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT FREEDOM OF CHOICE YOU KNOW FOR SCHOOLS THAT'S AN IDEA
THAT'S TRUE
BUT LIKE IN GARLAND  UM
LIKE IN GARLAND THEY GET TO CHOOSE THE SCHOOLS THAT THEY'RE GONNA GO TO BUT THEY GOT TO HAVE THE TRANSPORTATION TO THEM IF IT'S OUT OF THEIR DISTRICT YOU KNOW OUT OF THEIR AREA I MEAN
SO AND I LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND OUT THE GOOD SCHOOLS IN YOUR AREA
SO JUST DISTRIBUTE IT EQUALLY AND NOT RAISE TAXES
YEAH WHAT DO YOU DO
OH SO YOU PICKED A GOOD FIELD THEN YOU PICKED A GOOD FIELD
WELL
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD ONE
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A STATE INCOME TAX
BUT DIDN'T THEY PASS THAT THING THAT WE WERE GONNA HAVE A LOTTERY OR NOT
OH
SO WHAT ABOUT YOUR INCOME TAX
THINK THEY'RE HITTING YOU TOO HARD
NO
HUH-UH
WHICH JUST KEEPS ACCUMULATING  WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEM LET'S SEE THE STATE
AND THE CITY TAX THE SALE TAX THEY USED TO YOU REALLY DIDN'T EVEN THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHEN YOU BOUGHT SOMETHING BUT NOW YOU DO  IT FIGURES IN WHAT IS IT SEVEN POINT
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THEY FIGURE IT REALLY I'M GLAD I DON'T WORK IN A STORE
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO FIGURE THIS SEVEN POINT SOMETHING PERCENT I GUESS THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE TABLE THOUGH AND IT'S ALL WRITTEN OUT
SO IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD  ALL RIGHT SO YOU THINK
FEDERAL TAX IS OKAY
STATE TAX YOU CAN SEE THE LOGIC OF IT BUT
YOU DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE FOR YOUR FAMILY AND OURS SEE BOTH OF US ARE TEACHERS AND WE GOT FOUR IN OUR FAMILY TOO
WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE
BUT WE CAN DO THIS TAX SHELTERED ANNUITY THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S SAVING US
PAR-
LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET IT
BUT STILL I WORK IN SOUTHEAST DALLAS
AND A LOT OF MY CHILDREN ARE FROM POOR
YOU KNOW SOCIOECONOMIC AREAS HOMES AND IT'S JUST LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE MONEY THEY THEY ALWAYS ARE DRESSED NICE YOU KNOW MOST OF THEM ARE FAIRLY NICE NOT LIKE YOU WOULD THINK A A POOR PERSON WOULD BE
AND I MEAN THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT DESSERT MONEY OR THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT YOU KNOW DOLLARS ON THEM AND EVERYTHING AND I'M THINKING YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE MY CHILDREN DON'T HAVE THAT
YEAH AND YOU GIVE THEM YOU KNOW THEY GET THEIR FREE LUNCH AND THEY THROW MOST OF IT AWAY BUT THEN THEY HAVE THEIR MONEY TO GO BUY DESSERT AND THAT THEY EAT
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST YOU SEE GARBAGE PANS I MEAN PAILS JUST FILLED AND WE PAY PEOPLE TO HAUL THEM OFF RIGHT
AND THE LIKE A GUY DOES IT AND HE HAS HIS OWN PIGS
THAT HE
YEAH IT IS OH WELL IS THAT YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY I DON'T THINK I DO
OKAY WELL TA- TALK TO YOU LATER THEN BYE
GOOD AND YOURSELF
YEAH ME TOO
PARDON ME
I'M IN LEWISVILLE
LITTLE BIT
THAT'S A HARD ISSUE TO DECIDE UH ON THE ONE HAND YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO TAKE AWAY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU DON'T WANT UH THE POORER SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GO UNDER EITHER AND UH HERE IN LEWISVILLE THEY HAD A THING ON THE BALLOT THAT THEY WANTED TO
UH ROLLBACK THE TAXES ON EVERYBODY'S HOUSES AND EVERYBODY WOULD SAVE
UH TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR OR WHATEVER BUT IT WOULD CUT BACK TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TO THE SCHOOLS AND I HAPPENED TO KNOW A GOOD TEACHER HERE IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SHE WAS REALLY AGAINST IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST TAKE AWAY ALL ALL THEIR MONEY
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED YOU KNOW HEY TWENTY BUCKS A YEAR IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ME AND THEY COULD RAISE A FEW MORE DOLLARS AND GET BETTER UH THINGS FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED BECAUSE WE GOT
YOU KNOW TEXAS IS KNOWN FOR IT'S POOR SCHOOLS AND THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE WE GOT LITTLE KIDS AND WE'RE UH NOT TOO PLEASED ABOUT THAT
PARDON ME
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH I KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM
I THINK WE'RE GONNA S-
ARE YOU
OKAY
I THINK WERE GONNA SEE A DAY COME
YEAH
I THINK I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE A DAY WHEN S- UH GRADE SCHOOLS ARE GONNA BE CHARGING TUITION JUST LIKE COLLEGES ARE UH AND IT'LL ONLY BE TO THOSE WHO ARE HAVING KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST FAIR WAY BUT
YOU KNOW UH THAT WAY OLD PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE HAVE MONEY GOING TO THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE LITTLE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOLS
BUT UH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THAT HAPPENS WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS UH THAT SORT OF THING HAPPENING AND UH WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
YEAH
YES
UM
I DON'T KNOW THAT I THINK HAS
PLUSES AND MINUSES BECAUSE UH THOSE THAT
ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED WON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE A CHOICE THE CHOICE WILL BE THRUST UPON THEM AND SO WHERE'S THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE NO FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN THAT CASE AND THAT'S
YES
YES
I THINK THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GONNA REALLY GET TO THE PROBLEM AND SOLVE IT IS TO HAVE EQUAL FUNDING FOR EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE WHETHER YOU IT'S IN A POOR TAX DISTRICT OR A HIGH TAX DISTRICT AND UH
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN SEE IT'S GONNA BE RESOLVED IS THERE ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE IN THE RICH DISTRICT THAT ARE GONNA FIGHT THAT AND AND IT'S GONNA BE A REAL BAD MESS BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE ON EVERY SIDE OF THE PROBLEM
YEAH
AND THEY SHOULD GIVE EVERY TEACHER A A HUNDRED PERCENT RAISE  THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THE TEACHERS DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY AND ANYBODY WHO COULD BE A GOOD TEACHER DOESN'T WANT TO BECOME A TEACHER USUALLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY ENOUGH
I MEAN WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I DID A LOT OF TEACHING UH FOR MY DEGREE AND UH I GOT A LOT OF GOOD OUT OF THAT AND I LIKED TEACHING BUT I REALLY COULDN'T GO INTO TEACHING BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE FOR ME TO DO SO
I'M A MATHEMATICIAN
PARDON ME
OH I DON'T KNOW THERE ARE BETTER FIELDS TO PICK
I MEAN
YEAH WHERE I YOU KNOW KIND OF STUFF I DO I I USE MY EDUCATION QUITE A BIT BUT WHERE I WAS BEFORE I WASN'T USING IT HARDLY AT ALL
SO IT ALL DEPENDS I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU WIND UP I GUESS BUT I REALLY ENJOYED TEACHING IT YOU KNOW I BUT WOULDN'T MIND GETTING BACK INTO IT SOMEDAY BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE
THE WAY PEOPLE ARE BEING LAID OFF RIGHT AND LEFT IT'S ALL A MATTER OF UH WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
BUT UH BA- BACK TO THE TAXES THOUGH I MEAN UH IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE NO ONE WANTS THEIR TAXES RAISED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING
I CAN SEE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A REASON FOR ONE BUT I WOULD HATE TO DO THAT BECAUSE UH THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR MY FAMILY FINANCIALLY TO TO AFFORD A STATE INCOME TAX
AND
MOST STATES HAVE IT I KNOW AND I'VE LIVED IN STATES THAT HAVE HAD IT BUT
WAY UH WAY FINANCING IS NOW IF WE HAD A STATE INCOME TAX I'D UH HAVE A VERY HARD TIME FINANCING MY HOUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW PAYING OFF MY MORTGAGE EACH MONTH THAT'S SO THAT'S A PROBLEM
UM
WHICH JUST MATTER OF WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS I'D RATHER HAVE THAT I GUESS THAN HAVE A S- STATE LOTTERY BECAUSE WHEN YOU BRING
NO IT DIDN'T
WHICH MEANS THERE'S A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF NOW HAVING A STATE INCOME TAX EVEN THOUGH GOOD OLD TAX AND SPEND ANNIE MY FAVORITE
UH DECIDED THAT UH DURING THE CAMPAIGN SHE SAID WE WEREN'T GONNA HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX AND NOW SHE'S GONNA RENEGE ON THAT WHICH I EXPECTED HER TO DO ANYWAY UH WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS I DON'T KNOW
AT ANY RATE UH
THAT
ACTUALLY NO UM
I'M SURPRISED THAT M- UH MY INCOME TAXES ARE AS LOW AS THEY ARE UH WE JUST FINISHED OUR INCOME TAXES AND WE'RE GETTING A NICE LITTLE REFUND BACK THIS YEAR WHICH IS WHICH IS NICER THAN HAVING TO PAY OUT
UH WHICH IS A MATTER OF UH
UM I'M SURPRISED IT'S
WELL CONSIDERING THE NATIONAL BUDGET I THINK GEORGE BUSH WANTED ONE POINT FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS
FOR THE NATIONAL BUDGET AND FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR LIKE WHAT I GOT THAT COMES OUT TO OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE IT IT'S OUR SHARE TO PAY IN BUT I'M NOT PAYING THAT MUCH INCOME TAX
AND YOU'RE GONNA THINK WELL WAIT NOW  WHERE'S THE OTHER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR WHATEVER COMING IN WH- HOW HOW IS THAT COMING FROM ME I GUESS IT COMES FROM COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES AND WHATNOT BUT
IT'S INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T IMAGINE I GUESS THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING IN DEBT SO DEEPLY
THEY BRING IN HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS AND THEY SPEND ONE POINT FOUR AND THEN THE REST GOES TO TO THE NATIONAL DEBT
THAT'S ABOUT IT I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH
SEVEN PERCENT OR SOMETHING IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE AT SOME PLACES IN DALLAS I GUESS IT'S LIKE CLOSER TO EIGHT AND PLACES LIKE IN LEWISVILLE IT'S A LOT CLOSER TO SEVEN
HUM-UM
HOW'S THAT
OH YES
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT
NO
YEAH
AND SO WHEN YOU START TAKING TALKING TAKING MORE OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK TO GO TO THE STATE INCOME TAX
UH
YEAH I THINK WHAT WE N- WHAT UH THE GOVERNMENT THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO IS GET IN THERE AND CUT SPENDING
BECAUSE WHEN THEY GOT ALL THIS FRAUD AND WASTE GOING ON THEY NEED TO JUST GET IN THERE AND AND GET OUT THE GARBAGE THAT'S IN THERE RIGHT NOW I MEAN I ONCE HEARD THAT UH
UH FOR THE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT LEAST THAT IF THEY UH
UH WELL FOR LIKE ON THE WELFARE SYSTEM IF THEY GAVE ALL THAT MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE EVERY WELFARE RECIPIENT WOULD BE MAKING LIKE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY THEY'RE MAKING PROBABLY MORE LIKE FIVE OR SIX ON THE WELFARE SO WHERE'S THE OTHER NINETY PERCENT GOING WELL IT'S GOING TO THE SOME FAT GUY IN THE MIDDLE WHO'S SITTING THERE ON HIS BEHIND ALL DAY DOING NOTHING BUT FILLING OUT PAPERS
LOTS OF PEOPLE YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WELL I DON'T HAVE THAT  A LOT OF TIMES IF I'VE GOT A DOLLAR IN MY WALLET IT'S LIKE BOY WHERE DO I G- WHERE DID WHERE'D I FIND THAT
WOW
YEAH RIGHT
QUITE A QUITE A WORLD WE LIVE IN

IT'S NORTH OF SHERMAN
UH IT NOT TOO FAR
HUH
UH I'VE BEEN THROUGH THERE
OKAY OH YEAH I HAD BEEN THROUGH SAINT JOE BUT UM JUST AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WATCHING THE NEWS AND READING THE PAPERS AND ALL THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CRIMES IN THE CITIES ARE REALLY GETTING BAD
UM-HUM
OH YEAH
SURE
UH-HUH
OH I KNOW I KNOW
I KNOW UM PEO- I THINK NOWADAYS PEOPLE JUST REALLY JUST MURDER IS NOTHING TO THEM YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
YEAH
UM-HUM YEAH BECAUSE UH MOST LIKELY THAT WILL HAPPEN WON'T IT THAT YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
NO
YEAH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
HUM
UH-HUH
HUM SO YOU'RE YOU'RE KIND OF THINKING IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU GET IF YOU DO SOMETHING THE FIRST TIME THAT'S NOT REAL BAD YOU KNOW
YEAH TO GO AHEAD AND LET THEM GO BUT IF THEY DO IT AGAIN AND THEY REALLY NEED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES THEN UH
OH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
NO APPARENTLY NOT BECAUSE LOOK HOW MANY YEARS THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT AND LOOK  I MEAN YEAH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THREE OR FOUR TIMES YEAH
THAT IS TRUE I KNOW
UM-HUM OH I'M I AGREE VERY MUCH SO ON THAT I YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
COMES YEAH
UM-HUM
SURE THEY JUST THINK THAT'S THE NORMAL THING TO DO DON'T THEY
Y- YEAH
UM-HUM
IN THE FIRST GRADE
OH NO
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
OH I KNOW I KNOW UM  I WORK IN SCHOOL
YOU KNOW THAT'S HUH-UH BUT SOMETHING I DO AND I IT REALLY IS I'M LIKE YOU ASTONISHING WHAT THE YOUNGER AGES KNOW AND THEY REACT TO WHAT THEY SEE AT HOME YOU KNOW
IF THEY SEE VIOLENCE AT HOME THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE KIDS AT SCHOOL YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS
AND THAT'S KIND OF SAD
UH-HUH
YEAH
UM-HUM
TEEN
HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
CAUSE YEAH
RIGHT
WHERE IS THAT
NORTH SOUTH EAST OR WEST
WELL YOU LIVE ALMOST IN OKLAHOMA
YEAH THAT'S KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE TOO FAR FROM OKLAHOMA EITHER
YOU KNOW WHERE SAINT JOE IS
I'M ABOUT EIGHT MILES SOUTH OF IT
WELL YOU KNOW
I'VE I'VE SEEN THOSE STATISTICS AND EVERYTHING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT FRIGHTENS ME
IS THAT YOU PUT A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT
WITH HIGH TECH WEAPONRY
YOU KNOW I MEAN
THE IRAQIS DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF HIGH-TECH WEAPONRY BUT THEY HAD MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS TANKS AND ALL THAT
AND THEY DIDN'T KILL AS MANY PEOPLE IN
IN FORTY FIVE DAYS
AND THEY WERE INTENDING TO KILL PEOPLE I MEAN THAT WAS THEIR JOB
AS THEY KILLED IN WASHINGTON DC
WELL
I FORMULATED A PRETTY RADICAL THEORY
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I GUESS
AND
I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
AND THIS IS
A PRETTY SCARY THOUGHT TO ME EVEN
THAT IF A GUY IS CONVICTED OR A GAL IS CONVICTED OF A CRIME
RATHER THAN PUT THEM IN PRISON BECAUSE PRISON'S PROVEN NOT TO WORK
JUST LET THEM GO
SAY OKAY YOU'RE CONVICTED
AND JUST LET THEM GO
AND IF THEY GET CONVICTED AGAIN
WELL JUST KILL THEM
WELL I THINK THAT
THE BEST HOPE
TO ELIMINATE
CRIME
AS WE KNOW IT TODAY
IS TO ELIMINATE THE CRIMINALS FROM SOCIETY
IF SOMEONE IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN PRISON THEY CAN'T GET A JOB
YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY
YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTED INTO SOCIETY THEN EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BECOME SOCIOPATHIC
AND YOU KNOW WHO'S TO PUT THE LIMIT ON IT
I MEAN I WAS WATCHING A THING LAST NIGHT UP IN WASHINGTON STATE
IF YOU GET CONVICTED OF UH
SEXUAL OFFENSES
ON A REGULAR BASIS I MEAN SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE FORTY YEARS OLD AND GOT TEN CONVICTIONS
AND THEY'RE STILL LET OUT ON THE STREET AFTER ONE OR TWO YEARS
WELL IN WASHINGTON STATE IF YOU'RE A HABITUAL SEXUAL OFFENDER
THEY JUST DON'T LET YOU OUT
UH YOU SERVE YOUR PRISON TERM
AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE MENTAL HOSPITAL AND IF YOU'RE PRONOUNCED CURED THEY'LL LET YOU GO
WELL
THEY MAY FIND A CURE FOR IT BUT THERE IS NO KNOWN CURE NOW
YOU KNOW
HEY PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES
WELL
YEAH USE THAT OR YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER CONSEQUENCES RATHER THAN KILLING THEM YOU KNOW YOU COULD ALWAYS MAKE THEM THE SLAVE OF THE PEOPLE THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME AGAINST
YOU KNOW
AT LEAST THEY MIGHT BE SOME BENEFIT IN THAT AND IF THE PEOPLE THEY COMMITTED A CRIME AGAINST
FEEL AT SOME LATER DATE THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED THEIR LESSON ARE ARE OKAY YOU KNOW WELL THEY CAN FREE THEM
BUT UH YOU KNOW WITH THE TECH- TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY YOU CAN PUT A COLLAR ON A GUYS LEG
THAT WILL KNOCK HIM DOWN IF THEY LEAVE THE PROPERTY
I MEAN IT WILL JUST IN INCAPACITATE THEM
AND YOU CAN PUT A COLLAR AROUND A GUYS LEG
THAT WILL
PROHIBIT THEM
FROM COMMITTING ANY KIND OF
YOU KNOW PROHIBITIVE ACT
BUT YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM IN PRISON MY GOD THAT DOESN'T WORK
WELL YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE TURKEY
TURKEY HAS DEATH PENALTY FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING
I MEAN IF YOU GET
CONVICTED OF UH YOU KNOW DRUG TRAFFICKING THEY JUST KILL YOU
YOU GET CONVICTED OF UH
YOU KNOW UH HEINOUS CRIMES
THEY JUST KILL YOU I MEAN THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT
AND UH
YOU LOOK AT THEIR SOCIETY AND THE REPEAT OFFENDERS ARE VERY FEW
YOU KNOW AND YOU LOOK AT OUR SOCIETY
ALMOST EVERYONE OUT ON THE STREET
THAT HAS BEEN IN PRISON HAS BEEN IN PRISON THREE OR FOUR TIMES
RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW THE WAY TO STOP THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR
IS THIS TWO FOLD
ONE
YOU NEED TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR
BOTH PARENTS TO WORK WHILE THE KIDS ARE UNDER SEVEN
I- I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
AND THEN
IF A PARENT HAS PROVED TO BE UNFIT
FOR ANY REASON
TAKE THE KIDS AWAY FROM THE PARENTS
BECAUSE
YOU KNOW WE ARE WHAT WE TEACH
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR SOCIETY BECOMES I MEAN WE HAVE A JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
AND I'VE AND I'VE I'VE LIVED IN THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS WHEN I WAS DOING CONSTRUCTION WORK
YOU KNOW AND THESE GUYS THEY COME TO WORK EVERY MORNING AND THEY'RE STONED TO THE BONE
I MEAN THEIR SO HIGH THEY COULD FLY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT BUILDING
AND THEY WORK ALL DAY AND THEY GO HOME AND THEY SMOKE THEIR DOPE AND DRINK THEIR BOOZE AND SHOOT THEIR DRUGS
AND WHEN THEY RUN OUT OF MONEY THEY GO DOWN TO THE CORNER STORE AND POP THE GUY ON THE HEAD AND TAKE HIS MONEY AND THEN THEY GO BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY
AND THE KIDS OF THESE PEOPLE
ARE PHENOMENALLY
THEY'RE SOCIOPATHIC
AND I WORKED IN A FIRST GRADE UH CLASSROOM
FOR ONE FULL SEMESTER
AND THESE KIDS WERE MORE FOUL MOUTHED THAN I'VE EVER BEEN
I HAD ONE KID THREATEN MY LIFE FIRST GRADER
THREATEN MY LIFE TOLD ME THAT DADDY'S GOING TO WHOOP ME TO DEATH
YOU KNOW AND THEY FLIPPING ME THE FINGER AND ALL THAT
AND I JUST SAID TO THIS KID I SAID YOU GOT TWO CHOICES KID YOU CAN STEP INTO MAINSTREAM SOCIETY OR YOU CAN DIE
BECAUSE YOU WILL EVENTUALLY BE KILLED
AND  YOU KNOW I JUST I'M JUST TOTALLY A- AGHAST AT A WHAT'S GOING ON
UM-HUM
EXACTLY
WELL YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE WORK PLACE
YOU KNOW
USED TO BE WHEN YOU HAD A
PERSONALITY CONFLICT YOU JUST YOU WORKED WITH IT AND YOU GOT THROUGH IT
NOW
YOU KNOW PEOPLE GET FIRED
OR
WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS THEY PROMOTE THEM INTO A POSITION THAT THEY CAN'T HANDLE AND LET THEM GET FIRED
OR ONE THING OR THE OTHER YOU LOOK AT ANOTHER KIND OF SOCIETY LIKE THE JAPANESE
YOU PUT
THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THAT SMALL OF A SPACE THEY'VE LEARNED TO LIVE TOGETHER
OKAY IT'S IN THEIR CULTURE
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IN THEIR CULTURE THAT I REALLY THINK THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO IS THE FACT THAT WHILE JAPAN WAS BECOMING A GREAT POWER FINANCIALLY
THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED FOR THOSE COMPANIES
WORKED FOR THE SAME COMPANY THEY WORKED FOR AT SIXTY FIVE AS THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN
AND THE COMPANY TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO FIND A POSITION FOR THESE PEOPLE
IF THEY WEREN'T FIT FOR THE JOB THEY WERE HIRED FOR THEY DIDN'T JUST CAN THEM
THEY MADE A POSITION FOR THEM SOME WHERE
UH YOU LOOK AT UH FRITO LAY MY WIFE USED TO WORK FOR FRITO LAY
AS A TYPIST
YOU KNOW TRANSCRIBING STUFF INTO THE COMPUTER
WELL SHE CAN TYPE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE WORDS PER MINUTE
BUT SHE DON'T LIKE IT
SHE SHE JUST DOESN'T LIKE TO DO THAT I MEAN SHE WILL
UM-HUM
WELL YES OF COURSE WE DO HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND WE'VE YOU KNOW DONE AWAY WITH OUR QUOTE FAIR SHARE NUMBER
YES
YES IT'S CERTAIN CRIMES UH CAPITAL CRIMES MURDER OF COURSE UH RAPE THIS SORT OF THING
AND IT SEEMS TO BE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF BLACKS YOU KNOW GET INTO THE SYSTEM
UM-HUM YES TH-
THAT HAPPENS ON OCCASION IT SURE DOES MAYBE IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW HOW CLOSELY THE CRIME YOU KNOW HAS AFFECTED YOU PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW OR A PERSON PERSONALLY
I THINK I WOULD BE  YOU KNOW I GUESS REALLY IF I HAD TO SAY YES OR NO I GUESS I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT
I AM IN CERTAIN CASES IN FAVOR OF THE DEATH PENALTY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A BIG DETERRENT REALLY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'D EVER FIND OUT YOU KNOW REALLY WHETHER IT IS OR NOT
OH YEAH OH ABSOLUTELY YEAH IT GOES ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND COSTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TAXPAYER MONEY
YEAH
YES
YES UM-HUM
YEAH IT IS IT'S IT'S A TOUGH TOUGH QUESTION IT REALLY IS
I SUSPECT I WOULD BE UH YOU KNOW A LOT MORE FAVOR OF IT IF YOU KNOW ONE OF MY CHILDREN WERE YOU KNOW BRUTALLY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE I SAY I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW PERSONALLY AFFECTED YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT BE BY IT
OH ABSOLUTELY
TH-
THAT'S RIGHT
NOT WITH ME PERSONALLY IT IS WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE
IT'S NOT NOT TO ME PERSONALLY NO
NO
UM-HUM
YES
THAT'S A IT'S A TOUGH TOUGH QUESTION IT REALLY IS
YES I THINK MOST STATES DO HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT YES
BUT I THINK THE US IS ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES THAT STILL DO
YES THEY'RE ONLY I WAS READING SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE O- DAY I I WANNA  THINK THERE'S ONLY LIKE SIX OR EIGHT COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT STILL
A LOT OF THEM HAD TO HAVE EL- ELECTED NOT TO DO SO NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO IN PLACE OF IT YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S
LIFE IMPRISONMENT OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY HANDLE IT BU-
I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT SO FEW COUNTRIES HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
OH YEAH
YES A LOT OF THEM DO GET THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED TO SOMETHING ELSE
YES
UH-HUH YES
RIGHT THE FIRST APPEAL IS AUTOMATIC SO
THAT DELAYS IT FOR A FEW YEARS JUST RIGHT OFF THE BAT
THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW LAST MINUTE UH
THINGS THAT HAPPEN CAUSE A PERSON NOT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING
YES UH-HUH THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY RECENT I DON'T KNOW HOW RECENT BUT FAIRLY RECENT IN THE STATE OF TEXAS BEFORE THAT IT WAS UH DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION
YES IT CERTAINLY DOES
YES IT WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO BE I SUPPOSE IF YOU IF YOU HAD TO CHOSE I GUESS I WOULD I AM SURE I WOULD TAKE THE LETHAL INJECTION
YES ABSOLUTELY
IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION IT REALLY IS I GUESS IF I HAD TO SAY
YOU KNOW YES OR NO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW YES I- I WOULD HAVE TO LEAN TOWARD CAPITAL PUNISHMENT YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN CRIMES
NO I DON'T THINK IT'S A MONETARY THING I THINK WE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE YOU KNOW
SOME SORT OF DETERMENT DETERRENT OR YOU KNOW AN EYE FOR AN EYE TYPE THING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SOME OF THE CRIMES ARE JUST SO BRUTAL AND SO YOU KNOW USELESS
THIS MAY S- SEEM TO BE THE BEST WAY OUT I DON'T KNOW
EASIEST WAY OUT MAYBE
NO I DON'T THINK IT'S A MONETARY THING
YES ESPECIALLY THE MURDER RATE ITS JUST GONE CRAZY
YES ABSOLUTELY
YES I WISH I HAD THE ANSWER FOR THAT EVERYBODY DOES
YES IT'S NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF CERTAINLY NOT
YES
SO HAVE WE BEEN VERY VERY FORTUNATE
THAT'S RIGHT ABSOLUTELY
UM-HUM
ABSOLUTELY
UH-HUH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
SO WOULD I- I FORTUNATELY NEVER BEEN IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE I HOPE I NEVER AM LIKE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
SURE IT'S IT'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY IT REALLY IS
YES
SO WOULD I
YES ABSOLUTELY
IT IS IT'S A TOUGH SUBJECT IT REALLY IS
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
WELL THANK YOU IT'S NICE TALKING TO YOU UH-HUH BYE BYE
WELL I AM NEW TO TEXAS SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS IN THE STATE DO YOU
OH THAT'S RIGHT I THINK NOW THAT I RECALL READING ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER
UM YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS IS IT RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN CRIMES OR JUST
UM-HUM HUM
WELL
YES I KNOW THE ONE THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY SAD ABOUT IT AS I RECALL FROM THE ARTICLES THAT I'VE READ IS THAT IF IF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE
ARE GOING TO BE KILLED
AND UM-HUM THEY'RE VERY VIOLENT AND THEY WANT I MEAN THEY'RE ANXIOUS FOR SOMEONE TO BE KILLED AND I JUST I CAN'T SEE THAT
UH-HUH
NO
WELL THERE IS SO MANY CHANCES FOR APPEAL THAT IT KEE-
YEAH IT'S REALLY SAD I DON'T KNOW I JUST THINK UM
SOMEHOW I HOPED THAT AS A PEOPLE WE COULD BE BETTER THAN THAN UM EXPECTING
THE FEELING THAT IT RIGHT WITH SOMEONE IS CALLING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO BE KILLED YOU KNOW
IS REALLY KIND OF BAD AND
HUM
THAT'S TRUE AND THERE REALLY ARE CRIMINALS THAT ARE HARD-CORE AND REPEAT AND NE- NEVER HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR
OH I DON'T KNOW IS IT DO YOU FEEL AT ALL LIKE IT'S A RELIGIOUS ISSUE
UM-HUM
HUM
I DON'T KNOW SOMETIMES I FEEL I MEAN I DO GO TO CHURCH AND THINGS I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD FEEL ABOUT IT BUT LIKE YOU SAY IF IT HIT YOU PERSONALLY CLOSER AT HOME YOU WOULD FEEL FEEL DIFFERENTLY
DO YOU THINK MOST STATES HAVE THAT OR
UM-HUM HUM
THAT STILL DOES IT THAT'S RIGHT
UM-HUM
HAVE THAT WELL AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE VERY MANY PEOPLE UH ARE REALLY I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ON DEATH ROW BUT THERE'S NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY UM DO GET KILLED
UM-HUM
SO SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND THEN
THROUGH APPEALS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DO FREQUENTLY I MEAN THEY COVER COVER IT PRETTY HEAVILY ON TELEVISION AND THE NEWSPAPER
IF IT FINALLY GETS TO THAT POINT
YEAH
UM-HUM
SO IS IT UH  ARE WE DOING LETHAL INJECTION NOW
UM-HUM WH- WHICH SEEMS SO AWFUL
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMANE I GUESS IT IS
YES THE OTHER ONE JUST SEEMS SO TERRIBLE
HUM
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO DETER CRIME OR IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR INMATES TO STAY IN PRISON
UM-HUM
HUM
YES
HUM
WELL UM I NOTICE THAT THE CRIME RATE WAS UP IN THE DALLAS AREA  IT'S
AND IT'S KIND OF BEEN SCARY TO THINK ABOUT IT AND
YOU'RE HOPING THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL CUT DOWN ON THAT
YOU HATE TO HAVE THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF BEING
YOU KNOW SO HIGH IN THE
IN STATISTICS
BUT I YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN REALLY FORTUNATE OUR FAMILY HASN'T HAD
ANY CRIME
AND SO WE DON'T
IT'S HARDER TO THINK ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUFFERED THAT WAY
AND HOW THEY WOULD EXPECT HOW THEY WOULD
HOPE I MEAN YOU YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE UM COMMITTED CRIMES AND THEN THEY GET OUT OF JAIL AND THEY GO AND THEY DO THE SAME THING AGAIN AND YOU WONDER WHY THEY CAN'T JUST STOP IT
SO MAYBE YOU WOULD
BUT STILL I WOULD HATE TO BE ON THE JURY THAT SENTENCED SOMEONE
NO  I KNOW WHEN UM WE JUST WE MOVED HERE UM I FROM THE
I GOT A SUMMONS JURY SUMMONS JUST
LIKE CONSTANTLY IT SEEMED LIKE BUT FORTUNATELY I HAD SMALL CHILDREN AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND IT'S NOT THAT I MEAN I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE TO SERVE ON THE JURY IT'S JUST THAT
I DIDN'T I HATE HAVING TO BE IN CHARGE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE
AND I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO HEAR ANY KIND OF CASE INVOLVING A VIOLENT CRIME OR ANYTHING
THAT WOULD BE REALLY AWFUL
WELL ANYWAY I SURE HAVE ENJOYED UH  TALKING ABOUT THIS ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT BUT UH
I'D HATE TO DECIDE IT BUT I GUESS UM
GUESS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DECIDE AS A PEOPLE WHAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
ANYWAY WELL YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY

BUT UH THAT THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT THAT IS THIS GOING TO BE YOUR YOUR PERMANENT HOME OR OKAY
I SAW A LOG CABIN BUILT DOWN THERE THAT I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SIMILAR TO THE OPEN CONSTRUCTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE WHERE THE ONLY THING ENCLOSED UPSTAIRS WERE THE BEDROOMS
BUT THE REST OF THE CENTER PORTION OF THE CABIN WHICH WAS A HUGE HUGE HOUSE WAS ALL OPEN AND THE THING I REALLY LIKED ABOUT IT WAS IT HAD A PORCH ON ALL FOUR SIDES OF THE HOUSE

SO YOU'RE A WOODWORKER UH
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT TIMBER FRAMING
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT TIMBER FRAMING
RIGHT RIGHT
UH-HUH
YEAH THE REASON I ASKED IS BECAUSE
WE'RE EMBARKING ON A LITTLE ADVENTURE HERE
IN THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE UH SOME TIMBER FRAMING TECHNIQUES TO BUILD A
A TRUSS FOR A HOME
AND IT'S A IT'S A YOU KNOW WHAT A MANSARD ROOF IS
LIKE A BARN YEAH
AND THEY'RE MANSARD TRUSSES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY INTERNAL BRACING
SO THE WHOLE AREA IS LIKE A CATHEDRAL UP THERE
FOR THE SECOND FLOOR
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH THAT THAT'S DONE SOME WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY CREATE A A SINGLE PIECE THAT IS THE TRUST
BUT UH WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO MAKE FOUR IDENTICAL COMPONENTS
AND UH CUT THE JOINTS SO THAT THE
THE MORE PRESSURE YOU PUT ON IT THE STRONGER IT GETS
AND IT INVOLVES INTERLEAVING AND UH USING UH YOU KNOW LOCKING WEDGES
YEAH SIMILAR TO THAT YEAH
WELL IF I DO THAT AND THEN COVER IT WITH UH TWO BY SIX TONGUE AND GROOVE
IT WILL BE PRETTY STURDY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WE WE GOT WHAT WE CALL SANTA ANA WIND DOWN HERE
IT COMES UP OUT OF MEXICO AT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
WE'RE AT A THE COR- AT THE NORTHWEST OF DENTON TEXAS
RIGHT ON THE RED RIVER
YEAH WELL THEN YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT WIND
YEAH
YEAH YEAH WE WE BOUGHT THIS LAND OUT HERE WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO RETIRE ON IT
MAYBE IN TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW BUT
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STILL FAIRLY YOUNG
WELL WE'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE A PORCH ON NORTH AND SOUTH END
AND UH WE'LL HAVE SO- UH ANDERSON WINDOW WALLS IS WHAT THEY ARE
SO THE WHOLE WALL JUST OPENS UP IT WILL BE ALL GLASS
BECAUSE ON THE PIECE OF PROPERTY WE HAVE IT'S THE SECOND HIGHEST POINTED IN THE COUNTY
AND WE CAN SEE OKLAHOMA TO THE NORTH THE LIGHTS OF GAINESVILLE TO THE EAST AND THE LIGHTS OF WICHITA FALLS TO THE WEST
AND THAT'S A AND IT'S IT'S A WE'RE JUST RIGHT ON THE SOUTHERN RIM OF THE RED RIVER VALLEY
WELL YOU KNOW WHERE NOCONA IS
NOCONA
OKAY THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR NORTH AS WE CAN SEE JUST YOU KNOW RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE
AND BOY IT'S REALLY NICE IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR DRIVE TO WORK THOUGH
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TRAFFIC
YEAH
WELL I USED TO LIVE IN UH SPRINGFIELD WELL ACTUALLY CHICOPEE FALLS
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE
YEAH IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN WE'RE DIGGING THE FOUNDATION BY HAND
YEAH THE FIRST FLOOR'S GOING TO BE UNDERGROUND
AND IT OF COURSE IT WILL BE OPEN ON THE SOUTH AND NORTH END
AND EAST AND WELL SEE WE HAVE A LITTLE KNOLL ON OUR PROPERTY ABOUT THIRTY FEET TALL AND IT'S ALMOST STRAIGHT UP SO WE'LL NESTLE THE HOUSE RIGHT UP NEXT TO IT
RIGHT
COOLING WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HEAT I MEAN
YEAH BUT THEY'RE VERY SHORT
WELL THE TEMPERATURE TUESDAY WAS NINETY SIX
IT WENT FROM THIRTY EIGHT TO NINETY SIX ON TUESDAY THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD TEMPERATURE SWING
WELL IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WEATHER IN TEXAS JUST WAIT A MINUTE
WELL YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY
ALL RIGHTY
UH WHAT KIND OF UM
BESIDES Y- BESIDES YOUR SALARY WHAT'S WHAT'S THE MOST THE THING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER TO BE MOST IMPORTANT AS A BENEFIT
OH
HAVE YOU EVER WORKED FOR A LARGE ORGANIZATION
OH OKAY
OKAY
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU SAID RETIREMENT AND THAT REALLY HAS NOT EVEN OCCURRED TO ME ONCE
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
NO WHAT IS THAT
UM NO I HADN'T HEARD OF THAT
UM
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD IDEA
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL
I THINK OF UH YOU MEAN AS FAR AS RETIREMENT
I THINK THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME RIGHT NOW I- IS REALLY THE MEDICAL COVERAGE
UH
I AM IN UH
IN UH INVOLVED IN A FOUR 401K BUT I'M UH CONTRIBUTING SUCH A SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT RIGHT NOW
JUST TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE ACCOUNT OPEN BECAUSE UH
UH
I JUST LET'S SEE I'VE BEEN WITH THIS COMPANY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND BEFORE THAT
UH WE WERE
WE'RE WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO CATCH UP
WE WERE WE WERE WAY BEHIND FINANCIALLY AND SO HAVEN'T REALLY UH QUITE MANAGED TO CATCH UP YET
EXACTLY AND WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE WHICH COMPLICATES MATTERS EVEN FURTHER
YEAH
NO
NO THAT WOULD COMPLICATE THINGS EVEN MORE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY
UH-HUH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WELL THERE'S LETS SEE WHAT OTHER
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY HAS IT USED TO BE THAT THEY USED TO GIVE LIKE TWO WEEKS A YEAR AND NOW THEY GIVE ONE WEEK AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS
MOST MOST OF THE TIME NOW THEY DO THE FIRST WEEK AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS SO THAT IF SOMEBODY REALLY NEEDS THAT TIME
THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND USE IT THEN OR THEY CAN JUST WAIT THE FULL YEAR AND THEN HAVE TWO
SO IT WOR- IT WOULD WORK EITHER WAY
PROBABLY FIVE YEARS I THINK
OR SEVEN
UH THAT'S KIND OF FAR AWAY
OKAY UM
I'VE GOT ANOTHER CALL COMING IN
OKAY ALL RIGHT BYE BYE
ALL RIGHT
YEAH
WELL I GUESS UH
I I I'M KIND OF IN UH IN AN UNUSUAL SITUATION PROBABLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC BECAUSE I'M SELF-EMPLOYED
UH
BUT YES I HAVE WORKED I'VE WORKED FOR TI AND I'VE WORKED FOR LTV
UH AND I SUPPOSE THAT UH
SO FAR AS BENEFITS ARE CONCERNED THE MOST IMPORTANT
TO UH ME TODAY WOULD PROBABLY BE UH SOMETHING TO DO WITH RETIREMENT BENEFITS
AT AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE THOUGH I'M I'M I'M A LITTLE OLDER PROBABLY THAN YOU KNOW THAN THE TYPICAL NEW EMPLOYEE WOULD BE ANYWAY UH
IN YOU KNOW IN MY YOUNGER DAYS I I WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT'S THE VACATION POLICY
AND THEN AS I MATURED A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT ARE THE INSURANCE BENEFITS YOU KNOW
BUT UH SO I I YOU KNOW I GUESS IT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT DEPENDS ON
UH YOU KNOW ON
WHERE YOU ARE IN LIFE AS TO WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
AND UH
YEAH
YEAH UH YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT UH IF YOU HAVEN'T HAVEN'T LOOKED FORWARD TO YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN YOU RETIRE
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT THEN IT GETS TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOME PLANNING FOR IT UH YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF THE COMPANY IS NOT DOING IT FOR YOU
AND UH
THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT DO AND THERE COMPANIES THAT DON'T YOU KNOW THAT DON'T HAVE GOOD RETIREMENT PLANS
UH
I GUESS UH THE COMPANIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE 401K TYPE PLANS WHERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE THE UH OPTION OF CONTRIBUTING TO UH TO A RETIREMENT PLAN
AND UH MAYBE EVEN THE COMPANY DOES SOME KIND OF A MATCHING PROGRAM FOR THAT THAT'S THOSE ARE GOOD PROGRAMS UH
I I I'M A CPA SO I LOOK AT YOU KNOW I GET TO SEE A LOT OF THESE UH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THINGS AND ALONG THAT LINE
AND UH I LIKE TO SEE WHERE THE COMPANY MAKES THOSE MAKES BENEFITS AVAILABLE AT LEAST TO THE EMPLOYEES
SO THAT THEY CAN PICK AND CHOSE WHAT THEY LIKE UH
YOU KNOW THERE THEY'VE GOT ONE THAT THEY CALL A CAFETERIA PLAN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT OR NOT
AND UH ESSENTIALLY THE CAFETERIA PLANS ARE PROGRAMS WHERE
THE COMPANY MAKES AVAILABLE A A DIFFERENT UH UH DIFFERENT PACKAGES OF BENEFITS YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN PICK THE KIND OF INSURANCE YOU WANT AND THE KIND OF DENTAL COVERAGE AND THE KIND OF VACATION POLICY YOU WANT AN
AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU PICK THE ONES THAT YOU WANT AS LONG AS THE TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY ESSENTIALLY THE TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY
FITS YOU KNOW WITHIN THEIR GUIDELINES SO EVERY EMPLOYEE GETS THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT OF BENEFITS
BUT THEY CAN PICK THEM FROM DIFFERENT WHATEVER IS MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM
SO YOU CAN UH SO YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET THE INSURANCE PLAN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND SOMEBODY ELSE CAN GET THE VACATION PLAN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM
AND THE COMPANY WINDS UP PAYING THE SAME YOU KNOW THE SAME AMOUNT FOR EACH ONE
UH I BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN CHANGE WELL MAYBE NOT FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN CHANGE PERIODICALLY
UH AS TO YOU KNOW AS T- TO GET THE STUFF THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU YEAH THAT'S UH SOMETHING THAT THE UH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW PUT INTO UH YOU KNOW INTO THE IRS REGULATIONS AS UH AS
UH DEDUCTIONS UH ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS FOR COMPANIES THEY PUT THOSE IN OH FOUR OF FIVE YEARS AGO UH YOU KNOW THE THE DIFFERENT INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THINGS STARTED PROMOTING THOSE PLANS
AND UH I I THINK THERE YOU KNOW IT'S A PRETTY GOOD OPTION TO HAVE
OF COURSE THE 401- 401K IS IS A GOOD YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD SAVINGS VEHICLE
SO UH
ANYWAY UH
WHAT KIND OF PLANS ARE YOU ARE YOU IN NOW ARE WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN IN BEFORE
WELL AS SO FAR AS BENEFIT PACKAGES INDI- IN TOTAL
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH
YEAH SO
RIGHT YEAH IT'S AND IT'S UH IT IT'S UH UH A HASSLE TRYING TO TO UH
UH PUT YOUR MONEY ALL IN THE RIGHT IN THE S- YOU KNOW IN THE RIGHT POCKETS I GUESS IT WOULD BE A WAY TO SAY IT
YOU KNOW TO GET EVERYTHING DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND SO SO THEY I GUESS THE UH
YEAH THE YEAH THE MEDICAL INSURANCE WOULD REALLY BE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT IF YOU HAD UH IF YOU HAD CHILDREN I GUESS IF YOU'RE OF CHILD BEARING AGE THEN IT'S IMPORTANT TOO YOU KNOW BECAUSE
YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU GOT TO HAVE UH AT LEAST HAVE THE COVERAGE IN CASE THAT YOUR IN CASE YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR HAVE A CHILD
AND UH
YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT COVERAGE
SO ANYWAY UH
BUT WHAT ELSE
YEAH UH I GUESS UH WHAT WHAT KIND OF TYPICAL VACATION
PROGRAMS UH VACATION PLANS DO DO THE COMPANIES HAVE THAT YOU'VE WORKED FOR
UH SO FAR AS WHEN YOU GET VACATION AND HOW MUCH
UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S I HAVE NOT UH I HAVE NOT SEEN VACATION POLICIES YOU KNOW WRITTEN IN ABOUT SEVEN YEARS SO I'M NOT REAL SURE HOW THEY'RE HOW THEY'RE CHANGING WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT UH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD DEAL
YEAH HOW WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU FIND THAT THAT THEY'RE UH WHEN THEY CHANGE FROM TWO WEEKS TO THREE WEEKS IS IT FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS OR
YEAH UH
YEAH
IN THE PAST I'VE WORKED FOR COMPANIES YOU KNOW WHERE THEY THEY HAD A PRETTY GOOD UH PRETTY GOOD PL- UH VACATION POLICY YOU KNOW YOU GOT YOU GOT THE TWO WEEKS  THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THEY WENT UP

HE DIDN'T GET TO SEE MUCH ACTION BUT IT'S TOO BAD

I THINK TICKETS ARE YEAH
THIRTY OR THIRTY TWO FOR REALLY GOOD TICKETS SEE THEY THEY SECTIONED IT OUT EVEN MORE THEY USED TO JUST HAVE LIKE UH FIRST OF ALL IT WAS ALL ONE PRICE AND THEN THEY SECTIONED IT OUT TO END ZONE AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
AND NOW THEY'RE SECTIONING IT OFF TO LIKE FROM THE
FROM ONE TWENTY YARD LINE TO THE OTHER ONE JUST ON THE LOWER LEVELS IS THE HIGHEST PRICE
AND THEN THE NEXT HIGHEST PRICE IS THAT SAME AREA BUT ABOVE IT ON THE UPPER LEVEL AND THEN LIKE FROM THE TWENTY TO THE TEN YARD LINE AND THEN THEY'RE SOME SECTIONS KIND OF IN THE CORNER AREAS AND THEN THE CHEAPEST OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE THE END THE DIRECT END ZONES
BUT UM THEY HAVE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PRICES NOW THAT THEY'RE STRUCTURING IT WITH BUT OBVIOUSLY YEAH THEY'RE ALL GOING UP EVEN MORE OR LESS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO
UM YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT POSITIVE I DIDN'T
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT I JUST REMEMBER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU COULD GET THAT WAS REAL CLOSE TO THE GOOD SECTION BUT IN THE LITTLE BIT CHEAPER

AS GOOD AS AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS
YEAH
I THINK SO TOO
AND I- I UH AT LEWISVILLE I'M NOT FOND OF THEIR VEGETABLE SELECTION
UH
THEY HAVE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT A BIG VEGETABLE EATER THEY HAVE TOO MANY UH YELLOW VEGETABLES ON THE SAME DAY AND
AND IT S- SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S A VARIETY OF THE SAME TYPE OF VEGETABLE
LIKE THEY'LL HAVE UH
THEY'LL HAVE BROCCOLI AND THEY'LL HAVE SQUASH AND CAULIFLOWER ALL ON THE SAME DAY
AND THAT THAT DOESN'T
I'M I LIKE MORE OF A VARIETY THAN THAT
IN FACT ONE DAY THEY THEY HAD THEY HAD THREE KINDS OF POTATOES
THEY HAD MASHED POTATOES THEY HAD FRENCH FRIES AND THEY HAD AU GRATIN
THAT'S OVERDOING IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY'LL HAVE DRESSING BUT UH WHOEVER MAKES IT UH GOES CRAZY WITH THE SAGE

WITH THE GRILL TRYING TO GET THOSE THINGS HE LIKES TO PUT SOMETIMES EVEN HICKORY CHIPS ON THE BARBECUE YOU KNOW GET A LITTLE DIFFERENT FLAVOR
AND THEN YOU DO YOUR MASHED POTATO AND YOUR SALAD YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THAT THAT'LL PUSH PLEASE PRETTY MUCH ANY GUEST

BEFORE I CAME TO TEXAS BUT SHE IS ALWAYS SHE MAKES HER CORN BREAD AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW SHE USES THAT TO TO MAKE THE STUFFING WE DIDN'T DO THAT SO MUCH UH I'M FROM KIND OF LIKE OHIO AREA
AND UH WE'RE YOU KNOW NOT INTO THE CORN BREAD AS MUCH SO OUR STUFFING WAS UM LOT OF TIMES WAS UH LIKE SAUSAGE OR WHAT NOT WE WOULD MAKE IT WITH YOU KNOW VARIED UH MEATS LIKE THAT
INSIDE THE TURKEY AND THEN OF COURSE WE ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE MASHED POTATOES
AND YOUR STANDARD VEGETABLES LIKE YOU ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE SOME PEAS AND CORN
AND YOU GOT TO HAVE YOUR CRANBERRY SAUCE NOW I LIKE THE JELLIED KIND
AND YOU GOT TO HAVE YOUR PUMPKIN PIE
WELL YEAH
YEAH AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE PEOPLE CALL THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT AREAS UM
MY PARENTS GREW UP A LOT IN THE PHILADELPHIA AREA I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN WE LIVED THERE BUT YOU CALL THINGS DIFFERENTLY LIKE UM UH WE CALLED THEM ALL HOAGIES DOWN HERE THEY CALL THEM SUBMARINE SANDMICHES
AND WE DIDN'T EVER CALL IT UH COKES AND SUCH YOU KNOW WE CALL IT SODA
UM SO IT'S JUST DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY FOR THE SAME THING
YEAH THAT'S IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF BREAD AND IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A HARDER CRUST IT'S NOT THE SOFT
YOU KNOW KIND OF UH ROLLS THAT THEY HAVE HERE IT WAS A HARDER CRUST AND SOME OF THE HOAGIES WERE COOKED LIKE THE PHILADELPHIA UM STEAK
THE THE HOAGIE STEAK THAT THEY THEY SELL
UM
WELL WHAT IS IT FOR UM NEW YEAR'S LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE HAM AND SAUERKRAUT
UH I THINK THEY COOK CABBAGE UP NORTH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT
NOW WE ALWAYS HAD A HAM LIKE ON UH UH EASTER
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE A HAM OR SOMETHING ON EASTER
I THINK LAST LET ME TRY TO THINK I THINK THE LAST TIME WE HAD A BIG MEAL LIKE THAT WE DID HAVE BOTH I THINK WE DID HAVE BOTH ON THANKSGIVING  JUST IN CASE PEOPLE YOU KNOW HAVE A VARIETY
YEAH
OH THAT'S TRUE WELL UM YOU WORK HERE AT THE EXPRESSWAY SITE
OH LEWISVILLE  ANY DECENT FOOD IN YOUR CAFETERIA UP THERE
REALLY
OH
UM-HUM
HUM
WELL I NORMALLY WORK IN THE NORTH BUILDING AND UM YOU WOULD THINK THAT SINCE YOU KNOW THE EXECUTIVES ARE THERE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD ONE BUT
I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S JUST KIND OF STANDARD
OH
UM
UM
NOW THAT IS A LITTLE OVERDOING IT
WELL MY HUSBAND HE USED TO COMPLAIN AT THE CAFETERIA BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE SO MANY OF THEIR DIFFERENT ITEMS
THEY ALWAYS ADDED GARLIC TO IT LIKE HE WOULD GET TUNA SALAD THIS IS WHAT IS THAT AND THE FIRST INGREDIENT NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE MAKING GARLIC
AND HE SAID TUNA SALAD SHOULDN'T TASTE GARLICKY  BUT EVERYTHING ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE A GARLIC FLAVOR TO IT
UM
UM
WELL I'M I SPEND A LOT OF TIME OVER IN PARK CENTRAL
BUT WE HAVE JUST A LITTLE DELI DOWNSTAIRS BUT IN THE MORNINGS THEY MAKE THESE REALLY GOOD MUFFINS
THEY DON'T MAKE A LOT OF THEM AND I DON'T THINK THEY MAKE THEM AT OTHER PLACES THIS LITTLE DELI IS LIKE RC COOPER IT'S A LITTLE PLACE YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CHAIN HERE IN TOWN IT'S REAL SMALL
BUT UH THEY MAKE THE BEST MUFFINS WE'RE TALKING IT'S A REAL GOOD SIZE ONE YOU KNOW  AND THEY MAKE THEM DIFFERENT FLAVORS LIKE
AND UH THEY'LL HAVE LIKE A BANANA NUT AND A APPLE ONE AND A ZUCCHINI AND A BLUEBERRY
REALLY GOOD THEY USUALLY PRETTY MUCH GO FAST THEY DON'T MAKE A LOT OF THEM YOU HAVE TO GET HERE EARLY IN THE MORNING
PRETTY GOOD
UM-HUM
HUM
WELL YOU OUGHT TO TRY A MUFFIN IF YOU HAVEN'T
OH WELL WE ALL INDULGE RIGHT
WELL
YEAH I KNOW MY HUSBAND HE'LL COOK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE BUT LIKE THE KITCHEN IS A DISASTER AREA AFTERWARDS
BECAUSE HE HAS TO GET EVERYTHING OUT AND HE LOVES TO SEASON I MEAN HE'S LIKE HE GETS EVERY SEASONING OUT OF THE CUPBOARD YOU KNOW AND USES IT AND HE LIKES TO PUT LEMON
WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO FEEL UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UH THE POSSIBILITY OF PUERTO RICO BECOMING A STATE
YEAH WELL I QUESTION WHETHER IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS TO BECOME A STATE RIGHT NOW THEY ARE A COMMONWEALTH
AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE UNDER US PROTECTION IN THE EVENT OF UH DEFENDING THEIR THEIR COUNTRY
UH THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY VOTING PRIVILEGES THOUGH AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE ANY REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS
YEAH I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO PAY ANY UH LIKE FEDERAL TAX UH
UH YEAH I THINK THEY ARE THEY THEY DO GET UH PRIV- PRIVILEGES LIKE THAT
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT UH CARRIES ON
WELL I THINK WE'VE GOT UH LIKE A LANGUAGE BARRIER TOO I THINK MOST OF THE PEOPLE THERE SPEAK ONLY SPANISH I'M NOT SURE HOW FLUENT THEY ARE IN ENGLISH
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS I I SEE WITH UH
OTHER COUNTRIES AS SUCH BEING UH SAY THE POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING STATES THAT WE DON'T HAVE A COMMON LANGUAGE WITH THEM
RIGHT I THINK WE'D HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM SAY WITH MEXICO
UH CANADA ON THE OTHER HAND UH ENGLISH IS ONE OF THEIR NATIONAL LANGUAGES THEY HAVE
YEAH UH-HUH
SO I THINK THEY'RE
YEAH
I JUST SEE A LOT OF UH SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES THAT COULD UH POSE PROBLEMS WITH UH PUERTO RICO BECOMING A STATE
UM
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE STRONG ENOUGH MYSELF TO BECOME INDEPENDENT
UH I THINK THAT IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST RIGHT NOW JUST UH TO REMAIN AS IS
KEEP THE STATUS QUO AND UH KEEP UH STAY UNDER THE U- UNITED STATES PROTECTION
YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF THEY IF THEY TRIED FOR INDEPENDENCE THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE UH
MILITARY FACTIONS THAT WOULD OPPOSE EACH OTHER AND AND THEY WOULD VIE FOR LEADERSHIP AND UH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF THERE THE MIDDLE UPPER CLASS IF THERE IS SUCH A THING
UH THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE AT A DISADVANTAGE LOSING POSSIBILITY OF LOSING THEIR UH THEIR ASSETS OR WEALTH
UH
I DON'T SEE IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE
YEAH WELL I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE I'M NOT QUITE FAMILIAR WITH WITH UH THE WAY THEY DO THINGS
UH-HUH
YEAH OH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW PART OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THERE IS THAT THEY STILL REALLY ARE THIRD WORLD COUNTRY
AND THEY HAVEN'T UH CAUGHT UP UH ECONOMICALLY WITH UH SAY THE UNITED STATES
UH-HUH
OKAY
WELL DID YOU HAVE GUIDES FROM THE AREA OR ESCORTS OR UH
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH WELL THEY'VE GOT THAT LATIN BLOOD THEY GET FIRED UP ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING ANYWAY
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF UH ATTAINING A FIFTY FIRST STATE IS WHAT WOULD WE DO ABOUT OUR FLAG HOW DO YOU ARRANGE FIFTY ONE STARS
WHAT KIND OF PATTERN DOES DO WE COME UP WITH FOR THAT
COULD HAVE A CONTEST
WELL THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THEM MORE OF AN INTEREST IN WHAT GOES ON IN THIS COUNTRY
IF IF THEY HAD UH UH A A UH A PRIVILEGE OF VOTING
UH THAT WOULD GIVE THEM A VESTED INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT AND UH
I WOULD SEE THAT AS AS A POSITIVE UH THING FOR THEM TO CONSIDER
PROBABLY
UH YEAH I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE
WELL CUBA'S CLOSER BUT UH
RIGHT
THAT IS A GOOD DISTANCE
WHAT IS THEIR MAJOR INDUSTRY
IS IT UH I I BELIEVE IS IT SUGAR CANE OR I'M NOT SU- SURE EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH WITH THE THE STATE OF THEIR A- AGRICULTURE
RIGHT YOU HAVE TO QUESTION
HAVE TO WONDER HOW MUCH TILLABLE LAND THEY HAVE UH BEING AN ISLAND
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YEAH I KNOW THEY MUST HAVE A LOT OF TOURISM TOO BUT I DON'T SEE AS MUCH ADVERTISING THERE AS YOU DO IN THE BAHA- THE SAY THE BAHAMAS
WITH UH SAY UH UH SAINT THOMAS UH VIRGIN ISLANDS UH PLACES LIKE THAT
RIGHT WELL THE VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE AN AMERICAN TERRITORY
OKAY SO I GUESS UM
I START WITH MAYBE IF IF DOES DO YOU KNOW IF THE POPULATION FAVORS STATEHOOD OR
WHAT ARE WE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO WHETHER WE FAVOR IT
WELL SEE I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS BECAUSE UM IT IT THE WITH THE FINANCIAL SITUATION I DON'T REALLY QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE IF THEY WOULD BE A BURDEN TO US
OR IF THEY ALREADY ARE A BURDEN
SO I I REALLY
WHAT UH I REALLY DON'T CARE YOU KNOW I MEAN
YES THAT I THINK THAT'S TRUE SO THAT MAKES THEM FEEL DEFINITELY LIKE OUTSIDERS
BUT LIKE GETTING BACK TO THE THEIR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
THEY THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF UH TAX BENEFITS
YEAH SO UM ALSO OF COURSE THEY THEY CAN THEY JOIN THE THEY CAN ALWAYS JOIN THE MILITARY SERVICE THEY ARE CONSIDERED CITIZENS I BELIEVE
YEAH THEY CAN
YEAH THAT'S A STRANGE SITUATION YOU YOU'RE A CITIZEN YET YOU CAN'T VOTE
S- SO IF
YES I WENT I WORKED UM I WENT THERE FOR A CLASS IN A FACTORY
AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MY CLASS COULDN'T SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH THEY HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WITH IT AND THEY AND THEY COULDN'T  THE ONES THAT COULD SPEAK
SPEAK IT HAD A REALLY HARD TIME READING IT SO
YES AS WELL AS THE THE UM
THE QUEBEC PEOPLE THAT THAT SPEAK FRENCH
AND THEY'RE S-
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BILINGUAL
BUT UM
YES WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU UM DO YOU DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BECOME INDEPENDENT MAYBE OR DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD  BENEFIT
YEAH I THINK IF I WAS A MIDDLE CLASS PUERTO RICAN MAYBE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE UM STABLEST THING TO DO
THEY WOULD
YES
SO THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO EVER VOTE
WHETHER THEY WANT ONE ONE OF THE THREE CHOICES
I KNOW BECAUSE I THINK I'VE BEEN REA- I READ THIS TEN YEARS AGO THAT THEY WERE HAVING THESE BIG UH
UM RALLIES AND PEOPLE WOULD BE IN THE STREETS FLASHING SIGNS STATEHOOD YES AND OTHER PEOPLE WOULD S- DOWN THE STATEHOOD
IT'S IT DOWN THERE IF YOU'RE UM FAMILIAR WITH THEIR POLITICS
THEY UH
IT'S VERY UH I- I DON'T KNOW IT'S CALLED LATINO THERE THEY HAVE LOUDSPEAKERS ON THEIR CARS AND THEY RUN DOWN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAYING VOTE FOR YOU KNOW PIERRE HE'S OR UH PE- UH
PEDRO HE'S THE BEST I- IT'S REALLY KIND OF COMICAL
YEAH THESE THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE BIG LOUDSPEAKERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE UH
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM JUST LIKE OURS WHERE THEY ELECT THEIR MAYORS AND THEIR COUNCILMENS IT'S REALLY KIND OF FUNNY IT'S IT'S KIND OF AN INVASION OF YOUR P- PRIVACY TOO THEY'RE GOING DOWN THESE STREETS WITH THESE REALLY LOUD SPEAKERS
YEAH THERE THERE'S SOME REALLY POOR AREAS WHERE WHEN I WENT  UH
IT IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS IT WAS ALWAYS
YOU COULDN'T IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA THEY THEY DIDN'T ADVISE YOU TO GO OUT AND UH YOU KNOW GO IN THE THE UH POORER SECTIONS OF TOWN
BUT THE THE BIG CITIES WHERE THE UH BIG HOTELS WERE
THA- THAT WAS THAT WAS SAFE GROUND TO WALK AROUND BUT UH PARTICULARLY IN SAN JUAN WE WANTED TO GO WALK ON THE BEACH AT NIGHT AND THEY LOOKED AT US LIKE WE WERE CRAZY
SAYS NO YOU CAN'T GO AT NIGHT BECAUSE UH
WE WERE WE OUR BUSINESS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND WE WERE ONLY IN SAN JUAN IT WAS AT NIGHT
THEY DON'T WANT US GO OUT ON THE BEACH YOU KNOW SAID IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS
UM ACTUALLY WE UM M- MET SOME PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE NAVAL BASE DOWN THERE
AND UH THEY DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE LIVING DOWN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS VERY FOREIGN VERY DIFFERENT THE THE PEOPLE
THEY THEY DIDN'T TREAT THEM NICE THEY YOU KNOW UM SO I THINK THERE I WHAT I LEARNED FROM THEM THERE WAS A LOT OF RESENTMENT TOWARDS THE AMERICANS
SO AND IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE THEY'RE PUERTO RICAN AND WERE AMERICANS
SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO UM EMOTIONAL ABOUT ABOUT STATEHOOD YET LIKE YOU SAY IT'S
THEY CAN'T REALLY SUPPORT THEMSELVES SO
YEAH THAT'S VERY TRUE
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A GOOD ONE
YEAH BUT THE THING THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT IT THE MOST IS
THEY DON'T MAKE DECISION THEY DON'T VOTE I I THINK IF THEY VOTED TH- THAT AS YOU SAY THE UM
THEY THEY WOULD PROBABLY STAY COMMONWEALTH OR THAT WOULD BE THE BEST FOR THEM
YEAH
BUT AS YOU SAY IT'S TWO DI- TWO DIFFERENT CULTURES
I DON'T I DON'T KNOW
UM SO UH YOU LIKE I SAY I WAS READING THIS TEN YEARS AGO WHETHER THEY COULD THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS
I DON'T SEE THEM DOING ANYTHING
SO
I DON'T KNOW AND IT'S ALSO A LONG WAY AWAY
IF YOU KNOW IF IT WAS CUBA
YES CUBA'S REALLY CLOSE  BUT UH PUERTO RICA IS UH IS IT'S LIKE UH I LIVE IN VERMONT FROM VERMONT TO FLORIDA IT'S ANOTHER
ANOTHER UH WHAT FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILES ACROSS THE OCEAN
BUT UH
YEAH AND THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO IMPORT A LOT OF THEIR UM
CEREALS AND THINGS A- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND NOW WHY THEY DON'T HAVE A PROCESSING I GUESS
I- I UH THEY IT'S JUST AS EASY TO BRING THE UH CEREAL IN BOXES AS IT IS TO BRING IT IN IN YOU KNOW BULK GRAIN AND PRODUCE IT THERE
UH I REALLY DON'T KNOW UM
IT COULD BE I'M SURE THEY RELY HEAVILY ON TOURISM AND EVEN  THE ALL THE AMERICAN COMPANIES DOWN THERE WITH THEIR UH ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES AND PHARMACEUTICALS ARE BIG DOWN THERE
THAT'S ONE THING I DID NOTICE UH PHARMACEUTICALS ELECTRONICS THA- MAKES UP I MEAN ENOUGH TO BE LIKE EIGHT OR TEN PERCENT OF THEIR BUSINESS
BUT UM I REALLY DON'T KNOW AGRICULTURALLY THEY COULD HAVE SO MUCH AND THEY AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T SEEM TO UH I DON'T KNOW IF I HEARD THEY DON'T FEED THEMSELVES OR NOT I DON'T THINK THEY SUPPORT THEMSELVES
AGRICULTURALLY I FOUND THAT TO BE REALLY ODD
YOU KNOW WELL THEY SEE THEY CAN'T GROW THE GRAINS I MEAN THEY'RE IF THE I GUESS THEIR GRAINS DON'T DO WELL IN THE TROPICS
SO LIKE YOU SAY THEY GR- GROW SUGAR BEETS AND SUGAR CANE AND THAT'S ALL EXPORT
WELL YEAH THAT IS IT'S MOUNTAINOUS AND UH BUT IT
IT LOOKS FERTILE AND IT IT UM I MEAN IT RAINS ENOUGH THEY HAVE THE CLIMATE AND THE RAIN
AND IF NOT IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN TO SAINT THOMAS AND IT JUST STARTS FROM THE OCEAN UP
AND I- AND IT'S VERY IT'S LIKE ONE BIG ROCK BUT UH PUERTO RICO HAS LOTS OF UH
LOTS OF UH MOUNTAINOUS REGION AND COASTAL REGIONS
YEAH I DON'T KNOW UH I I-
THAT'S VERY TRUE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY JUST
TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT THEY YOU KNOW IT'S AN AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE TO ADVERTISE THAT MUCH BUT THAT IS AN INTERESTING POINT
BUT I I BELIEVE IT'S A VERY POPULAR VACATION DESTINATION
YEP
SO ERIC WHAT DO YOU THINK UM
THAT
YEAH
SO YOU THINK THAT THEY THAT THOSE PRODUCTS SHOULD COST MORE
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
WOW UM-HUM WELL DO THEY I MEAN UM I NEVER LIKED DOING THAT AND I- I DIDN'T UP UNTIL UH SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE POINT OF
Y- YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU NEED TO HAVE A CAR THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE AND UH
AND UH I- IT GETS EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TRYING TO DO THINGS LIKE BUY A HOUSE
REALLY I MEAN  SO WHAT CHOICE DO YOU HAVE THEN
YEAH I DID IT'S JUST THAT UH
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SOME CHANGE TAKE PLACE SO THAT THE INERTIA CAN BEGIN TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND STRIKE DOWN
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK WE HAVE
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL WE WERE WE WERE IN DEBT BEFORE THAT IT JUST WASN'T AS APPARENT
SOMEHOW WE STILL
I GUESS BELIEVED THAT THE COUNTRIES THAT WE WERE HELPING WERE WERE EVENTUALLY GOING TO PAY US BACK
AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED
UM-HUM
OH THAT'S TRUE I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY I THINK
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH IN SOME IN SOME CASES IT UH I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT IT'S INTENDED FOR IN OTHER CASES
UH AND AND THIS IS ALL BASED AND THIS IS ALL UP TO ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S IN CONTROL NOW IN SOME CASES THE THE MONEY ACTUALLY DOES FILTER DOWN TO THE TO WHERE IT'S
SUPPOSED TO GET TO AND IN OTHER CASES IT IT DOES NOT
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE BUDGET THING EITHER EXCEPT FOR THAT UM I KNOW THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BE THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY TRYING TO BE FAIR WITH TAXES AND BY MAKING IT MORE EQUAL
BUT
I CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
UM IT HAS TO BE THE SAME PERCENTAGE WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT MAKES
UM A VERY LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY THE SAME PERCENTAGE MAY AFFECT THEM THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY TIMES MORE SEVERELY THAN THE SAME PERCENTAGE
OF SOMEONE'S WELL -F IF THEY EARN A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I WOULD BEING SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE FEEL LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE FAIR TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED
TOWARD THE TOP END IF I- I CAN PUT MY YOU KNOW I THINK TO MYSELF IF I HAD THAT MUCH MONEY
I COULD AFFORD TO PAY MORE TAXES IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME A BIT
YEAH THEY USED TO HAVE AND WHAT DO THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS NOW THEY USED TO BE TAXED THIRTY PERCENT
AND I REMEMBER HEARING AN INTERVIEW WITH UH WHO WAS IT THE MAN WHO INVENTED HAWAIIAN TROPIC
YOU KNOW AND HE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT NOBODY WENT BROKE OVER PAYING THIRTY PERCENT
YOU KNOW
WELL THAT'S
THEY THEY GET WE- IT IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE LIKE SWEDEN THEY PAY A LOT IN TAXES BUT THEIR DAY CARE IS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED
WOMEN WHO WANT TO STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN ARE SUBSIDIZED TO DO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UM
HAND TO MOUTH BECAUSE IT THE GOVERNMENT THERE AND THE COUNTRY THERE HAS PLACED A VERY SIGNIFICANT VALUE ON MOTHERHOOD
UM-HUM I THINK WE COULD LEARN SOME THINGS FROM AND THE AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM YOU MAY PAY MORE IN TAXES BUT YOUR HEALTH CARE IS TAKEN CARE OF AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE CORRUPTION AND IN UH
MEDICINE THAT THAT WE HAVE HERE WITH THE THE OUTRAGEOUS CHARGES AND
HUM
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT IF WE COULD MODEL
YOU KNOW PROGRAMS AFTER THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY I MEAN THEY DID A LOT OF WORK FINDING A PROGRAM THAT WORKED AND IF WE WERE TO DO THE RESEARCH TAKE UNDER ADVISEMENT WHAT THEY HAVE
ALREADY WORKING AND ADAPT IT
THA- THAT THAT PARTICULAR DAY CARE SYSTEM UM WORKS VERY WELL AND THE CANADIAN HEALTH PLAN IS PROBABLY THE BEST ONE IN EXISTENCE TODAY
HUM
YEAH
WELL I'M M- MORE INTERESTED IN THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS THAN THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS IN TERMS OF UH BALANCING BUDGET AND SO FORTH UM
I TEND TO VIEW UM AND I- I TAKE A FAIRLY RADICAL VIEW TOWARDS ECONOMIC POLICY AND FEEL THAT
WELL IT HAS TO BE DONE SOMEWHAT ARBITRARILY AT UH ON IN SOME UH INSTANCES I THINK THAT UM GOODS SHOULD COST UM REAL TOTAL COSTS RATHER THAN JUST MANUFACTURING COSTS
AND THAT MEANS UH IF YOU OH PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT CREATES UH UH ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT SHOULD SOMEHOW BE REFLECTED IN THE PRODUCT IF YOU UH THE COST OF
FORESTRY THAT YOU CUT DOWN AND SUCH NEEDS TO BE UH REFLECTED
IN
WELL I THINK I THINK MY LONG-TERM SENSE OF OF BUDGET CONCERNS IS THAT WE'RE GOING IS
A LOT OF OTHERS GOVERNMENT'S SPENDING GOES ON GOES TOWARDS THIS UH HEALTH CARE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND A LOT OF CAUSES OF POOR HEALTH OR NEED FOR HEALTH CARE ARE
BROUGHT ABOUT BY VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS SUCH AS POLLUTION STRESS YOU KNOW WORK WORK ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS AND SO FORTH BUT GENERALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS
GOVERNMENT OR INDIVIDUALS END UP PAYING FOR THAT RATHER THAN THE UH SOME OF THE SOURCE OF NEED FOR THE HEALTH CARE
UM BUT THAT'S A VERY LONG-TERM SORT OF CONCERN
UM I DON'T I DON'T HAVE GREAT SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OTHER THAN REDUCING SPENDING AND RAISING TAXES AND NO ONE LIKES THE IDEA OF RAISING TAXES VERY MUCH AND UH
NO ONE LIKES THE IDEA OF REDUCING SPENDING VERY MUCH SO I DON'T SEE ANY REAL UH REAL IMMEDIATE HOPE I MEAN IT'S THE WHOLE QUOTA'S LIVING ON DEBT I MEAN BUT AND THEY BUY THINGS ON CREDITS CONSTANTLY
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL EXACTLY
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YES WELL I  I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO PAID CASH FOR A HOUSE THAT'S FOR SURE YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH UM I
I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME ONE MIGHT HAVE CHOICES IF ONE RADICALLY RESTRUCTURED THE SYSTEM BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY A POSSIBILITY AT THIS POINT IT HAS IT'S OWN INERTIA AND
YEAH I HOPE SO
YEAH WELL I'M I'M IN ACADEMICS AND ACTUALLY I'M IN THE JOB MARKET NOW TRYING TO GET A PROFESSORSHIP AND I'M WATCHING UH THE EDUCATION BUDGET GETTING CUT
BACK SO SEVERELY UM AT LEAST IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I AM WHERE THERE'S A VERY SEVERE BUDGET CRISIS BECAUSE OF AGRICULTURE WAS WIPED OUT LAST YEAR AND UM A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS AND UH
BECAUSE I'M I- I HAVE A LOT OF I HAVE SOME PERSONAL INVESTMENTS IN THIS UH IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTMENT
THERE IS AND I DON'T KNOW IT'S AMAZING THAT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE GONE FROM A UH A MAJOR LOANING NATION TO A MAJOR DEBT NATION
IN THE IN THE COURSE OF A DECADE UM WE ARE  A LOT HAS CHANGED MORE RADICALLY
AND
YEAH IT WAS IT'S IT'S UH SEEMS TO HAVE WORSENED CONSIDERABLY
UM-HUM UM-HUM YEAH WELL UH I CAN SEE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE WE IT SEEMS LIKE WE LOAN MONEY YOU KNOW WE MONEY WITH STRINGS ATTACHED AND IF THE GOVERNMENT CHANGES AND THE COUNTRY THAT WE LOAN THE MONEY TO
UM I CAN SEE WHY THE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS PAYING IT BACK IT'S A LOT US THAT  YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY LOAN MONEY TO TO COUNTRIES WE LOAN MONEY TO GOVERNMENTS AND IT'S TH-
AND IT'S THE GOVERNMENTS IT'S THE GOVERNMENTS SH- THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE DO YOU DON'T GO UP TO THE COUNTRY YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT OR THE CHAIR OR WHATEVER OF SOME GROUP AND YOU LOAN IT TO THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE REPRESENTING THE GOVERNMENT
AND BY EXTENSION REPRESENTING THE COUNTRY BUT WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE GONE AND YOU HAVE SOME NEW
YOU KNOW STARVING THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WITH A BRAND NEW GOVERNMENT THAT THREW THE PREVIOUS RASCALS OUT UM
THEY'RE PERSONAL INCENTIVE FOR REPAYING THAT DEBT IS UNDERSTANDABLY LOW
UM
SO IT'S A SORT OF LIKE THIS IS UH
I DON'T KNOW THERE'S IF THERE'S A METAPHOR GOING ON WHO ARE WE LOANING THE MONEY TO AND PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHO THAT MONEY IS BEING LOANED TO
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH I- I- I TEND TO GET A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT LOANS TO COUN- TO OBVIOUSLY CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS UM
THERE A NUMBER OF THEM FOR POLITICAL REASONS BECAUSE WE'RE ENEMIES OF THE NEIGHBORING GOVERNMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE GIVE THEM AN EITHER CORRUPT GOVERNMENT ANYWAY BUT IT'S HARD TO VIEW THAT SO MUCH AS A LOAN AS A BRIBE AT THAT POINT
UM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YOU COULD AFFORD TO PAY MORE TAXES
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM WELL BOY UH I MEAN I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU UM ON
THE STRESS THAT THE TAX BURDEN FOR THE UPPER CLASS HAS ACTUALLY DECREASED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS UM
YEAH IT'S IT-
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL THE US PAYS THE US PAYS LESS TAXES THAN ALMOST EVERY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY  UM
UM-HUM
YEAH THEY
THEY GET THINGS THAT THEY PAY FOR
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH I- I THINK THAT'S UM WELL I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING PERSONALLY UM
UM-HUM
WELL THEY
YEAH I THINK THE THE AMERICANS THAT I KNOW WHO ARE ARE ARE SORT OF ANTITAX A LOT OF THEM SEEM ANTITAX BECAUSE THEY'RE DISTRUSTFUL OF THE GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND THEIR MONEY WISELY
AND THE SENSE IS I CAN SPEND THE MONEY ON MYSELF IF I GAVE IT TO THE GOVERNMENT THEY WOULD JUST WASTE IT
SEEMS TO BE AN AN AN ATTITUDE I HEAR IS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU HEAR THAT ATT- YOU IF YOU GO TO SWEDEN YOU WON'T HEAR THAT AS MUCH PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL WE NEED THOSE SERVICES AND WE'RE IT MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT SO WE WILL ARE MORE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT UH
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL IT UH IT MAY NOT LAST  I HOPE IT DOES BUT IT'S UH IT'S UH SAD SITUATION PART OF THIS THIS YOU YOU HEAR THE PHRASE CREEPING SOCIALISM
WHICH IS UH UH A PROPAGANDA PHRASE USED A LOT AGAINST EXACTLY SUCH TYPES OF SPENDING PROGRAMS AND UM
YOU USUALLY SAY CREEPING SOCIALISM TO CONJURE UP FEARS OF BREAD LINES IN MOSCOW UM BUT IF YOU USE I MEAN THIS CREEPING
OKAY SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT US GETTING INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST
OH I DON'T THINK WE DID REALLY EITHER
WELL THAT'S THAT'S TRUE YEAH
THE UH TH- THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE I GOT TO AGREE WAS THE IDEA THAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO GO AND GET IT DONE RATHER THAN THAN SET UP A A LINE AND SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU CROSS THIS THIS POINT ANYMORE AND
THAT REALLY HURT THE UH THE PEOP- UH THE VIETNAM EXPERIENCE UH I GOT TO ADMIT THAT ONE
UH-HUH
WELL DO YOU THINK THAT UM BY UH GOING OVER THERE AND DOING WHAT WE DID THAT UH IT'S GOING TO GIVE US A CHANCE FOR PEACE OVER THERE
YEAH THAT KIND OF
WELL THAT'S
UM-HUM
BUT IS I MEAN IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT THAN UH THE WAY IT IS IN EVEN OUR COUNTRY I MEAN UH BACK IN THE FIFTIES AND FORTIES THE BLACKS DIDN'T LIKE THE WHITES THE WHITES DIDN'T LIKE THE BLACKS BUT WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE GET ALONG PRETTY GOOD I MEAN
ISN'T IT LOGICAL THAT JUST ANY OF TH- THAT YOU CAN SOLVE DIFFERENCES LIKE THAT
SO YOU
UM-HUM
SO YOU THINK IT COMES DOWN TO EDUCATION OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I SUPPOSE THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE
UM-HUM
NO
OH
UM-HUM
YEAH BECAUSE YEAH I GUESS THE UH YOU KIND OF THINK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS AND NOT ABOUT THE BAD
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM
RIGHT
WELL ISN'T IT ALSO THOUGH BASED ON RELIGION I MEAN ISN'T THAT A A REAL POWERFUL
UM-HUM WELL D- DON'T YOU THINK THOUGH THAT UH BECAUSE OF RELIGION IT JUST ENHANCES THE DIFFERENCES UH OF THE TRIBES AND MAKES IT SO THAT IT'S THAT MUCH HARDER TO GET ALONG
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE
WELL SINCE THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE PEACE OVER THERE DON'T YOU THINK LIKE GETTING INVOLVED AS WE HAVE
THAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED FROM NOW ON AND SO ANY WAR THAT BREAKS OUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
UM-HUM
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY DOES IT
UM-HUM
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
HUM
TRUE THEY WANT TH- THE GAS GUZZLERS YEAH
UM-HUM
DIDN'T IT THOUGH
YEAH I- I GOT TO AGREE WITH YOU THERE I THINK THAT DOES GET A LOT A LOT OF GOOD THERE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
HUM UNITED STATES RIGHT
UM-HUM
LET'S SAY I'D HAVE TO SAY OVERALL THAT THE THE WAR WAS WAS BENEFICIAL TO THE UNITED STATES WITH WITH THE CHANGE IN ATTITUDES AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW ALL THAT STUFF I MEAN IT'S
PEOPLE THINK BETTER ABOUT UH THE US NOW
AND THAT'S REALLY GOING TO I THINK EVENTUALLY COME BACK AND AND HELP WITH OVERALL BUSINESS STANDARDS I MEAN PEOPLE ARE GOING UM TAKE MORE PRIDE IN THEIR WORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP OUT OVERALL
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
THAT'S RIGHT
UM-HUM
OH YEAH HE HAD SOME EXCELLENT MILITARY PEOPLE
I- I WAS
THE PERSON I WAS IMPRESSED WITH MOST I MEAN I- I REALLY YOU KNOW COLIN POWELL AND AND GENERAL SCHWARTZKOPF THEY'RE MILITARY PEOPLE BUT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT CHENEY WAS AS MILITARY MINDED AS HE IS I MEAN
THAT'S RIGHT I WELL HE WAS WHAT UH A SENATOR FROM UTAH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE
YEAH AND SEE I DON'T KNOW THAT AND IT W- YOU KNOW I WAS REAL IMPRESSED WITH HIS HANDLING OF THIS I KNOW THAT
OH YEAH
UM-HUM
I DON'T THINK VERY MANY PEOPLE ARE
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH THERE WAS UH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THE EVEN THE UH IRAQIS THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE WISHED WE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT UH
YEAH WELL UNLESS THEY FINALLY DO TAKE CARE OF IT THEMSELVES BUT YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE ANY BETTER WITH UH YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT SHIITE MUSLIM OR UH OR THE KURDS IN POWER BUT UH YOU KNOW
WELL THAT'S TRUE TOO YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH ESPECIALLY THE COST OF THAT AN- AND UH UH THE ATTITUDES OF THE SOLDIERS I MEAN THEY'RE THERE THE- I THINK THEY COULD HANDLE IT BETTER BUT IF THEY CAME BACK AND THEN HAD TO TURN AROUND AND GO THE ATTITUDES WOULD BE JUST HORRIBLE
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE
UM-HUM
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY CHOICE
AS LONG AS WE DO IT IN A LOGICAL MANNER RATHER THAN WHAT WE DID IN VIETNAM EXCEPT JACK AROUND WITH IT
I THINK UH BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS NOW THAT BUSH HAS MADE THE MADE THE STAND IS WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO UH STICK UP FOR OUR FOREIGN POLICY IF WE DON'T THEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT EVERYBODY WELL IT'S JUST A ONE TIME SHOT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER GOING TO BE PEACE IN IN THE MIDDLE EAST
MOSTLY IT IT JUST THAT THAT REGION NEVER HAD HAD PEACE EVEN AS FAR BACK IN BIBLICAL TIMES IT'S NEVER BEEN PEACEFUL
YOU KNOW THE ARABS JUST DON'T LIKE THE JEWS AN- THE JEWS DON'T LIKE THE ARABS AND THEN HALF THE ARABS DON'T LIKE THE OTHER ARABS
NO BECAUSE YOU I- I DON'T THINK THE MIDEAST HAS THE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND I- I- I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LATER THEY'RE RATE OF LITERACY IS SO LOW THAT THEY'RE STILL THEY STILL HAVE A TROUBLE MENTALITY
W- WELL YOU DON'T FIND MANY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE STARTING WARS YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW UH BASICALLY THE MORE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO FIGHT ONE UH BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO FIGHT ONE AND FIND OUT IT'S NOT MUCH FUN I'VE SPENT UH OVER TWENTY EIGHT MONTHS IN VIETNAM SO AND I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A LOT OF FUN
UH IT'S AS YEARS GO BY IT BECOMES MORE FUN NOW THAN IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO YOU KNOW BUT UH
AND YOU FORGET SOME OF THE SMELLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW PROBABLY THE PROBABLY THE MIDDLE EAST IS IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY TRIBES MIXED UP WITH TROUBLED MENTALITY NOT ONLY THE MIDEAST BUT ALSO IN IN THE WHAT THEY CALL THE EMERGENCY AFRICAN NATIONS THE THIRD WORLD
UH  AS SOON AS ONE TRIBE GETS THE POWER THEY JUST KNOCK OFF THEY'RE OLD ANCESTRAL ENEMIES AND IT'S PRETTY YOU KNOW
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THAT WAY OVER THE MIDEAST
AND YOU HAVE THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION AND THERE HASN'T BEEN A PALESTINE OVER THERE FOR GOD SINCE YOU KNOW
TWO HUNDRED YEARS THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE CHRIST WAS BORN AND BUT BUT YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUDDENLY COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK GOING OH YES WE WANT A PALESTINE NATION BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE FOR YOU KNOW WELL OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS
BUT YOU HAVE THIS TROUBLED MENTALITY THEY ALL YOU KNOW LIKE THE KURDS OR THE SHIITE MUSLIMS OR WHATEVER BUT IT'S BASICALLY ALL ALL BASED ON THE A A TRIBAL NETWORK
OUT OF SOME DEGREE YEAH TO SOME DEGREE BUT UH RELIGION IS A FACTOR OVER THERE BUT UH I THINK THE STRONGEST FACTOR IS A TRIBE OF THE FAMILY
WELL THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WE DO Y- I MEAN YOU YOU KNOW EVERYBODY THERE'S CHRISTIANITY AND THEN YOU THEN WE HAVE SUBDIVIDED BAPTISTS AND LUTHERANS AND PROTESTANTS AND CHRISTIANS AND CATHOLICS AND STUFF IT'S BASICALLY ALL THE SAME
UH BUT BUT THE MUSLIMS ARE NOT AS LIBERAL IN THEIR INTERPRETATION OF OF THE KURAN AS WE ARE IN OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE
YOU GET THE MORE THE MORE I GUESS YOU CALL THE MORE MILITANT SECT OF THE SHIITES WHO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT A MUSLIM AND AND YOU DON'T ADH- ADHERE STRICTLY TO IT
THEN YOU'RE NOTHING AND YOU'RE JUST YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST GETTING LIP SERVICE MUCH LIKE UH THE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI
HE'S A HE'S A PRIME EXAMPLE
OH I'D I- I WILL BUT SERIOUSLY DOUBT TH- THAT YOU WILL HAVE PEACE IN THE MIDEAST AS LONG AS YOU HAVE SO MANY WAR INFECTIONS THAT ARE THEY CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON WHICH FACET OF OF UH MUSLIM THEY WANT TO FOLLOW
WELL WE ONLY WE HAVE TWO CHOICES WE CAN BE INVOLVED OR NOT INVOLVED IF WE'RE NOT INVOLVED THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE SITTING OVER HERE FREEZING IN THE DARK
UH WE PROBABLY COULD WITH ULTIMATE FUEL SUPPLIES AND UH SOME RELAXATION OF OUR OLD UH POLICIES HERE SURVIVE BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT
NO THERE'S THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY REAL YOU KNOW ALTERNATING ENERGY SIT- SITUATIONS OR OR SOURCES PLAYED OUT NOBODY WANTS TO DO IT SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE THE HARD DECISION AND WHOEVER DOES THAT WILL BE A ONE TERM PRESIDENT
YEAH
IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH TEXAS INCOME TAX WHOEVER YOU KNOW WHOEVER PUTS THAT UP IS GOING TO SERVE ONE TERM THAT'S GOING TO BE IT BECAUSE YOUR GOING TO BE GONE THEY MAY PASS THE UH STATE INCOME TAXES BUT THAT'LL BE THE LAST THING THEY PASS
NOBODY ACTUALLY WANTS TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS  HAVE TO DO IS BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS PICK SOME OF THE MODERATE UH ARABS OR
YOU KNOW MUSLIMS AS  AND UH SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE MORE UH ENCOUNTER WITH US AS FAR AS THE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUND GOES
IF YOU LOOK OVER THERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO YOU DON'T SEE ANY ARABS DRIVING UH
RACING CARS
THEY WANT MERCEDES OR CADILLACS OR LINCOLNS
YEAH SO YOU KNOW WHO'S WHO PRODUCES THOSE THE US PRODUCES THOSE AND I THINK AFTER THE WAR NO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A BUNCH OF THE ARAB NATIONS BUYING RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT HAS GOTTEN BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY OR OFF THE GROUND
YOU KNOW AND UH WE WE PRETTY MUCH PROVED OUR WORTH IN COMBAT AS IT WERE AND
WHERE DID THEY GET THE UH WHERE WHERE DOES THE EXPERTISE COME FOR FOR BRINGING A WHOLE LOT OF GROUND AND IT D- DOESN'T COME FROM RUSSIA AND IT DOESN'T COME FROM EUROPE IT C- COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES
WHO'S GOING TO PUT OUT THEIR OIL FIRES THE UNITED STATES
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY WHEN WE HAVE THE PEOPLE AND WE GO DO IT AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT IN A A PRESENCE IN THE MIDEAST FROM NOW ON
I- I- I AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT ON THAT A- AFTER AFTER ALL YOU KNOW I MEAN EVERYTHING BUSH SAID BUSH PUT DOWN A DEADLINE IF IF IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE ONE HE'D ATTACKED
AND THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT INSTEAD OF DOING LIKE JIMMY CARTER DID YOU KNOW SAY W- YOU KNOW UH UM I'M GETTING OUT OF THE OLYMPICS AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU BACK PANAMA
YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU EITHER MAKE YOUR STAND OR YOU DON'T IF YOU CAN'T BACK IT UP JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING BUSH SAID HE BACKED UP OF COURSE HE COURSE HE HAD SOME REAL GOOD HELP
YEAH IT'S LIKE  AND LIKE COLLIN POWELL AND THE REST AND UH YEAH DICK CHENEY THOSE PEOPLE WERE REAL SMART THEY'RE A LOT SMARTER THAT ANY BODY GIVES CREDIT FOR
CHENEY'S HARD CORE YOU DON'T GET TO BE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE BY BEING A WIMP
BUT HE'D SERVED IN THE MILITARY
OH YEAH THE WHOLE I MEAN THE WHOLE THING WAS DONE WELL IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW
IT WAS UH OF COURSE HE HAD TO FIGHT THAT TO BEAT MICROSCOPE ANYWAY
BUT I HESITATE TO CALL IT A WAR SINCE I MEAN IT WAS
I GUESS IT WAS I'M NOT USED TO HAVING THEM OVER IN SIX DAYS YOU KNOW REALLY JUST KIND OF GOSH WE JUST GOT STARTED GOOD I GUESS THE ISRAELIS MIGHT BE OVER IT YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAD A SEVEN DAY WAR AT ONE TIME BUT UH
ALTHOUGH I- I WISH INSTEAD OF TURNING SOUTH YOU KNOW AN- TAKING A RIGHT TURN AND GOING DOWN KUWAIT CITY I WISHED WE'D JUST TURNED LEFT AND GONE TOWARD BAGHDAD
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE BECAUSE WE'RE GO- IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT SHORTLY
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT'LL SAVE THAT IS WE WON'T GET THE CREDIT FOR OR THE BLAME FOR THE MASSACRE AN- AND THEN IF WE DO HAVE TO TO GO BACK IN IT WILL BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMEONE ASKED US TO
AND OF COURSE NOW'S THE TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE SINCE WE HAVE THE ARMY OVER THERE I'D SURE HATE TO YOU KNOW SPEND EIGHT MONTHS PULLING THEM OUT AND THEN TURN RIGHT AROUND SEND THEM BACK OVER AGAIN
OH YEAH THEY SHOULDN'T LEAVE ANYTHING IN BAGDAD TALLER THAN THREE FEET
THEY JUS- YOU KNOW JUS- JUST LEVEL THE WHOLE PLACE AND LET IT GO BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE OVER THERE AND WE'RE AND OUR PRESENCE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE FELT AND THEY'VE GOT TO BE STRONG PRESIDENTS OR PRESENCE UH IF WE DON'T THEN I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK THERE
YOU KNOW IN THE JIMMY CAR- UH CARTER ERA YOU KNOW WRINGING YOUR HANDS AND GOING TRUST ME TRUST ME
HAVE YOU HAD TO PUT ANYONE IN A NURSING HOME
UM
YEAH TWENTY FOUR HOURS

YEAH
YEAH
WELL I KNOW MY MOM FROM A UH FAMILY OF AT LEAST SIXTEEN I'VE LOST COUNT UH AND MY GRANDMOTHER JUST DIED SOMETIME LAST WELL ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
AND UH THEY WAS ALL TALKING ABOUT PULLING TOGETHER AND PAYING FOR THE UH
HOSPITAL COSTS AND STUFF AND UH YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME OF MY FAMILY THAT'S NOT EXACTLY IN THE HOMELESS LEVEL BUT YOU KNOW DARN CLOSE
AND UH THEN THERE'S OTHERS WHO IS UH-HUH LOTS BETTER OFF
AND
YOU KNOW WELL IN CALIFORNIA TOO I'VE GOT A FRIEND THAT LIVES OUT THERE AND UH SHE'S GOT A LITTLE TWO THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WITH A GARA- A DOUBLE CAR GARAGE AND IT'S COSTING HER A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH
CALIFORNIA IS HIGH
THAT'S WHAT WE KEEP SAYING
UH WELL THAT'S
NO BUT MY HUSBAND'S MOTHER WAS IN A NURSING HOME
AND SHE WAS IN THERE SHE GOT SICK
AND THEY PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T WE COULDN'T AFFORD A NURSE
T- YOU KNOW A- ALL DAY NURSE
YEAH WELL AT LEAST AS THEY TOLD US UH TWO SHIFTS
YOU KNOW THAT'S SIXTEEN HOURS BECAUSE ONE WOULD COME IN THE MORNING AND ONE WOULD BE AT NIGHT I MEAN IN THE AFTERNOON AND THEN THAT NIGHT IT WOULDN'T NEED ONE
YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE SLEEPING SO I WOULD BE HERE THEN
WELL THE NURSING HOME IS COVERED BY UH SOCIAL SECURITY SEE
AND THE NURSES AREN'T NO
SEE YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT
AND OH YEAH IF YOU PUT NURSING HOME AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING I
YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO FIND A GOOD NURSING HOME IS VERY HARD TO FIND BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DON'T CARE MOST OF THEM DON'T CARE SOME OF THEM DO CARE
THE WORK THAT YOU KNOW THE THE NURSE AIDE THAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I THINK IT'S THE NURSES' AIDE THEY DON'T PAY THEM ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM THERE
AND TO DO THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO
UH-HUH
OH YEAH IT'S GETS BAD SOME OF THEM AND THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE NURSING HOME AND HOW BAD IT IS
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME NURSING HOME THAT DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT'S NOT
WALKING YOU KNOW
AND IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW BAD THAT PERSON IS
YEAH
YOU OUGHT TO DO YOUR JOB
AND IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU CAN'T I THINK THEY SHOULD GET OUT OF IT INSTEAD OF MISTREATING THE PEOPLE
WELL
THEY ST- YEAH THAT AND THEY STEAL
UH OH YEAH I USED TO TAKE UH EVERY WEEK YOU KNOW I HAVE TO THREATEN IT WHICH IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO HAVE TO SIT THERE AND THREATEN UH PEOPLE UM THAT WORK THERE
YOU KNOW LIKE I BRING HER I BOUGHT HER A BLANKET AND I HAD THIS GIRL HAND CROCHETED HER A LAP BLANKET YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE SITS IN A WHEEL CHAIR BUT SHE CAN WALK THEY JUST SIT THEM IN WHEEL CHAIRS
AND I TOLD HER UH I CAME UP THERE THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND IT WAS GONE I SAID WHERE IS IT SHE SAID IN THE WASHER I SAID I TELL YOU WHAT WHEN I COME BACK IT BETTER BE HERE
BECAUSE THEY WENT TO THE WASHER WE DIDN'T FIND IT I SAID YOU ALL BETTER FIND IT

AND SO UH YOU KNOW THEN  I HAD TO PUT WRITE THE NAME ON THE WHOLE BEDSPREAD I'M TALKING LIKE IT'S

HUH-UH
YEAH WELL SEE TH- THIS ONE I- I IS MORE OR LESS FIRST HAND YOU KNOW SHE JUST DIED UM
WE BURIED HER FEBRUARY BUT SHE HAD BEEN IN THERE AT LEAST I KNOW F-
SEVEN YEARS EIGHT YEARS
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT HER IN THERE BUT HE CAN'T AFFORD IT
AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING YOU KNOW
BUT YOU DON'T HA- IT DEPENDS ON WHEN DIDN'T YOU YOU HAVE A CHOICE THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF WHERE THEY GO SOMETIMES
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT THE NURSING HOME AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO CHECK OUT A NURSING HOME IS TO ACTUALLY PUT THEM IN THERE AND CHECK ON THEM EVERY TIME BUT DON'T TELL THE PEOPLE
YEAH
YOU HAVE TO DO ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW SPONTANEOUS THINGS LIKE MAYBE THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OR ONE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING YOU
YOU KNOW THEY EXPECT YOU SA- LIKE ON SATURDAYS FRIDAY YOU KNOW SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND FRIDAY AND STUFF BUT NOT DURING THE WEEK
HUM-UM
IT GETS BAD IT IS NURSING HOME I THINK IS SOMETIMES I THINK SOME PEOPLE PUT THEM IN THERE AND THEN THEY JUST DIE THAT'S ABOUT WHAT IT'S FOR
AND IT'S REALLY NOT SOME PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO BE IN THERE
THAT'S RIGHT AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE A PLACE TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE NURSING HOME WITH NURSES THEY NEED TO HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM LIKE A RETIREMENT HOME
YEAH
DON'T
YEAH
AND SEE THAT WOULD BE OKAY YOU COULD HAVE SOMEBODY CHECK ON EACH ONE OF THEM EVERY DAY YOU KNOW GO BY AND SEE WHAT THEY NEED
LITTLE PLACE TO LIVE YOU KNOW EVEN JUST A LITTLE ROOM
OR WHATEVER
SOMETIMES YEAH IT DEPENDS ON THE PATIENT
AND AND I GUESS SOMETIMES THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT OF THE ROOM AND HOW THEY DONE BUILT THE HOSPITALS
BECAUSE I KNOW ONE LADY LIKE SHE HAD A ROOMMATE BUT THE WOMAN ACROSS THE HALL DIDN'T HAVE ONE
GET MY PURSE UH
BUT IT IT IT YOU KNOW IT JUST TO ME NURSING HOMES ARE UM
BAD NEWS UNLESS YOU CAN FIND A REALLY GOOD ONE
AND THOSE ARE RARE BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES AND THERE ARE SOME BAD ONES
I MEAN
I TOLD MY HUSBAND WELL IS THIS WEIRD BECAUSE SEE WHAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IS EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE NURSING HOME THEY WILL GET OLD ONE DAY
AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO TO SOMEBODY WILL COME BACK TO THEM THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL YEAH
OR MAYBE THAT WON'T NOT MAKE IT THAT FAR IN LIFE
FOR WHAT THEY DID TO SOMEBODY BUT
THAT'S THE WHOLE THAT'S WHAT I THINK I THINK GOD WILL DEFINITELY GET UH YOU KNOW UH
THERE'S TWO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW YOU SHOULD NOT MESS UH ABUSE AND THAT'S A CHILD AND A SO- PERSON THAT'S ELDERLY YOU SHOULDN'T ABUSE ANYBODY BUT BUT DOWN RIGHT
THEM PEOPLE THEM TWO PEOPLE ARE THE MOST HELPLESS PEOPLE YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING
YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T REALLY DEFEND THEMSELVES LIKE SOMEBODY GRO- UH SAY MY AGE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YEAH
BECAUSE I CAN TELL SOMEBODY TO GO LEAVE ME ALONE
BUT THEY SO OLD
YEAH
YOU CAN FORCE THEIR HAND MORE OR LESS BUT SEE SOMEBODY THAT OLD THEY DON'T KNOW
AND THEN WHAT THEY WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO AND IF THEY TELL ANYBODY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY OH THEY'RE JUST SENILE
YOU KNOW HUH-UH  AND THAT AIN'T RIGHT NEITHER
SO
IT IT IT IT GETS BAD YOU KNOW IT JUST DEPENDS ON LIKE I SAID THE NURSING HOME NOW MY GRANDMOTHER WAS IN A NURSING HOME IN CALIFORNIA
BEFORE SHE DIED BUT IT WAS A NICE NURSING HOME FOR YOU KNOW IT WAS ONE OF THE NICE ONES
BUT NOW MY MOM AND THEM HAD TO PAY FOR THAT TOO
YOU HAVE TO PAY MORE YOU KNOW SOCIAL SECURITY COVERS SO MUCH AND THEN UM YOU HAVE TO PAY SOME MORE AND SHE CHOSE TO PAY SOME MORE
IF SHE YOU KNOW SINCE IT WAS LIKE MY MY GRANDMOTHER HAD
THIRTEEN KIDS SO THEY ALL YOU KNOW PAID THEIR MONTH
WHICH WAS BETTER  BUT SEE MY HUSBAND'S A ONLY CHILD
YEAH
IF YEAH SEE AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THING SHE TOLD ME IS YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY COOPERATES BECAUSE LIKE BY HER HER BEING THERE IF SOMEONE IF IF ONE OF HER BROTHERS DIDN'T SEND IN THEIR CHECK
SHE WOULD HAVE TO PAY IT
YOU KNOW AND WAIT FOR HIM TO WHENEVER HE DECIDE TO PAY IT  YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
JUST PRETTY
OH YEAH SEE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT GETS ME LIKE WELL JUST LIKE MY BROTHER HE HAS GOT HIS FIVE BEDROOM HOUSE
IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE SWIMMING POOL AND HERE I AM RENTING A HOUSE BARELY MAKING IT
UM-HUM
YEAH
AND THEN YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE I TELL HIM YOU MAKE MORE MONEY THAN I DO THAN I COULD EVER REALLY THINK ABOUT IF I MADE AS MUCH MONEY AS MY BROTHER I WOULD BE JUST LIKE SET FOR LIFE
YOU KNOW BUT NOT HIM HE'S NEVER HAPPY AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHY HE MAKES AS MUCH AS HE DO IS BECAUSE HE KEEPS THRIVING FOR MORE
WHICH I PROBABLY IF I GOT WHAT I WANTED I'D BE OKAY

OKAY

I SEE
OKAY OKAY THAT'S INTERESTING
I GUESS REALLY THOUGH I'M A NATIVE TEXAN SO THAT REALLY THE ABOUT THE ONLY TEAM I'VE EVER UH FOLLOWED HAS BEEN THE RANGERS
AND UH UH WHAT DO YOU THINK MILWAUKEE'S GOING TO DO THIS YEAR
IS THAT RIGHT
SORT OF A BUILDING SEAS- SEASON YEAH
SHOOT THE RANGERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT THEY'LL DO THEY'LL PROBA-
UH THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE ALL STAR BREAK AND THEN UH THEN THEY'LL PERK UP A LITTLE BIT AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR UH THEIR AVERAGE PACE BUT
YEAH UH I HEARD THAT BUT I HEARD ON UH UH THE RADIO THIS MORNING THAT THAT UH
YOU KNOW OLD BOBBY VALENTINE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO NO UH TRUTH TO THAT BUT YOU NEVER CAN TELL
THAT'S RIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY I'D LIKE TO GET RID OF HIM I THINK HE'S SORT OF A SHOWBOAT AND REALLY HADN'T PRODUCED YOU KNOW A WHOLE LOT BUT UH
RIGHT
YEAH WHEN  THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND SOME MONEY AND I THINK BUILD UP THEIR PITCHING STAFF UH
YEAH IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE DOES THIS YEAR
YEAH I HEARD UH JUST I GUESS LAST NIGHT THEY GOT BEAT UH AND BOBBY WITT WAS THE PITCHER AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE UH YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR HOT GUY
AND UH SOUNDED LIKE HE GOT POUNDED PRETTY HARD
YEAH
RIGHT AND AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE RANGERS NEED SOME SOME CONSISTENCY YOU KNOW OUTER STARTER
AND UH UH I DON'T KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING
UH MY AT WORK MY BOSS GOT SEASON TICKETS THIS YEAR
SO UH HOPEFULLY IF I'M REAL NICE TO HIM HE'S GOING THROW A COUPLE OF THOSE MY WAY EVERY NOW AND THEN SO IT WILL BE FUN TO GO OUT THERE AND WATCH THEM
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID THAT UH HE REALLY WORKED OUT YOU KNOW HARD IN OFF SEASON AND UH MAYBE HE CAN CATCH A FLY BALL OR TWO THIS YEAR
RIGHT GOD HE NEED TO I MEAN HE'S GOT ALL THE TALENT IN THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES AROUND TO TO HITTING THE BASEBALL
BUT UH I MEAN YOU GOT TO BE A TOTAL PLAYER WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PROS
YEAH
YEAH UH I DON'T KNOW
IS THAT RIGHT
WELL THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO UH BECAUSE UH
RIGHT TO TO ACTUALLY BE A LEADER UH A TEAM LEADER
AND UH YOU KNOW THE RANGERS REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY STAR PLAYERS BESIDES RYAN THAT UH I THINK THE OTHER PLAYERS LOOK UP TO
BECAUSE INCAVIGLIA I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW UH HE STANDS OUT TO BE A A REAL LEADER
RIGHT RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE A YOUNG GUY THAT THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT OF WEIGHT INTO UH THAT JUAN GONZALEZ YEAH
YEAH SO IT BE INTERESTING TO SEE YOU KNOW I THINK AND MAKE HIM PROGRESS AND UH GET HIM ON BOARD
AND THEN HE'LL BECOME AN ALL STAR
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
BUT UH

I DON'T KNOW I TELL YOU WHAT THEY'VE UH THEY'VE GOT A BIG ENOUGH PAYROLL THEY NEED TO UH UH
GO BACK
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
YEAH AND I I JUST DON'T SEE UH YOU KNOW A BASEBALL PLAYER BEING WORTH THAT
OR ANY REALLY ANY PRO PRO ATHLETE BECAUSE WE LOOK AT THAT COMPARED TO WHAT UH NORMAL PEOPLE MAKE I MEAN IT'S JUST TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS
AND UH
YEAH -AT THAT THAT'S WHAT TICKS ME OFF ABOUT OLD UH HENDERSON YOU KNOW WANTING TO RENE- RENEGOTIATE HIS CONTRACT BECAUSE UH UH HE'S NOT THE HIGHEST PAID PLAYER ANYMORE
WELL MAN THAT'S THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS
RIGHT
EXACTLY AND YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THE THE CONSUMER AND THE UH FAN ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THROUGH THE
RIGHT AND THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS YOU KNOW ON TV UH BECAUSE A TV CONTRACT IS REALLY WHERE THEY RAKE IN THE MONEY AND
RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
EXACTLY AND UH
YOU KNOW SO I I DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY UH YOU KNOW I'LL PAY KEEP PAYING WHATEVER THE TICKET PRICES ARE BUT
AND UH IT REALLY DOES IRK ME TO SEE THOSE GUYS OUT THERE UH YOU KNOW MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY
AND UH AND THEN THE THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW JUST CONTINUES TO YOU KNOW HELP SUPPORT AND FUNNEL THE FUNDS INTO UH TO MAKE IT HAPPEN WHATEVER IT COSTS
RIGHT
WELL THAT'S RIGHT YOU CAN GET YOUR YOUR FILL JUST ABOUT
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
SO UH
OH REALLY
OH YEAH
OH JEEZ
GOLLY
OH MAN THAT'S RIDICULOUS
OH MAN THAT MAKES IT TOUGH ON THE THE WHOLE CLUB THE MANAGEMENT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE REST PLAYERS
YEAH
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL IT WILL BE INTERESTING
I SORT OF AM TOO UH I ENJOY GOING OUT TO A COUPLE OF THE GAMES AND AND UH
I REALLY DON'T GET THAT INVOLVED UNTIL THE PLAY-OFFS THOUGH UH
YOU KNOW THE SEASON'S JUST SO LONG
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT DEPENDING ON WHAT NIGHT IT IS AND WHERE THEY'RE AT UH ON WHOSE PLAYING
AND UH
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL I TELL YOU WHAT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND UH WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WATCH AND SEE HOW IT GOES COMES ABOUT
ALL RIGHTY W-
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER BYE-BYE
UH SOMEWHAT THEY'RE NOT MY FAVORITE TEAM BUT UH YEAH I AM UH SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THEM
I FOLLOW THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS MOSTLY
BASICALLY BE- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I CAME FROM AND UH GREW UP FOLLOWING THEM AS A KID
OKAY
WELL UH
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CHALLENGE FOR THE LEAD IN THE EAST
UH THEY THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF UH REBUILDING TO DO
THEY TRADED FOR A LOT OF NEW PLAYERS UH IN IN THE OFF SEASON AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT HELP THEM BUT UH I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A YEAR FOR PULLING TOGETHER AND LOOKING FOR THE FUTURE
YEAH UH-HUH
WELL THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRADE PETE INCAVIGLIA
OKAY
THEY MIGHT JUST BE FISHING TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR HIM
YEAH
YEAH I AGREE THEY'RE PAYING HIM TOO MUCH MONEY AND UH F- FOR THE KIND OF MONEY THEY'RE PAYING HIM RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THEY CAN GET A PRETTY GOOD QUALITY OUTFIELDER
YEAH I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING NOLAN RYAN PITCH
BUT UH
I THINK THE REST OF THE STAFF IS UH A LITTLE WEAK
RIGHT
HE'S HOT AND COLD
HE'LL HAVE AN OUTSTANDING OUTING AND THE NEXT TIME HE'LL GET SHELLED
SO
YEAH
I SEE
I GUESS RUBEN SIERRA'S GOT AN ENTIRELY NEW ATTITUDE THIS SEASON
HE CLAIMS TO BE OUT THERE TO PLAY BALL
YEAH THEY SAY HE'S REALLY BEEN HUSTLING
NEVER
YEAH
WELL I FELT A LITTLE GUILTY BUT NOT MUCH WHEN UH ROBIN YOUNT WON THE MVP INSTEAD OF SIERRA
THE OTHER YEAR
BUT UH YOUNT HAS BEEN A HE'S HE'S A PLAYER UH YEAR IN YEAR OUT AND ALWAYS UH IS LEADING THE TEAM IN UH MOST OF MOST OF THEIR OFFENSIVE CATEGORIES
HE REALLY IS A TEAM PLAYER
YEAH
SIERRA HASN'T SHOWN THAT KIND OF MATURITY YET
YEAH AND HE HASN'T REALLY SHOWN THE THE TALENT UH OR THE PROMISE THAT THEY SAW WHEN HE WAS AT OKLAHOMA STATE
JUAN GONZALEZ
YEAH HE LOOKS TO BE A A UP AND COMING UH PERFORMER
WELL GIVEN THE RANGERS' HISTORY THEY'LL PROBABLY TRADE HIM
AND THEN HE'LL
RIGHT SOMEWHERE ELSE
THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE WAY THE RANGERS OPERATE
HOW DO YOU THINK OAKLAND'S GOING TO DO
FOR WHAT THEY'RE PAYING THEY OUGHT TO GET THEY OUGHT TO GET THE PERFORMANCE OUT OF THOSE GUYS UH
CANSECO'S MAKING FIVE MILLION A YEAR
YEAH
YEAH I I AGREE
I THINK IT IS AND WHEN WHEN THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES ARE TURNING DOWN CONTRACTS THAT ARE THREE OR FOUR YEARS IN DURATION FOR THREE OR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR LOOKING FOR MORE MONEY YET
SURE
WELL IT'S IT'S A BIDDING WAR BETWEEN TEAMS AND IT'S ALSO POPULARITY CONTEST BETWEEN SPORTS TO SEE WHO CAN GET THE BIGGEST UH PAYCHECK
BECAUSE BASEBALL
THAT'S TRUE THEY KEEP RAISING THE TICKET PRICES EVERY YEAR
YEAH AND WITH WHAT THOSE GUYS GET PAID THEN THEY GO OUT UH BESIDES BASEBALL AND AND ADVERTISE PRODUCTS OR THEY THEY CHARGE TEN OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR A AUTOGRAPH
THEY'VE GOT ALL THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME COMING IN AS IF THEY AREN'T MAKING ENOUGH ALREADY AS UH STARS OF THE SPORT
YEAH
SURE YEAH I MIGHT GET TO MAYBE ONE GAME OUT OF THE YEAR UH IN PERSON UH BUT UH HAVING CABLE TV AND HSE
YEAH I'LL WATCH QUITE A FEW GAMES ON TV
ESPECIALLY TO SOMEBODY LIKE NOLAN PITCH
BREWERS ALWAYS HAVE SUCH HARD LUCK TEDDY HIGUERA IS HURT AGAIN
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PITCH AN EXHIBITION IN MEXICO AGAINST FERNANDO VALENZUELA
AND UH HE HAD A TORN ROTATOR CUP
SO HE'S OUT FOR AT LEAST UH OH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WEEKS OR MONTHS THEY SAID
BUT HE MAY NOT PITCH THIS SEASON AGAIN
BUT HE'S THE STAR OF THAT UH TEAM THEIR PITCHING STAFF AND WHEN HE SITS OUT THEY FIZZLE
THAT SEEMS TYPICAL BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR OTHER STARS UH PAUL MOLITOR'S USUALLY OUT HALF THE SEASON WITH INJURIES HIMSELF
YEAH THEY END UP JUGGLING THE LINEUP AND TRYING TO FIT UH  MORE INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS INTO THOSE ROLES AND THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE LEADERSHIP DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO CARRY A TEAM
WELL I THINK IT WILL BE FUN I'M READY FOR BASEBALL SEASON TO START
YEAH AH I AGREE WITH THAT
RIGHT WELL THE PRESEASON REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING EITHER
BECAUSE THE PLAY- THE TEAMS UH USUALLY PLAY IN SPLIT SQUADS AND THEY'RE EITHER PLAYING THEIR ROOKIES OR THEIR UH
UH
YEAH
SO ONCE THE SEASON GETS UNDERWAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT THERE TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TRYING TO WIN GAMES AND UH
I TAKE IT FROM THERE
OKAY WELL GOOD LUCK TO THE RANGERS THIS SEASON  SEE IF THEY CAN PULL ONE OUT
ALL RIGHT SURE THANKS BYE
OKAY WHAT IS YOUR UH GENERAL OPINION THEN OF OF TAXES FOR THE AMERICANS
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT YEAH UH
AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE THE TAX SITUATION IN TEXAS BECAUSE THE THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT
THEY'RE NOT EQUITABLE WITHIN THE STATE SO THEY'RE CHANGING THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE UH THE TAX BASE AND HOW THE TAXES ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE SCHOOLS WHICH WILL PROBABLY MEAN UH ANOTHER INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAXES
EITHER THAT OR UH STARTING A STATE INCOME TAX
UH-HUH
YEAH
ALMOST FULL VALUE RIGHT YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH GUESS THAT'S A POSSIBILITY
UH AS I UNDERSTAND IT MARYLAND DOES NOT HAVE ANY UH STATE INCOME TAX IS THAT RIGHT
OH OKAY SO
OKAY THEN UH ALL OF YOUR STATE INCOME TAX IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
OKAY DID YOU LIVE IN TEXAS AFTER THE UH AFTER THEY STOPPED LETTING YOU DEDUCT UH SALES TAX ON YOUR TAX RETURN
OKAY SO SO YOU COULDN'T DEDUCT STATE INCO- UH STATE SALES TAX WHEN YOU LIVED IN TEXAS
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SITUATIONS
UM-HUM
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING UH INTERESTING CONCEPT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT HOW YOU YOU YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S RIGHT I GUESS  IN A SENSE
I GUESS THE YOU KNOW THE IDEA IS THAT UH THE MORE PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN THE FAMILY THE MORE ALLOWANCES YOU NEED YOU KNOW THE MORE UH CAPABILITY YOU NEED TO UH TO
PAY FOR FOOD AND CLOTHING AND STUFF FOR THEM SO THE THEY GIVE YOU MORE ALLOWANCES MORE DEPENDENT ALLOWANCES FOR THAT
BUT UH YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM WITH THE
YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S I GUESS UH ONE THOUGHT THAT OCCURRED TO ME UH IS WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING UH NATIONAL UH MILITARY OR OR PUBLIC SERVICE DEAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
MAYBE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT COULD REPLACE SOME OF THE UH WELFARE PROGRAMS
IF UH YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT THEN WE OUGHT TO REALLY GET SOME BENEFIT DOLLAR BENEFITS OUT OF IT THAT UH TO REDUCE SPENDING IN SOME OTHER AREAS UH
YOU KNOW TO DO SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE WHAT UH WHAT THEY REFER TO AS TRANSFER PAYMENTS
BECAUSE UH THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHERE OUR REAL YOU KNOW THE REAL PROBLEM WITH GOVERNMENT IS NOT IS NOT WHAT THE NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DOING BUT WHERE IT'S SPENDING ITS MONEY IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO
TO UH
NOT DO AS WELL AS THEY CAN YOU KNOW UH NOT HAVE AS MUCH OUTPUT AND
ALL THAT YOU'RE PAYING PEOPLE NOT TO WORK AND YOU'RE PAYING PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE KIDS AND YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW MORE KIDS YOU HAVE THE MORE DEPENDENTS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE ALLOWANCES YOU GET
AND UH
THE MORE YOU HAVE THE MORE UH AID FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN YOU CAN GET AND ALL OF THESE THINGS GO INTO IT SO
BUT UH SOME KIND OF A NATIONAL SERVICE UH CONCEPT THAT MIGHT BE GEARED AROUND REDUCING THAT WOULD BE A I THINK WOULD BE A BIG STEP SO
RIGHT
RIGHT IT UH
RIGHT
YEAH RIGHT I- I THINK THAT A A BIG PART OF THE UH YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT CONCEPT OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAS BEEN UH REDISTRIBUTION OF UH OF WEALTH IN IN EFFECT
UH YOU KNOW YOU YOU TAX THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MOST AND THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING GET IT FOR NOTHING
AND UH AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY MYSELF IT UH
IT KIND OF RINGS OF YOU KNOW SOCIALISM AND
AND I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THE AMERICAN LEADERS UH SEEM TO THINK THAT THAT'S THE WAY TO GO YOU KNOW THAT
UH THERE ARE NOT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT FEEL THAT WAY THAT WITH WHAT THEY COULD GET SUPPORT FOR
OR MAKING THE AMERICAN SYSTEM WORK IN THE WAY IT'S ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO
UM
I DON'T THINK THAT I'M PAYING TOO MANY TAX YOU KNOW TOO MUCH TAX MYSELF
UH I UH AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW FEDERAL AND STATE UH THE UH THE STATE I LIVE IN HAS A FIVE PERCENT SALES TAX
UH IT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN UH TEXAS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN OUTSIDE OF TEXAS BUT UH
WHEN I MOVED TO TEXAS I WAS TOLD OH WELL THERE'S NO PERSONAL INCOME TAX WELL THEY NAIL YOU ON PROPERTY TAXES IN UH TEXAS AND THEN THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THE SCHOOLS AND THINGS
YEAH I- I FOUND IT INTERESTING UH WHEN I MOVED TO TEXAS THE FACT THAT UH THE REASON PEOPLE WANTED TO GET THEIR KIDS INTO PLANO WAS TO GO TO THE PLANO SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE MONEY THAN YOU KNOW OTHER PLACES
AND UH I JUST UM
IN THE UH LIKE HERE IN MARYLAND UH I JUST BOUGHT A UH A HOUSE FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND IT'D BE ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOWN THERE  AND UM
THE TAX BASIS IS ACTUALLY UH LESS THAN THE FULL PRICE OF THE HOUSE
SO YOU END UP PAYING PROPERTY TAXES ON WHAT THEY VALUE THE HOUSE AT I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE THE HOUSE VALUED AT PROBABLY ABOUT
NINETY OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
WHEREAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS I NOTICE THAT THEY PUT THE TAX BASIS AT AT ALMOST THE UH FULL PRICE
AND SO THERE WAS QUITE A DIFFERENCE THERE
UM I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY THEY LEVY TAXES IS A LITTLE BIT UH
CRAZY I THINK IF IF THEY UH PEOPLE AND AND I'LL USE PLANO AS AN EXAMPLE UH HOUSE PRICES IN PLANO WERE FALLING
AND SO THEY DECIDED WELL IN ORDER TO GET MORE TAX REVENUE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE UH YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAISE THE UH THE THE UH TAX PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF VALUE ON THE HOUSE
AND SAME TIME THEY WERE APPROVING NEW STARTS IN HOMES HAND OVER FIST WELL WHEN YOU START HAVING A LARGE SUPPLY OF HOMES
THEN OF COURSE THE PRICE GOES YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE IS GOING TO FALL AND THE EXISTING FAMILY HOMES WERE THE ONES THAT WERE FALLING THE NEW HOMES THEY WERE BUILDING CHEAPER AND AND ABLE TO SELL CHEAPER AND SO PEOPLE WEREN'T BUYING THE EXISTING FAMILY HOMES SO
THEY WERE SHOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT
AND YOU KNOW IF THEY JUST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WELL GEE IF WE DON'T YOU KNOW IF WE PUT A FREEZE ON NEW HOME STARTS
THAT WILL BRING THE PRICE OF HOUSES BACK UP OUR TAX BASE REVENUE WILL GO UP AND WE WON'T HAVE TO INCREASE TAXES AND MAKE IT MORE OF A BURDEN ON PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING HERE
NO NO THEY DO HAVE STATE INCOME TAX
YEAH THAT'S AND THEY UH THEY DIVIDE IT UP BY UM YOU KNOW YOU PAY A STATE INCOME TAX AND THEN FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR STATE INCOME TAX IS A COUNTY TAX WHICH IS COLLECTED BY THE STATE AND REDISTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTIES
THAT IS CORRECT
UM YES I DID I ONLY LIVED IN TEXAS IN EIGHTY SEVEN AND UM EIGHTY EIGHT AND UH PART OF EIGHTY NINE
NO
UM
IN TEXAS I WAS OH I BELIEVE THE UH T- SALES TAX WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT PERCENT
HERE IN MARYLAND IT'S ONLY FIVE UM IT WAS NICE TO HAVE THAT UH YOU KNOW DEDUCTION WHEN IT WAS AVAILABLE
UH BUT WHEN THEY REVAMPED THE YOU KNOW SUPPOSEDLY MAKING THINGS MORE FAIR UM
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS UH PRO AND CON ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD ALLOW DEDUCTIONS FOR SALES TAX OR EVEN UH
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON SALES TAX BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE PEOPLE THAT PURCHASE MORE ITEMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO PAY THE TAXES
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE BARELY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UH HOUSE PAYMENT AND BUY FOOD AREN'T GOING TO BE OUT BUYING YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE
AND THE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW HAVE THE UH DISPOSABLE INCOME THAT ARE
PROBABLY MORE ABLE TO PAY THE INCOME TAX
UH OR PAY THE SALES TAX ARE THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY YOU KNOW HAVE THE MONEY AND THEY'RE OUT THERE BUYING THE ITEMS MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW PAYING MORE OF THE BURDEN UM
THERE WA- THERE'S ANOTHER CRAZY THING THAT GETS ME IT'S LIKE THE MORE CHILDREN YOU HAVE THE LESS TAX YOU PAY
AND TO ME THAT IS COMPLETELY CRAZY AND I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN SO I MEAN YOU KNOW I UH I YOU KNOW IT IT'S KIND OF ODD WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS WITH OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME YOU'RE GETTING MORE SERVICES
YOU KNOW YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT FIVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL INSTEAD OF SOMEBODY THAT ONLY HAS ONE OR NONE AND SO YOU THEY'RE PAYING MORE INCOME TAX TO PAY FOR YOUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL IT JUST YOU KNOW DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
UM-HUM
YEAH NOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION IS ABOUT ARE WE GETTING WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR UM
FOR THE MOST PART I THINK WE ARE BUT THERE IS A LOT OF INEFFICIENCY UH BOTH ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND ON THE STATE LEVEL
AND UH HOPEFULLY WE'LL
YOU KNOW AS WE START TO GO INTO COMPUTERIZATION AND ALL THE PROCESSES MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE IT
UM I HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH UH THE TEXAS POLITICS OTHER THAN THAT DIRTY LITTLE UH GOVERNOR FIGHT
BUT I MEAN UH WE HAVE A A GOVERNOR HERE IN MARYLAND WHO'S UH PRETTY HARD NOSED AND UH HE'S YOU KNOW WE'RE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SHORT
AND EVERY TIME HE COMES UP WITH A PLAN TO CUT THE MONEY EVERYBODY STARTS SCREAMING AND YELLING
AND UH EVERY TIME HE WANTS TO CUT ONE BUDGET OR DO SOMETHING ELSE OR TRY TO DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW THEY START SCREAMING YELLING THEY WON'T LET HIM RAISE THE TAXES AND AND THEY THEY WON'T LET HIM CUT ANY PROGRAMS AND HE'S LIKE WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT ME TO DO
UM-HUM
YES
YEAH
YEAH THAT AND I THINK UH PUTTING MORE EMPHASIS ON LOCAL HANDLING OF THE PROBLEM I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT BUSH CAME OUT AND SAID IN HIS UH IN HIS ADDRESS UH TO THE NATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR
UM YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE THAT COMMUNITIES WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN
AND THAT YOU KNOW THE STATES WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITIES AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY STARTING LOOKING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
AND UH YOU KNOW ONCE YOU START UP AT THE TOP AND TRY TO GET THOSE DOLLARS ON DOWN TO THE HANDS THAT NEED THEM YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES THE MONEY STOPS AND DISAPPEARS ALONG THE WAY
AND UH MAINTENANCE AND OVERHEAD AND YOU KNOW AND AND THOSE KIND OF COSTS
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HI HOW YOU DOING
DO YOU  DO YOU HAVE UH DRUG TESTING WHERE YOU ARE
UH-HUH
UH YEAH I HAVE UH WHAT I'VE FOUND OUT OUT OF CURIOSITY WAS MY NAME HAS UH HAS COME UP TWICE AND WE'VE ONLY BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE PROGRAM SAY ABOUT A YEAR
AND UH WHEN I WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT I WAS VERY UH VERY DEFENSIVE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT THE COMPANIES OUGHT TO BE DOING
BECAUSE I FELT THAT I WAS LOSING SOMETHING OR TAKING SOMETHING AWAY FROM ME
YEAH BUT NOW UM NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING I
I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT I- I DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE LOST ANYTHING AND THAT I FEEL UH SECURE IN THAT I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY THAT WORKS
AROUND ME UM
IS IS DRUG FREE
HOW HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT WHERE Y-
UM-HUM
WELL I WAS INVOLVED IN UH IN THE IN THE INITIAL TRAINING PROGRAM BECAUSE I HAD TO GO OUT AND TEACH OR EXPLAIN TO OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT WE WERE DOING WHY WE WERE DOING IT SO I- I GUESS I HAD A LITTLE UH UH FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF
OF UH SEEING THE FILMS I HAD MORE OF EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN IN UH BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE REASONS WHY THEY WERE DOING IT THE COST THAT UH
UH THAT WE PROJECTED THAT IT THAT IT ACTUALLY COST COMPANIES BY HAVING PEOPLE UH UH BE INVOLVED WITH DRUGS
OH YEAH
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT OTH- OTHER UH THINGS LIKE PUBLIC UH SAFETY BUSES BUS DRIVERS AND AND UH AIRPLANE DRIVERS OR OR
PILOTS RATHER
YOU
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I
UM
YEAH THE THE UH I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT PUBLIC PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH THE SAFETY OF OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE DRUG TESTED I'VE I H- NEVER SAID THAT I DIDN'T WANT THAT THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD WAS
WHETHER MY COWORKER IS ON DRUGS OR NOT HAS DOES NOT HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON MY SAFE WELL-BEING
NO SO I HAD UH
RIGHT
WELL I'M SURE THAT'S STILL GOING TO HAPPEN
UM YOU KNOW I'VE GONE TO THOSE CLASSES UH UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME I'M I'M A SMOKER AND UM I- I SAW THE STATISTICS THAT CAME OUT ON
UH SMOKERS TYPICALLY HAVE MORE TIME OUT OF WORK THEY'RE UH UH MORE PRONE TO ACCIDENTS AND ALL OF THOSE OTHER THINGS AND AND UH
FOR FOR AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE I HAD NO IDEA
THAT THEY WERE DOING THAT I KNOW THAT THEY ORIGINALLY TALKING ABOUT UH HEALTH
UH-HUH
YOU'RE NOT AS ATTENTIVE
UM
UH THAT'S UH THAT'S DIFFERENT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT HOW ABOUT THE UM
THE THE SMOKING PREMIUM
OUT IN TEXAS I UNDERSTAND THEY THEY STARTED DOING THAT
JUNE JULY
YEAH THAT THEY FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT UH NOTICES WENT OUT TO ALL OF THE SITES
YEAH
WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S YOU DON'T UH HOW ABOUT UH DO YOU EA- DO YOU LIKE FRENCH FRIES
WH- WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU EVER SAY IF THEY SAID ANYBODY WHO EATS FRENCH FRIES HAS TO PAY A TEN PERCENT PREMIUM ON THEIR LIFE INSURANCE
UH THEN YOU WOULD GET UPSET IT'S IT'S UH WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE NIBBLING AT THE POPULATION PIECE BY PIECE
AND UH AND NOW THEY KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IS IS LESS THAN THE THE UH THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE THEN THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT UM
PREVENTABLE DEATH NOT YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT ISN'T ISN'T THE UH THE INSURANCE ALSO FOR FOR UH BLUE CROSS
SO THEY'RE NOT ONLY SAYING PRE- NOT PREVENTABLE DEATH THEY'RE ALSO SAYING UM
THAT YOU'LL HAVE UH LESS LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SICK IF YOU DON'T SMOKE
UH-HUH
IS HE AN OLDER PERSON
WELL THAT
THAT'S NOT TOO OLD
YEAH AND HE AND HE DOES MISS A LOT OF WORK
YEAH
YEAH
WELL
WH- WHAT DO YOU MEAN IF THEY CAN PROVE IT THERE THERE'S ALREADY
HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES IT'S IT'S UH SURE IT IS  HIGH CHOLESTEROL
S- SEE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT OR NOT IS NOT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVE THAT IT IS UNHEALTHY BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT FRENCH FRIES ARE NOT HEALTHY FOR YOU IT'S THE CA- IT'S THE CAPABILITY OF DETECTING IT
HOW DO YOU PROVE SOMEONE HAS EATEN FRENCH FRIES
UM BUT I THINK IN TIME COME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT HAPPENING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE UM WHERE THE HIGH RISK PEOPLE PAY A PREMIUM BUT THEY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PROVE IT
YEAH YEAH
UH
BUT YEAH BUT THERE ARE MORE DRINKERS THAN SMOKERS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
AND AND DRINKING IS STILL SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE WHERE SMOKING IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE TODAY AND SO THAT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE SO THAT SO THAT THEY REALLY CAN'T MAKE A A CHANGE IN IN POLICY ABOUT DRINKING UNTIL
YE- YEAH RIGHT RIGHT YEAH
SO I GUESS YOU CAN YOU CAN CLASSIFY ALCOHOL AS A DRUG SO IS A CIGARETTE IN MY OPINION UM WHERE IT'S NOT SO- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE SMOKING ARE DOING IT VOLUNTARILY I THINK THEY'RE DOING IT INVOLUNTARILY
I KNOW I AM UM I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THAT SAYS THAT THAT I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO I
WELL I- I- I DO I DO MAKE THAT STATEMENT I SAY I DO IT BECAUSE I LIKE IT BUT I CAN'T SAY I'M I'M I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I HAVE TO UH OR BE- MY DESIRE IS GREATER THAN UH
UH-HUH
START UP AGAIN
I UH I STARTED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND UH
IT WAS PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT THE THE RISKS WERE UH WERE KNOWN
OKAY NICE TALKING TO YOU
I'M IN THE ATT-
ATTLEBORO MASSACHUSETTS PLANT
YEAH
OH NO KIDDING
GOOD
YES YES WE DO RIGHT HERE AT THE AT THE VERY BUILDING THEY HAVE UH A NURSE'S OFFICE
AND UH I HAVEN'T
MY NAME HASN'T COME UP YET HOW ABOUT YOU
RIGHT
RIGHT
YES THAT'S  THE THE MAJOR ISSUE I GUESS THAT UH
I HAVE A A SIMILAR OPINION AT FIRST I
WASN'T SURE
BUT
THEN
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR THE COMPANY AS AS WELL
UH UH WE HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN OUR GROUP WHO  WRO- ONE WHO WROTE A HUGE LETTER TO THE EDITORS
SAYING THAT IT'S A VIOLATION OF MY RIGHTS AND THIS AND THAT AND THE TESTS AREN'T ACCURATE AND
BUT I THINK THEY'VE GOT THAT TESTING DOWN TO A REAL SCIENCE WHERE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RE- YOU KNOW
I'M I'M SURE YOU SAW THE VIDEO ON HOW THEY DO THE TESTING AND IT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I THINK TO UH
TO MAKE A MISTAKE
RIGHT
RIGHT
WHO WERE UH
RIGHT AND THAT AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
AND
OH OH TAKING DRUG TESTING
OH SURE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S
I FEEL THAT YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN CASES THAT I THAT I AM WILLING TO GIVE UP MY RIGHTS
TO SECURE THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING
UH WHEN THE PUBLIC WHOLE AH IS AT STAKE
THEN I'M WILLING TO GI- YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I CAN'T SPEAK FOR OTHERS BUT FOR MYSELF I'M WILLING TO SAY OKAY YOU KNOW
IF I SEE THIS IS A RIGHT TO IF TO PRIVACY I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP THAT RIGHT
BECAUSE I CAN SEE THAT IT'S UH
PUBLIC GOOD IS AT STAKE AND THE COMPANY GOOD IS AT STAKE AND
YOU KNOW IF THEY CAN GET THIS THING UNDER CONTROL YOU KNOW IT IT'S GOING TO SAVE US ALL MONEY
AS FAR AS BENEFITS AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW INSURANCE AND AND AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY
RIGHT
RIGHT YOU DON'T WORK IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S CHEMICALS OR MACHINERY OR OR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT
AND UM THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT UP HERE BUT YOU KNOW UM
I GUESS IT'S JUST THE PRODUCTIVITY
AND THE THE NUMBER OF UH UH SICK DAYS I GUESS
AND THAT THEY UH
THAT THEY ACCRUE
RIGHT WELL WELL I- I THINK THEY WOULD YOU KNOW SOMEONE ON DRUGS PROBABLY MISSES MORE WORK
AND THEN I GUESS THAT'S WHY THIS SMOKING THING CAME OUT TOO
WHEN THEY'RE DRI- AND THAT'S WHY WHY I GUESS THE CAR INSURANCE HAS NO NONSMOKER RATES OR WHATEVER AS WELL
YEAH
OH YEAH
THEY
NON-
AT LEAST DOWN HERE IN TEXAS THEY HAVE NON-
NONSMOKER THEY CALL THEM DISCOUNTS
THEY GIVE YOU IF YOU'RE A NONSMOKER I- I GUESS THERE IS SOME KIND OF STUDIES THAT SHOW
BUT IF YOU'RE SMOKING
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT AS YOU KNOW  WHEN YOU'RE LIGHTING UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW YOUR HANDS BOTH HANDS AREN'T ON THE WHEEL OR WHATEVER
THAT'S YEAH I GUESS THAT TAKES EFFECT IN UH
WHEN JUNE JULY YEAH

LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE
PREVENTABLE
DEATH IN THIS COUNTRY WAS A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR OR SO DYING WITH SMOKE RELATING SMOKING RELATED
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT  RIGHT WELL THAT'S ALL WHAT I ALWAYS FELT IF IT IF THOSE STUDIES WERE TRUE ABOUT SMOKERS HAVING HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS
AND WE DO HAVE ONE SMOKER IN OUR AREA WHO AND HE
HE SEEMS TO MISS A LOT OF WORK
BUT UM
UM FORTY
EIGHT MAYBE
YEAH FORTY FIVE FORTY EIGHT

NOT SPECIFIC CASES AND UH
I THOUGHT WELL WITH YOU KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY TRUE THEN
THEN I GUESS I AGREED WITH THE EXTRA PREMIUM
IF IT COU- I MEAN IF THEY CAN COME ALONG AND PROVE THAT FRENCH FRIES
WERE THE SAME DEAL THEN THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CHARGE FOR THAT TOO I GUESS
YEAH THAT THAT IT'S A MAJOR CAUSE OF UH EARLY
RIGHT
WELL IT DEPENDS IF THEY'RE COOKED IN
YEAH
RIGHT

I'VE SEEN ON TV WHERE THEY TAKE ANIMALS AND YOUNG CHILDREN IN FACT MY DAUGHTER IS ONE MY WIFE TOOK MY DAUGHTERS ONE YEAR WHEN THEY WERE GETTING SOME POINTS FOR SCHOOL TOOK THEM TO AN ELDERLY HOME AND AND BOY THAT REALLY PUMPS THEM UP THAT UH
IS VERY NICE TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE SAD THINGS IS WHEN YOU'RE IN AN OLDER HOME
IF YOU JUST HAVE PEOPLE YOUR OWN AGE YOU NEVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE KIDS OR ANYTHING OR ANIMALS OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM
OB- OBVIOUS YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN OR ANIMALS IN A NURSING HOME BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE THEM VISIT AND EVERYTHING
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK YOU DO GET MORE BY STIMUL- STIMULATION MY IN FACT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW JUST VISITED SHE'S JUST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE AGAIN PERFECTLY FINE

AND OUR ROUTINE HAS COME OBVIOUSLY HECTIC WITH TEENAGERS AND EVERYTHING AND SHE'S MUCH AND SO THE STIMULATION PART IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK LIKE ANY ANIMAL ANYTHING YOU JUST LAY AROUND UH THAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO DIE I THINK YOU KNOW
OH YEAH I'M AFRAID I'M A TV FLIPPER ANYTHING BAD I LIKE I LIKE TO FLIP I FLIP IT OFF BUT IT IS SAD IT'S SAD YEAH
OH YEAH

RIGHT WHEN I WAS UH YOUNGER WE I LIVED IN THE EAST I'M FROM THE EAST REALLY
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THERE SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT I KNEW THAT HAD THEIR UH PARENTS I GUESS THEY WOULD BE BUT WELL IN THEIR SEVENTY LIVING WITH THEM
AND ONE OF THEM WAS EVEN A WOMAN WHO WAS FAIRLY OLD AND I GUESS SHE SHE HAD HER OWN SEPARATE ROOM AND I THINK WHETHER IT'S MORE A CUSTOM UP THERE OR MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS YOUNGER AND IT'S JUST NOT A CUSTOM ANYMORE
TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW THE GRANDPARENTS LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE I GUESS THAT UH WELL WE ARE GETTING AWAY FROM THAT WHICH IS NOT RIGHT
OH YEAH
OH RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
OH
WELL THAT'S NICE IN A LOT OF WAYS
BUT THAT YOU WERE  YOU SAID THAT BY MISTAKE YEAH RIGHT
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT FOR ME I THINK WELL MY KIDS BETTER NOT DO THAT TO ME I DON'T WANT THAT YOU KNOW SO I- I THINK OF IT WELL HOW WOULD I WANT TO BE TREATED RATHER THAN
YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO SAY WELL YEAH LET'S LET'S PUT THESE OLD FOLKS IN A HOME BUT WHEN I THINK I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE HAVE MY LITTLE HOME I ALWAYS THREATEN MY DAUGHTERS I SAY WELL
I'M GOING TO BUILD A LITTLE HOUSE BEHIND YOURS AND THEN AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR LAWN HE SAYS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ONE OF THOSE PLACES RIGHT YEAH
THAT'S WHAT WE THAT'S THE WAY WE CALL IT WHICH IS REALLY WRONG BUT MY WIFE'S MOTHER AND THE ONE SHE'S IN SAN ANT- IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S EVERYTHING BUT THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU'VE SEEN I MEAN IT'S UH IT'S A LITTLE HO- HOTEL YOU MIGHT SAY AND
AGAIN A SWIMMING POOL AND GROUNDS

THEY DON'T HAVE KITCHENS OR ANYTHING BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE IT'S LIKE UH
ON EACH FLOOR THEY HAVE A LITTLE KITCHEN AREA WHERE YOU CAN GO DOWN AND HAVE A MAKE A MEAL YOU KNOW

AFTER SIXTY FIVE EVERY FIVE YEARS HAVE A REFRESHER COURSE AND THEN TAKE ANOTHER DRIVING IT WOULD IT WOULD SURE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD WOULD PROBABLY HELP PAY FOR SOME OF THAT YOU KNOW

STAGNANT  YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK THEY'RE REALLY NEAT UM OF COURSE I'VE SEEN THOSE REPORTS ON TV THE HORRIBLE ONES AND THAT SCARES ME
IT REALLY IS IT IT'S SAD TO THINK THAT WE WOULD DO THAT TO PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THEM ON TV WITH UH BED SORES AND
UH THEY JUST STAY IN THE SAME CLOTHES OR THE SAME SHEETS AND NOT DO LAUNDRY AND I JUST THINK HOW CAN YOU DO THAT THE- THESE PEOPLE HAVE HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES YOU KNOW TO
TO AMERICA YOU KNOW OR WHATEVER AND HERE IS HERE IS HOW WE TREAT THEM WE JUST PUT THEM IN A HOME AND LEAVE THEM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
I THINK IT'S
RIGHT I THINK IT'S NEAT I THINK UH YOU LEARN A LOT FROM THEM Y-
FROM ALL THEIR EXPERIENCES AND AND THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO SIT AROUND AND LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES
I THINK THAT'S NEAT BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD I- INSIGHTS
THAT MY FA- MY HUSBAND'S FATHER IS REALLY OLD HE HE HAD HIM LATE IN LIFE AND HE'S HE'LL BE EIGHTY THIS YEAR
AND I JUST UH HE LIVES WITH DIFFERENT
YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY HE'LL SWITCH FROM TIME TO TIME I JUST

UH WELL WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT FOR FOR MY HUSBAND'S FATHER BECAUSE HE'S
YEAH
SO HE I MEAN I DON'T THINK HE HE COULD GET HURT I JUST HOPE TO GOD HE DOESN'T EVER HURT ANYONE BUT HE HE HASN'T HAD ANY ACCIDENTS LUCKILY
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
I SAW THAT ON TWENTY TWENTY THAT
THEY UM YOU KNOW THEY'RE TESTING THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW THINKING OF DOING THAT AND I THINK THAT'D BE A GREAT IDEA BECAUSE
YOU I THINK THEY DO COME BECOME LESS AWARE AND
THEY JUST
I DON'T KNOW THEY AND THEY DON'T HEAR AS WELL FOR ONE THING AND THAT DOESN'T HELP
NO THAT'S
RIGHT
RIGHT AT LEAST THAT WAY THE BURDEN'S NOT ON THE FAMILY OF TAKING THEIR LICENSE OR THEIR CAR AWAY
IT'S ON THE STATE
THE TAXES TEND TO UH KEEP GOING UP BUT
UH I DON'T KNOW IF IT HELPS ME ANY TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND SAY WELL THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE THAT'S  THAT'S WORSE OFF IN WHAT THEY END UP PAYING
BUT UH GO AHEAD
YEAH I'M STILL STILL I'M ABLE TO SURVIVE AND
AND UH WORKING FOR A COMPANY THAT REAPS SOME BENEFITS FROM THE TAX MONEY IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE PAYING YOUR OWN SALARY I DON'T WORK DIRECTLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT UH GETTING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND
BEING IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY AS IT WERE EVEN REALIZE A LITTLE SLIM THESE DAYS IT'S STILL UH
STILL A FEELING OF YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TOTALLY WASTED DOLLARS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SOME OF IT COMING BACK YOUR WAY
UH THAT HELPS THE RATIONALE ANY BUT IT'S STILL ANGERING TO SEE THE ABUSES UH EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE UH
A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE THEY STILL THEY SOUND HUMONGOUS WHEN THEY'RE YOU KNOW YOU HEAR MILLIONS AND SOMETIMES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT AND
AND EVEN SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OVER THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT AREA IT'S STILL A PRETTY SMALL CHUNK CONSIDERING WHAT ACTUALLY FLOWS THROUGH THAT GOVERNMENT
SO BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT GET US GOING OR GET US STIRRED UP SOMETIMES
PEOPLE
DESIRE THAT THAT MONEY NOT BE SPENT WELL
NO NO TEXAS DOESN'T HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX YET THAT'S
WELL BY THE TIME THE CITY GETS INVOLVED I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEIR HAND IN IT BUT WE PAY EIGHT AND A QUARTER CENT
SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY PRETTY MUCH BUT I THINK IT'S DIVVIED UP PRETTY MUCH TOO UH THE COUNTY GETS SOME THE CITY GETS SOME AND THE STATE GETS SOME
AND IT'S IT'S QUITE A BIT I THINK SIX SOMETHING IS THE STATE AND AND UH THE REST OF THE PIE GOES ELSEWHERE
BUT WE'RE IN A PARTICULAR PART OF THE STATE THAT'S PRETTY WELL OFF SO IT'S IT'S LIKE WE GET A LOT OF THAT BACK AS FAR AS LOCAL TAXATION GOES
YEAH WE HAVE A REAL GOOD YOU KNOW POLICE DEPARTMENT AND REAL GOOD UH CITY SERVICES AND BOY THE PARKS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THERE'S A LOT OF
LOT OF MONEY SPENT ON US BUT UH THE POOR RURAL FOLKS UH BARELY CAN GET AMBULANCE SERVICE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO IT'S
IT'S A REAL MIXED BLESSING I GUESS TO
YEAH IT'D BE NICE IF YOU COULD FIND SOMEONE
OH
UNINFLUENCED BY GROUPS AND AND HONEST ENOUGH TO FIND A WAY THAT WOULD GO OVER AND THEN YOU'D HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK
YEAH YEAH
THE UH BUREAUCRACY SEEMS TO SPEND
MORE MONEY JUST TRYING TO ADMINISTER SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS THAN THE PROGRAMS ARE WORTH UH IT SEEMS UH
AN AWFUL WASTE OF TIME TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING TO FILL OUT SO MUCH PAPER JUST TO GET RID OF SO FEW DOLLARS IN SOME OF THESE CASES
SO IT MAKE
YEAH
AND SO MUCH OF THAT RED TAPE WAS WAS INITIALLY AND IS ADDED ON
TO TRY AND STOP A GIVEN ABUSE YOU KNOW YOU DISCOVER A PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND SAY WELL WE OUGHT TO RUN THIS EXTRA CHECK AND WE'LL HAVE TO FILE THESE EXTRA PAPERS TO SAY WELL YOU YOU DESERVE THIS WELFARE OR WHATEVER
AND THEY JUST KEEP TRYING TO TO
CLOSE ALL THE LOOPHOLES AND STOP THE ABUSE AND ALL THEY'RE DOING IS MAKING IT WORSE AND HAVING TO ADD MORE STAFF AND
AND UH DECREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO STOP THE ABUSE
UM-HUM
RIGHT
IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S WORTH AND THE ECONOMY HAS GONE PRETTY WELL FOR A
HUNDRED YEARS OR SO WITH THE GOVERNMENT DOING WHAT THEY DO WITH TAXES STEERING INVESTMENTS AND STEERING VIRTUALLY EVERY
DOLLAR YOU MAKE OR SPEND IT GETS UH
STEERED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BASED ON TAX BREAKS YOU GET AND YOU KNOW HOUSING HAD TAX BREAKS FOR A WHILE AND THEN THEY SLACKED OFF ON THAT FOR A WHILE AND THEN
JUST UH GENERALLY WANTING TO BE IN CONTROL OF OF WHERE EVERYTHING'S GOING FOR THE MOST PART GIVE YOU THE BEST BREAK IF YOU GO THEIR DIRECTION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE
UH GOT RID OF SOME OF THOSE CONTROLS AND JUST WENT TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY WOULD BE SIMPLER OF JUST HAVING UH YOU SPEND THIS MUCH
UH THEREFORE YOU SHOULD BE TAXED THIS MUCH UH THAT WOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE SAVING IT'S NOT A
YOU KNOW A TAX YOUR INCOME BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO REPORT IT AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF
BUT IF YOU PUT THE BURDEN ON
THE RETAILER WHO REALLY DOESN'T CARE IF YOU YOU KNOW BUY YOUR GROCERIES AND THE LIKE HE DOESN'T CARE WHO BOUGHT THE GROCERIES YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THE TAX ON IT
SO  MOST PEOPLE TEND TO SPEND WHAT THEY MAKE ANYWAY IN IN OUR IN- INCOME BRACKETS
SO YOU KNOW THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD
PRETTY MUCH SPEND THE MAJORITY OF IT AND WHAT THEY DIDN'T SAVE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GET OR WHAT THEY COU- COULD SAVE THEY WOULDN'T GET TAXED ON
YEAH BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STEER PEOPLE TOWARD
A PARTICULAR TYPE OF SAVINGS YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAY WELL YOU GET BETTER TAX BONDS IF YOU YOU KNOW
AVOID THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND IF YOU DO IT THIS WAY DO THIS AND YOU ROLL OVER YOUR IRA'S AND ALL THAT THEY
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STEER PEOPLE TOWARD RETIREMENT AND ALL THAT BUT BOY IF YOU SAVE THAT MUCH MONEY
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE THE TAXATION PROBLEM WELL YOU MIGHT
MIGHT DO ALL RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS
YEAH
THAT'S FOR SURE
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE PLUS WHAT WHAT THERE WILL BE OF IT EVEN IF IT'S THERE ISN'T QUITE ENOUGH ANYWAY SO
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HAVING TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN FOR THE MOST PART AND THEN HOPE WHAT YOU DID DIDN'T GO AWAY
YEAH THE UH
THE TAXES ARE ARE
KIND OF MESSED UP I GUESS WITH THE ABUSES AND THE THINGS WE'VE WRITTEN INTO IT BUT UH LOO- LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS YOU HAVE IN THE WORLD THERE
IT'S NOT ALL THAT PLEASANT ANYWHERE
YEAH PRETTY MUCH
WELL I HEAR ONE OF MY KIDDOS DOING SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T BE SO I'LL UH LET YOU GO AND MAY-
M- MAYBE WE'LL CATCH EACH OTHER AGAIN
I'LL TRY BYE
I THINK I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS CONVINCED THAT WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH IN TAXES
WITHOUT GETTING BACK NECESSARILY EVERYTHING WE'D LIKE TO BUT SO FAR
I DON'T THINK I'VE PAID ENOUGH TAXES TO BE TOO TOO AWFULLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT YET
YES
RIGHT
RIGHT
DO YOU ALL PAY STATE INCOME TAX
NEITHER DO WE AND AND AND I AGREE WITH THE YET PART THEY'VE JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT INTRODUCING A STATE INCOME TAX
AND RIGHT NOW WE PAY AN EXTREMELY HIGH STATE UH SALES TAX ALMOST EIGHT PERCENT
WOW
RIGHT
WELL THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE TAX SYSTEM IS THERE THERE IS SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN BETWEEN REALLY THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS
AND I- I THINK THE THINGS THAT THEY USE AS A BASIS FOR DISTRIBUTING BACK THE TAX DOLLARS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN
I KNOW THAT WOULD BE A A DEFINITE B V R M I R
I THINK A LOT A LOT OF TIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THE CLASSIC CAN'T SEE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES I- I WONDER IF IF THEY REALIZE
THE THE MAGNITUDE OF SOME OF THE RED TAPE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GETTING THEIR MONEY'S WORTH AND I- I- I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THAT THE ADDED
STEPS ARE ARE GETTING THE BENEFIT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THEM TO I THINK IT'S JUST CAUSING MOST EVERYONE ELSE MORE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET AROUND THE TAX LAWS
THEY WILL FIND A WAY
IF THEY WANT TO BADLY ENOUGH THEY'LL EITHER FIND IT THEMSELVES OR THEY'LL FIND SOMEONE TO DO IT FOR THEM
RIGHT
RIGHT
AND THAT MAKES SENSE BUT LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN IT IT SEEMS SIMPLE AND I THINK IN A WAY IT'S SO SIMPLE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE AFRAID TO TRY IT
YEAH
YEAH EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T INVEST IN NECESSARILY THE THE BEST THING YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO INVEST
YO- YOU'D STILL BE AHEAD
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING I NEED T- TO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT IS IS
UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WHAT IS THE BEST THING TO BE INVESTING IN FOR THE FUTURE
BECAUSE THAT'S A THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS HEAR THAT SOCIAL SECURITY WON'T BE AROUND BY THE TIME
WE'RE SIXTY THREE OR SIXTY FIVE AND AND NEED IT AND THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT
NO
WE STILL LOOK PRETTY GOOD DON'T WE
IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU
OKAY HAVE A GOOD EVENING
THANKS BYE-BYE
WELL HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOU USE PCS
YOU AND I BOTH
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL I HAVE AN I AN IBM PS TWO MODEL THIRTY
AND UH IT'S KIND OF IT'S GETTING KIND OF TOO SLOW FOR ME BUT MY JOB I'M AN EDP AUDITOR SO I AUDIT UH COMPUTER APPLICATIONS BOTH ON THE PC AND THE MAINFRAME LEVEL
AND I JUST USE MY PC CONSTANTLY NOT ONLY DO I DO PC TYPE THINGS LIKE UH USING LOTUS OR WORD PROCESSORS
I ALSO USE MY PC TO EMULATE A MAINFRAME TERMINAL FOR OUR IBM MAINFRAME AND ALSO TO EMULATE A DECK TERMINAL FOR OUR DECK MACHINE
SO ALL I HAVE ON MY DESK IS MY PC BUT I'M I'M GETTING NOT ONLY OUR LOCAL AREA NETWORK BUT I'M GETTING TWO SEPARATE MAINFRAME MACHINES ALSO
HUH-UH
HUH-UH
HUH-UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I'VE BECOME KIND OF THE PC GURU IN OUR AUDIT DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY FINANCIAL AUDITORS WITH AN ACCOUNTING BACK GROUND
AND THERE'S UH THREE OF US EDP AUDITORS AND ONE OF THE THREE OF US HAS AN ACCOUNTING BACKGROUND AND SO SHE'S NOT REAL PROFICIENT IN PCS AND THE OTHER
JUST HASN'T USED PCS THAT MUCH SO I ENDED UP TAKING ON THE LOAD OF MAKING SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I'M THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR OUR LOCAL AREA NETWORK AND I NEED TO KEEP THAT GOING AND
SO
I I'M I COULDN'T LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT A PC NOW I DON'T HAVE ONE AT HOME
WH- WH-
YEAH I WOU- RIGHT NOW I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE ONE AT HOME BECAUSE I WOULD WORK AT HOME
UM WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PORTABLE LAP TOP PCS AT THE OFFICE THAT I END UP BRINGING ONE OF THEM HOME A LOT
TO DO WORK AND IF I HAD A MACHINE ALREADY INSTALLED AT HOME I WOULD PROBABLY WORK JUST ABOUT EVERY NIGHT
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH JUST THE POWER I'M I'M TRYING TO UH GET AN UPGRADED MACHINE MINE IS UH JUST PUTTING ALONG AND IT'S JUST NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR ME
SO I WANT TO GET A NEW UH FOUR EIGHTY SIX CHIP BUT I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW IF MY BOSS WILL SPRING FOR IT
BUT I'M I'M I'M
I DETERMINED TO BRAKE MINE SO HE HAS TO GET ME ANOTHER ONE
YEAH
WELL THAT'S WHAT I DO WE HAD A PRINTER A A HEWLETT PACKARD READY WRITER
AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN PEOPLE SHARING THIS PRINTER BY IT WAS ATTACHED TO LIKE A CENTRAL PC AND YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR DISKETTE TO THE PC TO PRINT SOMETHING
SO THE FIRST THING WHEN I STARTED WORK AT THIS BANK WAS I SAID WELL NOW FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO ALL BE ABLE TO SHARE THIS PC WITHOUT GETTING UP
SO I TALKED MY BOSS INTO INVESTING IN A IT'S NOT A UH YEAH
A UH REAL ELABORATE LOCAL AREA NETWORK BUT WE CAN SHARE THE PRINTER
AND WE CAN UH SEND MA- UH FILES TO EACH OTHER AND WE CAN MAIL SEND MAIL MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER WHICH IS WHAT WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH IT'S WHAT WE NEED
AND THEN I TALKED THEM INTO BUYING A HP LASER JET
AND  THAT WAS A MAJOR ORDEAL TO GET HIM TO BUY IT BUT ONCE HE BOUGHT IT HE HAS BEEN SO PLEASED
IT'S IT'S FAST IT'S QUITE OH IT HAS GOOD COPY
YEAH I'VE I'VE GOT A LITTLE LITTLE UH IBM PRO PRINTER ON MY DESK BUT AND I CAN USE EITHER THE PRO PRINTER OR I'VE GOT MY PC CONFIGURED TO WHERE I CAN USE EITHER PRINTER THE ONE THAT'S ON THE NETWORK OR MY OWN
SO IF I JUST NEED SOMETHING REAL QUICK AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP AND GOING AND GETTING WHAT I PRINTED I CAN JUST PRINT IT IN MY OFFICE
YEAH
THEY HAVE GOTTEN REALLY CHEAP HEWLETT PACKARD MAKES IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY A DOT MATRIX PRINTER
BUT THE QUALITY IS ALMOST UH LASER QUALITY
AND I THINK IT'S CALLED THE DESK JET
AND THEY'RE UNDER I THINK THEY'RE UH ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS NOW
OH
HUH-UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN THAT'S ALL YOU NEED FOR LIKE FOR LIKE BULLET CHARTS AND STUFF YOU DON'T NEED THEM IN FOUR COLORS
YEAH
YEAH USE THE SNEAKER NET SYSTEM
YEAH
YEAH WE USED TO HAVE TO JUST SIT AND WAIT WHILE SOMEONE ELSE WAS USING THE PRINTER
UNTIL THEY GOT OFF THE MACHINE
THAT WAS UH I WAS AMAZED WHEN I CAME TO WORK I WORKED AT THE UH
WELL IT USED TO BE THE LARGEST BANK IN SAN ANTONIO UNTIL N C N B CAME IN AND BOUGHT UP THE RIVAL AND NOW N C N B'S GOT A LITTLE LARGER MARKET SHARE
BUT IT'S THE  IT'S THE ONLY UH
WELL IT'S PART OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANY OF THE TEN LARGEST BANKING HOLDING COMPANIES IN TEXAS IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S STILL ALIVE
SO ANY WAY I WORK IN A IN A BIG PRESTIGIOUS PLACE
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR ON MY FIRST DAY AND HERE'S THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT OF THIS THIS HUGE HOLDING COMPANY SHARING A HP RUGGED WRITER
I WAS GOING OH WAIT A MINUTE
COME ON GUYS THIS IS CRUMMY
YEAH YEAH WE'RE WE'RE PUSHING REAL HARD THOUGH WE'RE WE'RE TRYING WELL SEE THE THE ENTIRE BANK IS NOT LIKE THAT WE THE THE BANK PHILOSOPHY IS ONE OF INNOVA- INNOVATION AND LEAD THE MARKET
IT'S JUST THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT HAPPENED TO BE JUST A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES BECAUSE THE UH THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OVER AUDITS IS CHEAP
AND IT'S REAL HARD TO PRY MONEY OUT OF HIM TO TO T- DO THESE THINGS BUT I WAS I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM THAT IT WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE AND THAT OUR BOARD PRESENTATIONS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AND
SO
YEAH
YEAH
UNFORTUNATELY THE THE UH COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND AND RELATED PERIPHERALS ARE CHANGING AND IMPROVING SO RAPIDLY LIKE FOR INSTANCE WE BOUGHT A
OH CONSTANTLY
IT SEEMS LIKE UH EVERYTHING I DO HA- IS COMPUTER RELATED
AND IF IT GOES DOWN THEN WE'RE STUCK ALL DAY
AND SO I LIKE THE IBM PC PERSONALLY
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED WITH AND UH I'VE BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO IT THAT UH IT'S LI- SECOND NATURE
WHAT DO YOU USE
YES UH-HUH
OH UH-HUH
HUH-UH
UH-HUH
OH OKAY
OH OKAY
OH WE UM WE USE AN IT'S AN IBM PS TWO ALSO
AND UM
YOU KNOW EVERY NOW AND THEN THE FILE GETS SO BIG THAT YOU KNOW IT MOVES SLOWER THAN I'D LIKE
UH BUT UH UH I WE I DO MAINLY UM
GRAPHICS ON IT
AND UH
A LITTLE WITH WORD PROCESSING AND THEN L- UH LOTUS APPLICATIONS TO IT
AND UH
UH YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I JUST
I ENJOY WORKING WITH THEM
THERE'S JUST THERE'S SO MANY CAPABILITIES OUT THERE I MEAN THE THINGS YOU CAN DO ARE ENDLESS
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WE HAVE ONE AT HOME BUT I JUST DON'T FIND THE TIME THAT I CAN USE IT
I
YES UH
UH-HUH
OH TH- ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I GOT MINE WAS BEFORE I WENT ON MATERNITY LEAVE THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITHOUT ME AT WORK BECAUSE I
AM PRETTY MUCH THE UH LIKE YOU SAID THE GURU IN THE OFFICE UH WITH THE UH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND ANY TROUBLE SHOOTING THAT THERE IS
AND UM
UH SO THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO WORK THEY'RE THINKING THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A MODEM SO THAT WE COULD YOU KNOW UH AND A DECKS MACHINE SO THAT UH IN MY HOME SO THAT WE COULD MAKE IT THROUGH THIS EIGHT WEEKS OR SO
BUT UH YOU KNOW IT'S UH
THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY GREAT UH IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE COULD WE COULD BECOME TOO DEPENDENT ON THEM
AND OH
I THE UH WE USE A LOT OF FREE LANCE AND UH
THAT'S UH
PRETTY MUCH TAKES UP A LOT OF OUR DAY AS FAR AS PRODUCING TRANSPARENCIES AND THINGS
AND UM
IT UH YOU KNOW COMPARED TO WHAT THE UH THE WAY THE THINGS HAVE UPGRADED HAVE UH
REALLY  THEY'RE WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR
I'M JUST TOTALLY DRAWING A BLANK WE JUST  BUT UH THE WAY THINGS HAVE HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS WITH THE PC AND THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IS JUST GREAT IT'S REMARKABLE AS FAR AS THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO NOW AND COMPARED TO WHAT WE COULD DO YOU KNOW
BACK A FEW YEARS
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH
UM NOW THAT'S AWFUL
HUH-UH
UH-HUH
OH OKAY
UM-HUM RIGHT
HM YES
RIGHT THE QUALITY THAT YOU CAN PUT OUT OFF WITH ONE OF THOSE AS COMPARED TO ONE OF THOSE DOT MATRIX PRINTERS
YEAH
UH-HUH
UM UH WE'RE JUST TRYING TO TALK OURS INTO GETTING A LASER PRINTER
AND UH IT'S JUST SO Y- YOU KNOW WITH BUDGET RESTRAINTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S MAKES IT DIFFICULT
AND
UH-HUH
OH UH-HUH
YEAH
AND WE UH GOT A QUOTE ON SOME LASER PRINTERS THE OTHER DAY AT SIX HUNDRED
UH YEAH I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT KIND THEY WERE UH BUT UH WE UH DO A LOT OF TRANSPARENCIES
SOMETIMES THE COLOR WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO PL- UH TO PLOT OUT
SO THEY JUST WANT BLACK AND WHITE ONES AND SEE WE CAN JUST RUN THEM THROUGH THE LASER PRINTER REAL QUICK
BECAUSE IT WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE TO PRINT ONE OF THOSE OUT AND THEN RUN A THERMAL COPY OF IT
BUT UH IT UH
UH-HUH
NO UH-HUH IF IT WAS A CUSTOMER PRESENTATION THEN THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT WE WOULD WANT TO TO RAZZLE-DAZZLE UH BUT UH
IT'S UH YEAH WE WE HAVE ONE IN THE OFFICE AND IF WE WANT TO USE IT WELL IN OUR AREA IF WE WANT TO USE IT WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID YOU HAD TO HAD TO CHANGE IT UH PUT IT ON A DISK
AND CARRY IT OVER TO THERE AND SEE IF THEY'RE NOT USING THE  THE PRINTER
RIGHT  AND UH WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT
UH-HUH
I KNOW  UNDERSTAND
UH-HUH
OH UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT
SO HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO EXPECT TO STAY NUMBER ONE WHEN YOU'RE BEHIND  YOU KNOW THE TIMES IN TECHNOLOGY HERE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT WE WE FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE SOMETIMES OR HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHEN UH
WE WORK FOR A COMPUTER COMPANY AND UH
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO PRESENT THE IMAGINE THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PRESENT WITH EQUIPMENT THAT'S OUTDATED AND WHEN IT'S OBSOLETE
AND THE THE GUYS THAT THAT SOME OF THE GUYS THAT RUN THIS PLACE ARE VERY TIGHT AND IT'S LIKE WELL WHY DO WE NEED THIS CAN'T YOU DO THAT WITH YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AND AND WHEN WE TRY AND THEN THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
SO
UM-HUM
GOOD MORNING DO YOU HAVE A C- A PERSONAL COMPUTER
OH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM I HAVE ONE UH A WANG OR UM SORRY A COMPAQ PORTABLE THAT MY SON PICKED UP AT ONE POINT
UH WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION SO IT WAS VERY CHEAP IT'S A TWO EIGHTY SIX
SO IT HAS NO HARD DRIVE
UM SO THAT'S LIMITING I TEND TO USE IT TO LOG INTO THE THE MAINFRAME AT WORK
AND THEN I HAVE A A MAC THAT I USE FOR GRAPHICS AND
UM I DON'T THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE MA- A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE MAC I DON'T LIKE I DON'T LIKE THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN I HAVE AN OLD UH PLUS I DON'T LIKE THE KEYBOARD BUT I- IT'S EXTREMELY EASY TO USE
AND IT'S VERY GOOD FOR FOR GRAPHICS AND ACTUALLY I- I MEAN IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE PROGRAMS ARE EA- READILY AVAILABLE AND INEXPENSIVE SO I DID MY INCOME TAX ON IT
I HAVE UM UH IT'S NOT REALLY A BUDGET PACKAGE BUT A A FINANCIAL TRACKING PACKAGE YOU KNOW FOR MY CHECKBOOK AND STUFF LIKE THAT
RIGHT AND I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN BUY AN EXTRA SCREEN  BUT BUT IT'S SOMEHOW BECAUSE THE SCREEN COMES WITH IT IT IT ALWAYS LOOKS AWKWARD TO HAVE THE TWO SCREENS
AND I FOUND UH MY SON IS UM UH SECOND YEAR COLLEGE STUDENT AND HE IN HIGH SCHOOL HAD NO INTEREST IN THE COMPUTER AT ALL
AND SO HE WHEN TEACHERS SAID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TYPE YOUR PAPERS AT LEAST WITH A MAC HE WAS WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TYPE HIS PAPER
NOW HE DOES PLAY WITH WITH THE THE YOU KNOW IBM CLONE
BUT UM  AND HAS LEARNED QUITE A BIT ABOUT IT AND TENDS TO USE IT INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF THE MAC SO EVEN WITHOUT ANY PROPAGANDA AND STUFF HE HE SEEMS TO HAVE SWITCHED
UH NO I MEAN HE SEES IT AS A TOOL MUCH AS I DO
AND UM HE NO HE'S IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
SO HE'S BASICALLY YOU KNOW WHAT- WHATEVER THE COMPUTER CAN DO FOR YOU FINE I'LL LEARN ENOUGH TO TO MAKE IT WORK WELL FOR ME BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE A GURU
UM-HUM
RIGHT
BUT I THINK THAT IS IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE SURE YOU DID X
AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK AND AND SO YOU TELL SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS ABOUT COMPUTERS AND THEY SAY NO YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THE COMPUTER DOESN'T
RIGHT AND TALK TO THEM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
BASICALLY YOU'RE USING IT AS A WORD PROCESSOR YOU MEAN
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING
OKAY
YOU TOO BYE-BYE
YES I DO I HAVE UM UH FIFTY MEGABYTE HARD DISK ON A SO I GOT A I LITTLE YOU KNOW LOT OF ROOM FOR INFORMATION I'M A  I'M A PROGRAMMER AT WORK
SO UH BUT I- I DO ALL OF MY PROGRAMMING ON THE MAINFRAME AND I UH DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THE PC EXCEPT AT HOME
SO I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING HOW ABOUT YOU
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
OH THAT'S GREAT
DO YOU LIKE THE MAC REAL WELL
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM  I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THE MAC EXCEPT IT DOES HAVE A LIMITATION AS FAR AS THE SCREEN GOES
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S VERY TRUE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
IS HE INTERESTED IN COMPUTERS THEN DID THIS GIVE HIM AN INTEREST IN IT OTHER THAN YOU KNOW USING IT MORE AS OR LESS LIKE A WOR- A WORD PROCESSING MACHINE HE
AS A TOOL UM-HUM OKAY
OH THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING TOO
UH-HUH I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN I MEAN EITHER YOU LIKE THEM OR YOU DON'T I THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF THEM
UH ARE INTIMIDATED BY THEM I GUESS MORE THAN ANYTHING UNTIL THEY GET GET TO UH LEARN WHAT THEY CAN DO AND AND HOW IT CAN WORK
SO
UH-HUH
SO ANYWAY I GUESS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE A HUMOR TOO
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM
SO UM-HUM YELL AT THEM AND LIKE TO CHOKE THEM SO MANY TIMES I WANNA CHOKE MINE SAY YOU'RE NOT DOING WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
BUT UH I- I HAVE ONE MAINLY I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I'M IN UH TAKING A LOT OF COURSES ALONG WITH WORK AND
RIGHT EXACTLY AND IT SEEMS A SHAME TO HAVE ALL THAT EQUIPMENT BUT UH NOT DO ANYTHING WITH IT BUT ONE DAY I HOPE TO DO MORE
I KNOW THERE MUST BE SOMETHING MORE I CAN DO WITH IT
IDEAS BUT PUTTING THEM INTO WORK IS ANOTHER STORY
SO
ANYWAY
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CALLING OKAY HAVE A GOOD DAY BYE-BYE

UH-HUH
RIGHT
MY HUSBAND LIKES UH SANDY PATTY SONGS HE LIKES TO SING THOSE IN CHURCH HE'D BUY ALL THE SOUND TRACKS HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON IT IF HE HAD THE MONEY TO

UH-HUH
HUH
RIGHT YEAH HAVE SOMETHING TO REBEL AGAINST
YEAH THAT'S GOOD YEAH VARIETY IS GOOD
WELL I GUESS THAT COVERS IT IT WAS REAL GOOD TALKING TO YOU
UM WELL THANKS UM BYE
WELL I PRIMARILY LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC WHEN I HAVE MY DRUTHERS PARTLY BECAUSE I FIND IT MORE SOOTHING I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC SO FAR AS UH ANY BACKGROUND IN MUSIC BUT IT'S THE  THE MUSIC I ENJOY THE MOST HOW ABOUT YOU
RIGHT
UH-HUH
I TEND TO LISTEN TO THE CLASSICAL MUSIC UH ON THE RADIO A LOT THERE'S UH ONE PARTICULAR WELL THERE SEVERAL STATIONS IN THIS AREA THAT PLAY UH CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL THE TIME BUT THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT
IS ON BOTH AM AND FM SO I CAN LISTEN TO IT WITHOUT UH WORRYING IT'S CUTE THOUGH BECAUSE MY CHILDREN WHEN THEY GET IN THE CAR AND I HAVE UH THE BUTTON PUSHED FOR THAT THEY ALWAYS SWITCH IT TO SOMETHING ELSE
BECAUSE NATURALLY THAT ISN'T THEIR TASTE
AT THIS POINT IN TIME ANYWAY
ARE ARE YOU INVOLVED IN MUSIC
WELL MY WHOLE FAMILY UH IS SOMEWHAT MUSICAL UM AND NOT FROM TRAINING BUT JUST BECAUSE WE SING IN OUR CHOIR AND
MY DAUGHTER'S QUITE INVOLVED AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING SO UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS MAYBE SHE'LL GET INVOLVED IN CLASSICAL MUSIC TOO BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU UNLESS YOU GET INTO ROCK WHICH ISN'T HER VOICE STYLE SO
NO I WELL MOST OF IT IS NOT ALL THAT EXCITING IN THAT IT IS TERRIBLY REPETITIOUS
IT'S LOUD AND REPETITIOUS WITHOUT HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF MEANING NOW I DO LIKE FOLK SONG UM AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NICE FOLK SONGS OVER THE YEARS THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF STILL HANG AROUND
BUT UM BUT THE MORE POPULAR MUSIC I DON'T CARE FOR USUALLY
UM EVEN WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC OF THAT PERIOD SO MUCH BECAUSE I FOUND I LIKED UM A LITTLE BIT MORE MELODIOUS MUSIC THAN WHAT WAS OFTEN THE POPULAR
ROCK AND ROLL KIND OF THING
ALTHOUGH NOW I KIND OF ENJOY HEARING THE ROCK AND ROLL I GUESS IT MAKES ME THINK I'M YOUNG AGAIN
ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH IT'S FUNNY IN FACT IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT SO MANY OF THE SONGS NOW I GREW UP
IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES AND SO MUCH OF THE MUSIC THAT WAS POPULAR AT THAT TIME HAS COME BACK
AND YOU YOU DON'T HEAR EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME BUT YOU HEAR MUCH OF THE SAME MUSIC PERHAPS A NEW VERSION OF IT BUT IT'S THE SAME STUFF
UM WHICH IS ALWAYS KIND OF FUNNY UM AND I REMEMBER MY OLDER SISTER I HAVE A SISTER WHO'S SIXTEEN YEARS OLDER AND AT THE TIME THAT I WAS
A TEENAGER LATE TEENAGER I GUESS I CAN'T REMEMBER THE YEAR SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES BECAME POPULAR I THINK IT WAS DONE BY MAYBE THE PLATTERS OR SOMETHING
THEN AND SHE LAUGHED AND SHE SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER THAT HAD BEEN YOU KNOW SOME YEARS BEFORE SHE SAID THAT WAS A A VERSION OF YOU KNOW A SONG THEN AND SHE SAID IT'S VERY SIMILAR BUT THEY'VE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT SHE SAID I LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION BETTER
WELL THEY DID IT AGAIN ABOUT
RIGHT RIGHT IT DOES INDEED
UH-HUH
YES NOW THAT THERE THERE'S SOME WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN MUSIC WHEN YOU CAN FIND GOOD STATIONS UH THE PRO- PROBLEM THAT I FOUND UM IN THIS AREA IS THAT THE
THERE THERE IS INCONSISTENCY IN THE QUALITY
HERE IF YOU GET SOMEONE WHO'S VERY GOOD AT SELECTING IT'S OKAY BUT SOMETIMES THEY KIND OF GET ON A A A BINGE AND THEY THEY PLAY THE SAME SORT OF THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITHOUT REALLY NECESSARILY QUALITY
YOU KNOW UH I LIVE IN THE UH WASHINGTON DC AREA ROCKVILLE MARYLAND
YEAH  AND IT
UH-HUH AND I I YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH AVAILABLE THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO THAT BUT UM
NOW MY CHILDREN HAVE HAVE SOMETIMES UM WELL THEY'VE GONE TO A FEW OF THE CONCERTS AND SO ON OF CHRISTIAN MUSICIANS THAT COME FOR OUR YOUTH GROUP AT OUR CHURCH AND UM AND
THE- WHEN THEY BUY A TAPE OR SOMETHING SOMETIMES THAT'S FUN BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING I'VE NOT ALWAYS HEARD AND YOU KNOW I ENJOY THAT
OH WOW
YEAH THAT'S NICE SO IS YOUR HUSBAND A SINGER
RIGHT YEAH
WELL THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO
THAT'S NICE UH WELL DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN
WELL WONDERFUL THAT'LL BE A MUSICIAN
OH THERE'S SOME WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN UH CHILDREN'S TAPES
YOU CAN UH YOU CAN GET AND I KNOW WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER UM WE FOUND A LOT OF REALLY NICE TAPES THAT THEY THAT THEY LIKED UM THERE WAS AN AGAPE MUSIC GROUP AND UM
I SOME OF THE SONGS I STILL FIND GOING OVER IN MY HEAD OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WERE REALLY UM
VERY MEMORABLE EVEN THOUGH MY CHILDREN ARE NOW MY YOUNGEST IS ALMOST SIXTEEN BUT I STILL FIND SOME OF THE SAME TAPES I UH SOME OF THE SAME SONGS FROM THOSE TAPES I ENJOY
UM THERE'S ONE THAT'S UM A LITTLE GIRL SINGING PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
AND UH SHE'S PLAYING THE PIANO AND SO SHE SHE GETS THE WRONG NOTE EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT THEN SHE KEEPS REPEATING IT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND THEN YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT THAT SO FAR AS CHRISTIAN LIFE TOO AND IT'S REALLY CUTE
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH WELL DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED CLASSICAL MUSIC
UH OR CLASSICAL STYLE IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLASSICAL AS YOU KNOW THE OFFICIAL UH WORD MIGHT GO BUT UM
EVEN WHEN I WAS PREGNANT OF COURSE I LISTENED TO THAT AND WHEN OUR FIRST CHILD WAS YOU KNOW AN INFANT UM OF COURSE I  WHEN I WAS AROUND THE HOUSE I PLAYED THAT MUSIC TOO
WHEN HE FIRST MADE SOUNDS THAT YOU COULD DETECT THEY WERE IN THE SCALE THE MUSIC SCALE
SOMEONE ELSE NOTICED IT AND I SAID WELL I GUESS THAT'S TRUE AND IT WAS SOMEWHAT MELODIOUS IN OTHER WORDS IT WASN'T JUST YOU KNOW IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
RIGHT RIGHT I DO THINK THERE IS PROBABLY AN INFLUENCE THERE BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT EVEN THOUGH POPULAR MUSIC
THE THE WILDER STUFF WAS AROUND WHEN MY UH OLDER CHILDREN WERE WERE YOU KNOW ADOLESCENTS EARLY ADOLESCENTS WHEN THEY FIRST START LISTENING TO MUSIC ON THEIR OWN THEY FIRST GET ASK FOR A RADIO OF THEIR OWN AND SO ON UM
THIS SAME CHILD UM REALLY LISTENED T- TO MORE UM BALLADY OR UM
PLEASANT SORT OF SONGS RATHER THAN AND EVEN CLASSICAL RATHER THAN THE UH REAL HARD ROCK STUFF THAT SO MANY OTHER KIDS LISTEN TO
AND I I NEVER I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY TOO MUCH FOR FEAR HE WOULD THINK IT WAS WRONG AND WOULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE
RIGHT  BUT UH BUT I MUST SAY THEY ALL KIND OF LIKE A VARIETY OF MUSIC WHICH IS NICE I LIKE THAT
YEAH
WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE BABY
BYE-BYE
WHERE DO YOU GET MOST OF YOUR NEWS
WHERE WHERE ARE YOU OH YEAH
NO I'M IN SAN ANTONIO
UM-HUM I GET MY NEWS FROM A COMBINATION OF SOURCES I TAKE THE THE PAPER EVERYDAY AND I READ IT ON THE WAY IN TO WORK ON THE IN A CARPOOL UH-HUH AND UH
AND I WATCH THE UH ACTUALLY I WATCH THE MORNING NEWS BEFORE I LEAVE FOR WORK AND THEN YOU KNOW USUALLY OVER LUNCH THERE'LL BE A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION ON SOMETHING FROM THE NEWS
UM-HUM
OH  YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH UM ONE OF THE WOMEN THAT I WORK WITH HER HUSBAND IS IRANIAN
SO HERE LATELY WITH ALL THE MIDDLE EASTERN NEWS WE'VE HAD SOME VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS OVER LUNCH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL I I UH I LIKE THE PRINT NEWS MUCH BETTER THAN THE TELEVISION NEWS BECAUSE TELEVISION NEWS TENDS TO SENSATIONALIZE
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MACNEIL LEHRER PROBABLY DOESN'T
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
THEY DON'T REPORT ON EVERY MURDER AND SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN IN EVERY LITTLE TOWN
YEAH
I'VE BEEN GETTING A KICK OUT OF THOSE LATELY
ALTHOUGH UM
I'M I'M ONLY TWENTY FIVE SO I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN THROUGH A PERIOD OF WAR AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN THE MILITARY AND I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IN UH
MILITARY STRATEGY AND AND WEAPONRY AND AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND I THOUGHT THE GENERALS WERE VERY INTERESTING NOW WHEN THEY STARTED TO SPECULATE I
I SAW THAT FOR WHAT IT WAS AND THOUGHT ALL OF THESE GUYS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE- THEY WERE INTERESTING AND AND THEY SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR ME
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THE BEST UH TELEVISION NEWS SHOWS THAT I SAW DURING THE WAR WAS A SHOW ON A SATURDAY MORNING ON ABC AND IT WAS FOR CHILDREN AND IT WAS HOSTED BY PETER JENNINGS
AND IT WAS SO INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY WERE RELATING THE WAR TO THESE CHILDREN IN THEIR STUDIO AND THEY ALSO HAD CHILDREN CALLING IN LIVE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND ASKING QUESTIONS
AND THEY THEY HAD ALL THEIR CORRESPONDENTS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ISRAEL AND AND ALL THEY HAD THEM ALL UH
ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D CALL IT OTHER THAN ON LINE THEY HAD THEM ALL ON HOLD AND IF A CHILD ASKED A QUESTION THAT THE PERSON IN JERUSALEM COULD BEST ANSWER THEY WOULD CUT TO THAT PERSON AND THAT PERSON WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION IT WAS JUST VERY
INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING  AND UH I WAS REAL IMPRESSED AT HOW ABC HANDLED UH
TRANSLATING THE WAR FOR CHILDREN
UM-HUM
AND OUR LOCAL HEB STORES HERE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HEB STATEWIDE OR WHATEVER BUT THEY HAVE VIDEOS
THAT UH I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL HAVE THEM BUT THEY WERE FREE RENTAL VIDEOS THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WAR
UH IT WAS IT WAS
RIGHT IT WAS SOMETHING FOR CHILDREN
THAT THAT THEY THEY HAD SEVERAL ADVERTISEMENTS ON TELEVISION PUSHING PARENTS GOING AND AND UH GETTING THE VIDEO AND WATCHING IT WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND DISCUSSING IT AND THAT KIND OF THING
WELL
BACK DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT THAT NO ONE WILL WILL HAVE THE GUTS ENOUGH TO CALL A REAL WAR UH
THE THAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY JUST WASN'T AT PEOPLE'S DISPOSAL
SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN A WAR THAT'S BEEN SO THOROUGHLY
COVERED BY THE NEWS
YEAH I TELL YOU WHAT THE FIRST THREE DAYS I WAS GLUED TO THE TELEVISION
AND I HAD
YEAH
I TELL YOU WHAT THE THE UH WAR START- LET'S SEE WAS IT A WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY MUST HAVE BEEN THURSDAY
UM AND FRIDAY NIGHT I WAS I STAYED UP UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SITTING RIGHT DEAD CENTER IN FRONT OF MY TELEVISION JUST WATCHING PRACTICALLY WITH MY MOUTH HANGING OPEN
BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING CNN AND THEY WOULD THEY WOULD SWITCH BACK TO THE ONE OF THEIR ISRAEL BUREAUS AND THE PEOPLE WOULD BE STANDING THERE IN GAS MASKS AND YOU'D BE HEARING THE SIRENS AND IT WAS JUST I WAS AMAZED
OH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
NO THERE ARE TWO AND THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE
UH THE ONE THAT I PICKED IS MORE SIMILAR IN FORMAT TO THE NEWSPAPER I GREW UP NEAR HOUSTON AND THERE ARE TWO MAJOR NEWSPAPERS THERE THAT RUN PRETTY MUCH NECK AND NECK
AND THE ONE I PICKED HERE HAD THE SAME FORMAT AS THE ONE THAT MY PARENTS TOOK AS I WAS GROWING UP I MEAN THE SAME TYPE OF TYPEFACE ON THE HEADLINE AND THAT KIND OF STUFF I MEAN IT- IT'S
PIDDLEY STUFF TO PICK A NEWSPAPER OVER AND I ENJOY THE COMICS ARE BETTER IN THIS NEWSPAPER LIKE THIS NEWSPAPER HAS THE FAR SIDE AND SOME OTHER COMICS THAT I ENJOY AND THE OTHER ONE HAS SOME WEIRD ONES THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SO
YEAH
AND MY FI-
MY FIANCEE TAKES PROBABLY SIX SUNDAY PAPERS HE TAKES BOTH SAN ANTONIO PAPERS AN AUSTIN PAPER BOTH HOUSTON PAPERS I GUESS HE TAKES SEVEN THE SAN MARCOS PAPER AND THE NEW BRAUNSFEL PAPER
BUT HE'S A FOOTBALL COACH AT SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY SO HE'S GETTING ALL THE SPORTS SECTIONS
AND SO YOU KNOW HE HAS THESE STACKS OF SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS THAT GO UNREAD UNLESS
I WATCH THE MACNEIL LEHRER NEWS HOUR AND I SUBSCRIBE TO THE PAPER ON THE WEEKENDS
I'M IN DALLAS
ARE YOU IN DALLAS ALSO
OH REALLY OKAY
UM-HUM
OH REALLY
UM-HUM
I NORMALLY FIND THAT UH I- I'M PROBABLY THE MOST UM NEWS HUNGRY OF MY FRIENDS SO I DON'T WE DON'T NORMALLY TALK ABOUT THE NEWS AT LUNCH
I I FIND THAT I HAVE TO ONLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE PAPER ON THE WEEKEND SIMPLY BECAUSE I USED TO GET IT DURING THE WEEK
BUT UM I WOULD ALWAYS END UP ARRIVING AT WORK LATE BECAUSE I WOULD ALWAYS END UP SKIMMING THE HEADLINES SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME READING IT IN THE MORNING
SO I HAVE TO CUT MYSELF DOWN TO THE WEEKEND PLUS AFTER WORK UM THE MACNEIL LEHRER NEWS HOUR IS ON UH PUBLIC TELEVISION AND I ENJOY THAT QUITE A BIT
UM-HUM
I WILL ADMIT I WORK WITH UH SOMEONE WHO'S IRANIAN
AND HE DEFINITELY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT SLANT ON THE NEWS HE'S VERY VERY SKEPTICAL OF THE NEWS MEDIA AND I WILL ADMIT I'M REASONABLY SKEPTICAL ALSO
BUT HE'S I DON'T KNOW UH HE'S
MU- MUCH MUCH MORE SO IT'S IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING THOUGH BECAUSE HE DOES BRING A A MUCH UM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WITH ALL THE GULF GOINGS ON UM
HE WAS ALWAYS SPEAKING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW AMERICAN IMPERIALISM REASSERTING ITSELF AND I SUPPOSE IT'S A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE THAT WE NORMALLY DON'T HEAR IN THE COUNTRY
UM-HUM
TRUE UM THE
THEY UM TEND TO SPEND
QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON ONE STORY THEY WILL HAVE MAYBE TWO OR THREE MAIN STORIES AND JUST SPEND A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME SORT OF LIKE THE UH WHAT IS THAT ABC'S NIGHTLINE
UH WELL I GUESS THEY ONLY NORMALLY STICK WITH JUST THE ONE UM STORY BUT THEY THEY CAN DO A MUCH BETTER JOB SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHOP IT INTO LITTLE TWO MINUTE STORIES
NO NO IT'S VERY MUCH NATIONAL INTEREST NEWS A LOT OF TIMES THEY END UP UM
WITH THESE PANELS OF EXPERTS AND THEY GO BACK AND FORTH WHERE EVERYONE'S GIVING SOME OPINIONS AND SOMETIMES THAT I I DON'T KNOW THE VALUE OF THAT BECAUSE UM I SAW PLENTY OF JOKES AND AND UM
OH EDITORIAL CARTOONS ABOUT ALL THE RETIRED GENERALS MAKING THEIR LIVING DURING THE THE GULF WAR
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I WILL ADMIT IT'S INTERESTING I I I'M TWENTY SIX SO I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE EXPERIENCE IN THAT THAN YOU UM
IT IT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THAT IT SEEMED LIKE SOME OF THE COMMENTATORS HAD THEIR AXE TO GRIND YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE SCREAMING FOR AIR POWER THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE SAYING THE AIR POWER WASN'T GOING TO DO IT AND THEY SEEMED TO MOLD THE EVENTS
TO THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH I SUPPOSE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE DOES BUT THESE GUYS HAD A A UH NATIONAL SOAP BOX TO STAND ON AND AND EXPRESS THIS VIEW
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH I I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT ALTHOUGH I DID UH I GUESS ONE THING THAT I FOUND SORT OF INTERESTING THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE OFF THE TOPIC BUT
THERE THERE IS A A BIG PUSH YOU KN- WITH THE LOCAL  T V STATIONS TO HAVE LITTLE HOT LINES WITH UM COUNSELORS
TO TO HELP PARENTS UH LEARN HOW TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WAR WITH THEIR CHILDREN I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY UNUSUAL THING
UM-HUM
I- IT WITH THE CHILDREN'S ASPECT UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I SUPPOSE THAT IS A VALUABLE SERVICE THAT AGAIN NOT HAVING UH LIVED THROUGH ANOTHER WAR I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A COMMON THING THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF OR IF THAT WAS
A A NEW CONCERN WITH PEOPLE
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
AND PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY ONE THAT LASTED SHORT ENOUGH THAT THAT PEOPLE'S INTEREST DIDN'T FLAUGE TOO BADLY
I WILL ADMIT THE SAME THING I WOULD COME HOME AND FLIP ON MACNEIL LEHRER AND THEY WOULD RUN THESE EXTENDED TWO THREE HOUR VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM AND I I WAS JUST I WAS
HORRIFIED AND FASCINATED BY WHAT I WAS SEEING
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I I DIDN'T HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE I I DON'T HAVE CABLE SO I I'M PRETTY MUCH LIMITED TO PBS WHICH I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB
UM I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU I
YOU SAY YOU TAKE THE NEWSPAPER
UM
I I FOUND THE NEWSPAPER SITUATION IN DALLAS VERY INTERESTING WE'VE GOT
THE ONE FAIRLY WELL RELATIVELY WEAKER PAPER THE TIMES HERALD AND THEN THE MORNING NEWS WHICH HAS A VERY STRONG SUBSCRIPTION
DOES SAN ANTONIO HA- YOU SAID SAN ANTONIO RIGHT
DO YOU HAVE JUST ONE PAPER OR DO YOU HAVE SEVERAL
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I I ACTUALLY TAKE BOTH NEWSPAPERS ON THE WEEKENDS I FIGURE I'M ONLY TAKING ON THE WEEKEND AND I CAN AFFORD THAT I I FIND THE NEWS REPORTING IN THE THE
MOURNING NEWS TO BE BETTER BUT I I SORT OF HAVE A LIBERAL POLITICAL SLANT AND THE MOURNING NEWS JUST HAS AN INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE EDITORIAL UM OUTLOOK
STILL I I GET THE TIMES HERALD JUST TO BALANCE THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT
UM-HUM
HAVE YOU HAD ANY UH MAJOR UH CAR REPAIRS DONE RECENTLY
UH-HUH
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD HAVE COST MORE THAN THE CAR WAS WORTH
I THINK ANY CAR THAT RUNS RIGHT NOW IS IN DEMAND
UH I WORK ON MY OWN I'VE GOT AN NINETEEN EIGHTY TRANS AM THAT I'VE HAD UH SINCE IT WAS NEW
AND I'VE HAD VERY GOOD LUCK WITH IT UH HAVEN'T HAD MANY REPAIRS DONE AT ALL THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND UH THE I HAD TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE
BUT UH OTHER THAN A FEW TRANSMISSION LEAKS THAT I GOT REPAIRED UH I REALLY HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING BUT UH REGULAR MAINTENANCE
YEAH I CHANGE THE OIL AND I DO THE LUBRICATION
BUT IF ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS SAY LIKE UH TRANSMISSION LEAKS I TOOK IT IN FOR THAT
AND I HAD TO HAVE AN ALIGNMENT DONE LAST YEAR SO I HAD THAT DONE
UH NOT REALLY IT'S NOT TOO EASY
I HAD PAST UH STATE INSPECTION UH JUST LAST MONTH SO
AND I HAD A TURN SIGNAL OUT SO I HAD TO TAKE IT IN TO GET THE TURN SIGNAL FIXED BUT UH OTHER THAN THAT FOR PASSING INSPECTION UH THEY GAVE ME A SHOPPING LIST OF THINGS I NEEDED TO GET DONE
NAMELY UH RE- PUTTING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BACK ON THE CAR
AND FIXING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE
SO THOSE THINGS I COULD DO MYSELF IT WASN'T A PROBLEM
TEXAS
UH-HUH
I HAD THAT PROBLEM WITH A NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT CAMARO
I NEVER DID GET IT FIXED
IT IT COULD BE THE STARTER THAT IT JUST GETS TOO HOT
YEAH
HM
YEAH
RIGHT THEY NEVER DO
UH-HUH
I'VE HEARD OF THAT PROBLEM WITH MANY OTHER DIFFERENT CARS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PREVALENT WITH JUST ONE MANUFACTURER
I WON'T BUY A DODGE
MY DAD HAD ONE HE HAD A DODGE
SIX HUNDRED AND AFTER THIRTY THOUSAND MILES THE HEAD GASKET WENT OUT
NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH IT SO HE FINALLY TRADED IT IN AND ACTUALLY BOUGHT A FORD ESCORT
OH A LOT OF PEOPLE DO LIKE FORDS YEAH
SURE
YEP
I'M READY FOR A NEW CAR MYSELF BUT I'VE HAD THIS CAR FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND IT'S GIVEN ME SUCH LITTLE TROUBLE THAT I I I DON'T THINK I COULD GET AN ADEQUATE REPLACEMENT THAT WOULD UH CAUSE ME TO LE- HUH
UH-HUH
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT ABOUT THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
RIGHT
I HAVE NO IDEA I KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ENGINEERED VERY WELL BUT I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME JUSTIFYING SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY ON ANY CAR
UH-HUH
RIGHT
NO DEALERS WILL G- GET YOU ON THE OIL CHANGES ANYWAY I TOOK MY CAR IN ONE TIME MANY YEARS AGO FOR AN OIL CHANGE AT THE DEALER AND THEY CHARGED ME THIRTY DOLLARS FOR IT
THEY THEY GAVE ME THIS COCK AND BULL STORY THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS A TURBO CHARGER ON THE CAR THEY HAD TO PRIME THE TURBINE WITH THE OIL
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A BUNCH OF HOG WASH I- I'VE CHANGED THE OIL MYSELF I'VE PUT A FILTER ON YOU KNOW PUT THE OIL IN AND ALL IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL
NO I HAVE TO GET UNDER MY CAR TO GET THE OIL FILTER OUT BUT YEAH YOU CHANGE IT FOUR TIMES A YEAR IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL FILTER YOU CAN BUY THAT ON SALE FOR TWO DOLLARS UH THE OIL UM LESS THAN A D- D- LESS THAN A DOLLAR A DOLLAR A QUART IT'S REALLY NOT THAT
UH-HUH
RIGHT
WELL I CAN GET THE FILTER OFF JUST BY LAYING DOWN UNDERNEATH THE CAR I CAN'T CRAWL UNDER IT THE CLEARANCE ISN'T ENOUGH BUT ENOUGH TO REACH UNDER AND GET THE FILTER OFF IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
YEAH
UH-HUH FOR ANYTHING ELSE I'LL PUT THE CAR UP ON JACK STANDS
OH YEAH
WHEN PUTTING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BACK ON I HAD TO PUT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR UP ON JACK STANDS
BUT IT WASN'T A REAL PROBLEM
YEAH EVERY THREE THOUSAND MILES I'LL CHANGE THE OIL I'VE GOT ABOUT NINETY FOUR THOUSAND MILES ON THE CAR RIGHT NOW
AND UH ITS WORKING JUST FINE I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL SO I'M GOING TO KEEP IT UH I GET OFFERS  EVERY NOW AND THEN FROM
FROM GROCERY STORE BAGGERS THAT WANT TO BUY MY CAR BECAUSE IT'S A TRANS AM THEY'RE HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEY GOT TO IMPRESS THEIR GIRL FRIEND
THE TROUBLE IS THEY THINK THEY CAN BUY IT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS
YEAH IT'S IN GREAT SHAPE UH BODY IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE IT JUST NEEDS PAINT I NEED TO LOOK UP SOME PLACE TO UH TO GET THE CAR PAINTED
A NEW CAR
OH I'M NO- I DON'T THINK I'M IN THE NEW CAR MARKET
A NEW CAR THAT REALLY HARD PICK
WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT I JUST GOT RID OF A CAR  BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT TO DO SOME MAJOR REPAIRS
UM I HAD A FORD ESCORT WITH ABOUT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND MILES ON IT AND THE ENGINE WAS SHOT UM
I I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS UH THE HEAD GASKET NEEDED TO BE REPLACED
AND UM
BUT NOBODY WOULD DO JUST THE HEAD GASKET EVERYBODY WANTED TO OVERHAUL THE ENGINE ENTIRELY
RIGHT AND UM
UM
I DID GET THE WATER PUMP WAS SHOT AT THE SAME TIME SO I GOT THE WATER PUMP FIXED JUST TO CARRY ME OVER UNTIL I COULD SELL THE CAR UM
WHICH I WHICH SURPRISINGLY THE CAR WAS IN GREAT DEMAND UM IN FACT I HAD A BUNCH OF PEOPLE COME TO LOOK AT IT AND THEY WERE FIGHTING OVER HOW MUCH THEY WERE GOING TO PAY ME FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK I WAS AMAZED
I GUESS SO UM BU- I ENDED UP BUYING A UM A USED CAR TO REPLACE IT I GOT A UH EIGHTY FIVE DODGE ARIES WHICH ONLY HAD THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND MILES ON IT
AND UH SPEAKING OF REPAIR PROBLEMS UM THIS CAR HAS A HAS AN INTERESTING PROBLEM THAT NOBODY SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO FIX DO DO YOU FIX CARS
WOW
YEAH
BUT DO YOU DO ANYTHING YOURSELF I MEAN
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU CAN DO YOURSELF IS IT  UNLESS YOU HAD THE EQUIPMENT
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH WHAT NOW WHAT STATE ARE YOU IN
TEXAS YOU'RE IN TEXAS SO AM I
UM YEAH THE THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS DODGE UH THIS DODGE ARIES IS THAT IF I DRIVE THE CAR FOR REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME ENOUGH TO GET THE CAR HEATED UP
AND THEN I RUN T- RUN OUT TO DO A QUICK ERRAND AND JUMP BACK INTO THE CAR IT WON'T START
AND IT WON'T START UNTIL THE CAR IS COOLED OFF
I'VE LEARNED THAT
AND AS SOON AS IT COO- COOLS OFF IT'LL START RIGHT UP
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM
OH
YEAH
YEAH SOMEBODY SAID THAT UM
THAT UH THERE MUS- THERE'S PROBABLY SOME KIND OF SHORT IN THE STARTER
AND THAT WHEN THE CAR HEATS UP IT UH THE METAL EXPANDS TO CREATE THE SHORT
AND THEN I- I- IT ISN'T UNTIL THE CAR COOLS DOWN THAT THE METAL YOU KNOW THESE TWO PIECES AREN'T TOUCHING ANY MORE AND AND UH AND YOUR YOU YOU KNOW THEN IT'LL START BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE SHORT
BUT I'VE TAKEN IT TO A MECHANIC AND AND HE STARTED TO LOOK AT IT IN FACT I DROVE IT OUT THERE AND I SAID I BET YOU ANYTHING IF YOU GO TRY START THE CAR RIGHT NOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO START IT SURE ENOUGH HE COULDN'T AND THEY HAD TO PUSH IT INTO THE GARAGE
BUT THEY STARTED UH TRACING THE WIRES BACK TO SEE IF THEY COULD FIND ANY SHORTS OR ANYTHING AND AFTER THEY FIDDLED WITH THE WIRES THE PROBLEM DIDN'T UH DIDN'T RE- RECUR
THEY COULDN'T GET IT TO FAIL
AND SURE ENOUGH AFTER I'D TAKEN IT HOME FOR YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEM
BUT NOW IT'S STARTING TO RECUR AGAIN
SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE WEIRD THINGS I MEAN HE WAS WILL- HE SAID WELL I THINK IT'S IN THE IGNITION SWITCH IT'LL ONLY COST YOU EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS BUT I WON'T GUARANTEE THAT'S THE PROBLEM
UH YEAH AND I'M GOING WE- WE- I DON'T WANT TO GAMBLE SO I JUST LET THE CAR COOL OFF UNTIL I GET A HARD FAILURE
AND THEN UH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S REASSURING I'VE NEVER HAD A DODGE BEFORE
AND I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE A NICE LITTLE CAR IT'S A GREAT DEAL IT ONLY HAD THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND MILES ON IT
AND OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL
YOU WON'T  OH YEAH
YEAH
OH REALLY HOLY MACKEREL
OH JEEZ
I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF LUCK WITH FORDS UM UM I'M NOT GONNA I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND CLAIM THAT THEY'RE THE BEST CARS IN THE WORLD BUT
YEAH I MEAN THIS THIS ESCORT EVEN WHEN THE HEAD GASKET WENT I MEAN IT WOULD START FIRST TIME EVERY TIME
AND UH
UH SO I- I'VE JUST BEEN REAL PLEASED AND MY STEP FATHER HAPPENS TO WORK AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND THAT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE EASIER COME CAR TIME BUT
YEAH
YEAH
I JUST UH I WAS JUST TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO'D HAD A SOME KIND OF I THINK HE HAD A CUTLASS
AND HE HAD A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND MILES ON IT AND FIN- THE THING FINALLY WENT
SO HE GOES OUT AND HE BUYS A LEXUS
AND I'M GOING WHOA
YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW HE'S SINGLE HE'S APPROACHING FIFTY YEARS OLD
HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SPEND HIS MONEY ON
SO BUT UH I CAN- I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE I MEAN ARE THOSE CARS WORTH THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
REALLY
WELL IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE TALK ABOUT CAR REPAIRS I WAS GETTING MY OIL CHANGED AND I WAS SITTING IN THE LITTLE LOBBY IT'S ONE OF THESE YOU KNOW FIVE MINUTE CHANGE PLACES
AND THIS GUY COMES STORMING INTO THE LOBBY THERE AND HE SAYS UM
YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ADVERTISE A TWENTY DOLLAR OIL CHANGE AND YOU CHARGED ME THIRTY DOLLARS
AND THE GUY SAYS WELL YEAH BUT YOU GOT A MERCEDES BENZ AND IT TAKES A SPECIAL OIL FILTER
AND THE GUY WAS OH YEAH HE'S ALMOST PROUD THAT HE HAD TO PAY AN EXTRA TEN BUCKS TO GET HIS OIL CHANGED I'M GOING
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WORTH IT  I DON'T THINK SPENDING AN EXTRA YOU KNOW TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A CAR IS WORTH IT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW
YEAH OH YEAH
OH JEEZ
WHAT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I COULDN'T I TRIED TO DO THAT WITH MY ESCORT BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO CHANGE TO GET THAT OIL FILTER OUT WITHOUT THAT I COULD FIGURE OUT WITHOUT GETTING UNDERNEATH THE CAR
OOH
YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH I'D PREFER TO DO IT BUT THE ESCORT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET UNDER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT UP ON RAMPS OR ANYTHING IT JUST MADE ME NERVOUS
I MEAN CAN YOU CRAWL UNDERNEATH THERE OR IS IT
HUM
YEAH I JUST COULDN'T YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THIS UH THE THE DODGE WOULD BE PRETTY EASY TO CHANGE THE OIL ON I THINK
AT LEAST I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY CAUSE YOU CAN S- I MEAN THE OIL FILTERS I MEAN YOU CAN TOUCH IT IT'S RIGHT THERE
YOU'VE GOT JACKS IT MAKES ME NERVOUS
WHOA WHOA
YEAH YEAH HM
WELL I I YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A THAT'S THE BIGGEST HASSLE
I THINK THAT IF I HAD BEEN NICER TO MY ESCORT AND BEEN MORE DILIGENT ABOUT GETTING THE OIL CHANGES AND DOING THAT KIND OF STUFF I COULD HAVE PROBABLY GOTTEN ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND MILES OUT OF IT
YEAH
WOW WOW
GEE
YEAH
YEAH
ALL RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL I BET YOU I BET I MEAN IF IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION AND STUFF YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A PRETTY GOOD BLUE BOOK PRICE
WELL
THE PA- PAINT JOB YEAH IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK A NEW CAR WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK AT
YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WHAT KIND OF PET DID YOU HAVE AS  WHAT KIND OF PETS DID YOU HAVE AS CHILDREN
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL I HAVE UM I HAVE A CAT THAT I'VE HAD FOR ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS
AND I WOULDN'T TRADE HER FOR ANYTHING  I ALSO HAVE A CHILD
CAT'S LOT EASIER TO TAKE CARE OF THAN THE CHI- YOU CAN GO AWAY AND LEAVE HER FOR A FEW DAYS
YEAH I'VE LEFT HER WELL I'VE LEFT HER ALONE UP TO ABOUT FOUR DAYS
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T SHE'S REAL GOOD SHE DOESN'T OVEREAT OR ANYTHING
AND SO I CAN LEAVE FOOD OUT AND KNOW THAT YOU KNOW SHE ONLY EATS WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE CATS THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PUT DOWN THEY'LL EAT IT ALL
AND THEN IF I'M
IF I'M GONE LONGER THAN THAT THEN I'LL HAVE SOMEBODY COME IN AND UM YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT SHE HAS FOOD AND AND FRESH WATER USUALLY I JUST LEAVE A FAUCET DRIPPING IN A BOWL IN THE KITCHEN
AND I'VE EVEN SHE DRINKS OUT OF THE TOILET
UH-HUH
UH WELL YOU HAVE TO KEE- UH IF YOU DON'T KEEP THEM CLEAN MY FRIEND HAD GERBILS AND YOU COULD SMELL IT AS SOON AS YOU WALKED INTO THEIR TO HER HOUSE
YEAH

UH-HUH
WAS IT ARE THEY YOUNG DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD THEY ARE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
HOW OLD HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS
OKAY MINE'S FIVE
YEAH
THEY DO OR MY CAT DOES TO ME LIKE SHE DOESN'T LIKE ANYBODY BUT ME IN FACT NO ONE WOULD KNOW I HAD HER BECAUSE IF ANYONE COMES OVER SHE IMMEDIATELY GOES INTO HIDING
BUT UM
I I HAD A DOG FOR A WHILE BEFORE I HAD MY SON AND I GREW UP WE GREW UP HAVING DOGS AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE A DOG BUT
KIND OF LIKE FOR THE SAME REASONS AS YOU I JUST THE CARE THAT GOES INTO THEM AND YOU KNOW IF I YOU KNOW DECIDE TO TAKE OFF FOR A WEEK OR SO
YOU KNOW I CAN'T LEAVE A DOG LIKE I CAN LEAVE A CAT
AND PLUS THEY REQUIRE A LOT IN THE WAY OF TRAINING AND
WHICH NOW THAT I'M HOME WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD TIME TO DO IT IF I WERE GOING TO DO IT BUT
YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T YOU KNOW THERE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WITH DOGS IT SEEMS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT MORE VET BILLS
PLUS THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE TO GET
NOW MY CAT I'VE HAD HER FOR EIGHT OR NINE YEARS
I HAD HER SPAYED AND I HAD HER DECLAWED WHICH YOU KNOW WAS AN INITIAL EXPENSE BUT
THEN SHE HAS NOT BEEN SICK ONE DAY I HAVE NEVER HAD HER TO THE VET OTHER THAN JUST HER YOU KNOW HER MAINTENANCE STUFF
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WHENEVER I'VE HAD A DOG YOU KNOW SOMETHING ALWAYS YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALWAYS GETTING SICK OR YOU KNOW BREAKING A LEG OR
SOMETHING
AND I JUST I DON'T NEED THAT EXPENSE RIGHT NOW PLUS THEY EAT MORE AND
YEAH THAT YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SUCH A BIG PROBLEM HERE IN DALLAS
UM MY CAT STAYS INSIDE BECAUSE SHE'S DECLAWED SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT YEAH IF YOU HAD A DOG YOU KNOW THEY NEED EXERCISE AND YOU HAVE TO WALK THEM
NOT REALLY PETS JUST KIND OF THINGS
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL SPECIAL YOU KNOW I LIVE ALONE WITH MY FIVE YEAR OLD AND MY CAT AND I MEAN SHE REALLY DOES SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SHE CARES ABOUT ME AND
YOU KNOW IT IT GIVES YOU SOME STROKES THERE THAT YOU MAY NOT GET OTHERWISE BECAUSE I'M COOPED UP IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY
AND UM
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE IS AN AQUARIUM AND HAVE SOME REALLY NICE FISH
BUT UNTIL I GET IN A PLACE WHERE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO BE FOR  A LONG TIME THEY'RE JUST THEIR SO HARD TO MOVE
YEAH
YEAH AND NOW I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO HAVE AQUARIUMS AND I ENJOY
WATCHING THE FISH AND LOOKING IN AT THEM YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY I FEEL THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT AND READ ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND YOU NEED TO LEARN
WHAT FISH ARE COMPATIBLE YOU KNOW AND WHAT ONES YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER AND WHAT ONES YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW HOW TO FEED THEM AND HOW TO YOU KNOW TO CLEAN THEM YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT OF CLEANING AN AQUARIUM IS NOT VERY  PLEASING BUT
WITH FILTERS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT THEY HAVE NOW I MEAN THEY'RE ALMOST MAINTENANCE FREE
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S GOOD
OH
WELL THAT'S GOOD YEAH THAT'S NOT BAD
I HAD TWO I MANAGED I GUESS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH I MANAGED TO TALK MY PARENTS INTO LETTING ME HAVE A GERBIL
I WON'T TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO IT
POOR THING I- PART OF IT WAS MY FAULT I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF IT LIKE I SHOULD HAVE
DO THEY LIKE TO WATCH HIM
UH-HUH
HOW MANY DID YOU GET DID YOU GET TWO ARE THEY MALE OR FEMALE DOES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE
UH-HUH
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW
OH NO
I'VE HEARD THAT IT
THAT AFTER THEY HAVE BABIES THAT YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THE THEN YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THE MALE FROM THE FEMALE OR THE MALE COULD HURT THE BABIES
YEAH
OH NO
THAT'S FUNNY
OKAY WELL IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU
AND GOOD LUCK
WELL I'VE KIND OF RESISTED HAVING ANY PETS BECAUSE WELL I HAD SOME PETS AS A CHILD
BUT UH YOU KNOW NOW THAT I HAVE TWO KIDS THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE PETS
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM A LOT AND THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF TIME AND UM NEATNESS AND PLUS YOU KNOW NOW THAT I'M MARRIED I HAVE
A HUSBAND THAT I DO SOME THINGS THAT YOU KNOW HELP HIM
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE I HAVE PLENTY THINGS TO DO AND SO I THOUGHT THAT IF WE GOT A PET THAT THAT WOULD JUST BE ONE MORE PERSON
WELL THE KIDS YOU KNOW THE KIDS WANTED
THE KIDS LOVE ALL KINDS OF PETS YOU KNOW CATS AND DOGS AND THINGS AND I KNOW SOME KINDS OF PETS ARE MORE
INDEPENDENT AND AS A CHILD I HAD UM YOU KNOW LIKE A WE HAD A DOG AND WE HAD TURTLES AND
WE HAD UM
YOU KNOW SMALL LOT OF THE SMALL THINGS LIKE I KNOW WE GOT  A LITTLE BUNNY AT EASTER ONCE AND
A LITTLE BABY CHICKEN AND ALL THAT BUT THEY SAY YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT ANY MORE BUT UM
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
UH-HUH
YES
THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES ESPECIALLY CATS ARE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT BEING INDEPENDENT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
WELL WE JUST LAST WEEK WE GOT A GERBIL THAT'S A THING THAT I PICKED FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE THEY WERE WANTING TO HAVE A PET AND I I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ONE I PICKED GERBILS BECAUSE
THEY APPARENTLY THEY AREN'T LIKE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T SMELL AS BAD AS OTHER
YEAH OH THAT'S AWFUL AND I I DON'T LIKE THAT ODOR AND UM
AND THEY THEY DON'T REQUIRE AS MUCH BUT WE'LL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT IT WASN'T AS
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT UM I HAD TO LIKE LEARN TO
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE RUNNING AROUND YOUR HOUSE THAT IF YOU'RE UNACCUSTOMED TO THAT YOU WOULDN'T LIKE SUCH A BIG CHANGE AND
THEY STAY IN THEIR LITTLE CAGE AND  YOU THROW A FEW THINGS IN THERE THEY'RE NOT LOVING YOU KNOW LIKE A CA-
WELL WE'RE JUST GETTING USED TO THEM RIGHT NOW WE'RE KIND OF JUST LETTING YOU KNOW TOUCHING THEM
AND WE'VE PICKED THEM UP BEFORE BUT THAT WAS KIND OF SCARING THEM PRETTY BAD RIGHT NOW
WELL THEY THEY
SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW THEY WERE SMALLER COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER ONES
BUT WE
WE I DID THAT I
LET THE KIDS HAVE A PET BECAUSE
I WANTED THEM TO HAVE PRACTICE IN CARING FOR SOMEONE ELSE AND YOU KNOW NOT BEING SO SELFISH
THEY'RE FOUR AND FIVE
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEM TO JUST PRACTICE YOU KNOW HAVING SOMEONE ELSE TO CARE FOR AND
EVERYTHING I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PETS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PETS
BECAUSE THEY MAKE GOOD COMPANIONS AND
FRIENDS AND
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AND
KEEP THE FLEA POWDER AND THE FLEA DIP AND
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THAT'S TRUE THEY ARE A LOT I GUESS THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY I'M
I'M NOT REALLY READY TO HAVE A PET TOO MUCH  I KIND OF CONSIDER THESE GERBILS JUST KIND OF SOMETHING YOU LOOK AT
YEAH THEY ARE NOT
BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY KNOW YOU YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE A PET PE- A PET IS SOMEONE THAT COMES UP TO YOU AND IS HAPPY TO SEE YOU AND THAT KIND OF THING
BUT
UH-HUH
THAT'S TRUE
UM
A LONG TIME
YES AND THEY THEY TAKE UP A LOT OF YOU KNOW GOOD SPACE LIKE KIND OF LIKE A BOOKCASE
UH-HUH HUH
NO
YES AND I NOTICED UM THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WAS ATTRACTED TO THESE GERBILS FOR IS THAT THEY THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AREA THAT THEY USE LIKE THEIR BATHROOM
AND YOU CAN JUST UM YOU KNOW RINSE THAT OUT IT'S KIND OFF TO THE SIDE IT UNSCREWS AND
AND SO YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT OUT WITH A GARDEN HOSE RINSE IT OUT
AND YOU DON'T  SUPPOSEDLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ALL OF THE THE BEDDING AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT EVERY THREE WEEKS WHICH IS NOT VERY OFTEN
UH-HUH
OH NO
OH
UM
WELL I'M HOPING THAT IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT OF DIVERSION FOR THE KIDS AND A LITTLE BIT OF A
THEY DO AND THEY'RE ANXIOUS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HOLD IT BUT I
THESE JUST AREN'T GOING TO BE AS TAME AS THE BOOK I GOT A BOOK FIRST
THEY JUST DON'T SEEM LIKE UM WELL I GUESS WE'VE HAVE THEM ABOUT A WEEK NOW AND THEY'RE JUST NOT KIND OF
TWO
WELL WE HOPE THAT WE GOT TWO FEMALES SO THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET ALONG BETTER
AND UM AND THEY WON'T HAVE ANY BABIES
I GUESS WE WON'T KNOW UNLESS THEY NEVER HAVE ANY BABIES
WELL BUT YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT SOLD THEM GO WELL IT'S HARD TO TELL BUT WE THINK AND WE'RE GOING OH GREAT
SO IF THEY HAVE BABIES THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GET RID OF ONE OF THEM

SO WITHIN A MONTH I GUESS OR TWO WE'LL KNOW

OH I'VE WATCHED THE NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK TEAMS YOU KNOW I- THEY'RE COMBINED
I'VE WATCHED THEM TWICE AND THEY LOOK LIKE BUMBLING IDIOTS OUT THERE AT TIMES
UH THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
AND I KNOW THEY DO
THEY'VE GOT TO KNOW
BUT I WATCHED THEM WHEN THEY WAS PLAYING THAT TEAM OVER THERE IN NEW ENGLAND I THINK IS WHERE IT WAS AND UH
LAST WEEK I WATCHED THEM PLAY
AND THEY JUST THEY LOOKED TERRIBLE
BUT THEY GOT THE THE NFL BACKING THEM SO THEY MIGHT MAKE IT
UH
YEAH WELL WELL UH THAT'S HOW I GOT TO LIKING DOUG FLUTIE HE WAS PLAYING FOR THE GENERALS
ON UH THE UH USFL
AND DOWN IN MEMPHIS THEY HAD A UH TEAM CALLED THE SHOWBOATS
AND UH YOU KNOW I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE SHOWBOATS MUCH BUT I DID LIKE A COUPLE OF THEIR PLAYERS
UH AND A COUPLE OF THEM EVEN WENT TO THE UH NFL I JUST DON'T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES
UH DOUG FLUTIE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT STICKS OUT IN MY HEAD FOR SOME REASON
UH I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT DITKA DONE TO HIM THAT JUST PUT IT IN MY HEAD AND KEPT IT THERE
BUT UH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH WELL I THAT THE LONDON KNIGHTS I THINK IS WHO IT IS
UH THEY WERE A FAIRLY DECENT LOOKING TEAM
THEY TAKE THE FOOTBALL SERIOUS
UH SHOOT I DON'T REMEMBER REMEMBER WHAT THE SCORE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT
NO COMPETITION
YEAH I KNOW THEY TAKE THEIR SOFTBALL SERIOUS OR THEIR SOCCER SERIOUS I MEAN
AND SO I GUESS THEY WOULD TAKE IT SERIOUS I I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT
I GUESS THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY STARTS HARPING DOWN I'LL JUST BRING THAT UP
THAT'S A GOOD COME BACK THANK YOU
WHAT ABOUT YOUR KICKERS
KICKERS ON SO- FOOTBALL TEAMS
OH
I I'VE I'VE BARELY MADE IT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

REGGIE ROBY
HE MIAMI
UH
AT TIMES I LIKE KEVIN BUTLER ON THE BEARS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME TEAMS UH SOME GUYS I LIKE ON THE BEARS
HE'S HE'S ALL RIGHT
BUT THEY GOT UH
UH WHAT'S HIS NAME
I WAS GOING TO MENTION MAJKOWSKI BUT HE'S A QUARTERBACK
OH WELL I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME
CAN'T EVEN THINK OF WHAT TEAM HE PLAYS FOR EITHER
THAT'S REAL BRIGHT
YEAH WELL
ALL RIGHT BYE-BYE
WELL I DON'T KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD MIXED EMOTIONS I GUESS WHEN I LISTEN TO UH THE RADIO AND AND WATCH TV ABOUT THE DIFFERENT UH THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING I UH I'M AGAINST IT BUT ON THE SAME TOKEN UM I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED A GUN JUST BECAUSE I
WANTED THE RIGHT TO DO THAT  SO I I HAVE A RIFLE IN THE HOUSE UM THE AMMUNITION IS PROBABLY SO OLD I'M AFRAID TO USE IT BUT UH
I BOUGHT IT FOR TARGET PRACTICING AND UH AND ALSO BECAUSE I WANTED A WEAPON
UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT
HM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WELL UP UH UP IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE I'M FROM UH Y- YOU HAD TO GET A PERMIT BEFORE YOU COULD BUY ANY AMMN-T- AMM- AMMUNITION
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY GOOD AND I THINK IT THEY UH TAKES TWO WEEKS FOR THAT SYSTEM TO PROCESS UM YOUR REQUEST FOR UH
NOT AS A GUN PERMIT BUT UH BUT TO BUY AMMUNITION YOU HAVE TO GET A P- PERMIT FROM THE POLICE STATION IN YOUR LOCAL AREA TO DO THAT
YEAH UM
I I I AGREE I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS UH  TO
TO STOP THE IMPULSE BUYER FROM UM BUYING IT QUICKLY AND AND UM MAYBE PUTTING A WEEK'S WAITING PERIOD OR SOMETHING ON IT BUT IF SOMEONE'S REALLY DETERMINED TO TO PICK UP A FIREARM UH YOU CAN PICK IT UP ANYPLACE AND YOU CAN GET THEM REALLY CHEAP
UH-HUH
HOW LONG WAS THE WAITING PERIOD OUT THERE
AH THAT WASN'T TOO TOO BAD
BECAUSE I- IF YOU'RE GONNA GO BUY SOMETHING UM OF OF THAT NATURE I THINK YOU'VE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME IDEA AS TO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH IT YOU'RE NOT GONNA REACT THAT QUICKLY IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW YOU -ON'T HAVE A NEED TO GO BUY A GUN TO GO SHOOT IT THE NEXT DAY
YEAH I DO TOO UH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE UH UH WHETHER IT'S A PISTOL OR A SHOTGUN I SUPPOSE THEY BOTH DO THE SAME KIND OF JOB
UH YEAH I SUPPOSE I'D NEVER GOT SHOT WITH EITHER ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW UM I THINK YOU COULD RECOVER FROM A PISTOL BUT NOT FROM A SHOTGUN
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH
UH  I'VE GOT A A MANUAL SINGLED SHOT AND I GUESS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ANY AUTOMATIC FEATURES TO IT THE FURTHER AWAY I GET THE THE UH WIDER THE SHOT GETS FROM THE TARGET
AND THE CLOSER THAT I GET THE TIGHTER THAT IT GETS
IT'S GOT A HELL OF A KICK TO IT
DO YOU BELONG TO A GUN CLUB OR YOU UH
UM-HUM
NO KIDDING
HUH WELL THE THE UM UH CLUBS THAT WE'VE GOT AROUND HERE ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT UH IT'S WELL WORTH IT YOU CAN GO DOWN AND SHOOT UP AGAINST A SAND BAG AND SO- TARGETS AND HAVE UH COMPETITION
UM I'VE NEVER REALLY JOINED A CLUB BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT THE TIME NOT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT THE DESIRE UH THERE'S AN ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE
UH THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY HIGH PLUS THERE'S INITI- INITIATION FEE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY AS A FIRST TIME UH UH MEMBER
SO THE WHOLE PROCESS CAN COST YOU A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS JUST TO JOIN THE CLUB PLUS YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THE AMMUNITION IN ANY TOURNAMENTS THAT YOU WOULD JOIN IN
UH-HUH
I THINK THE THE GUN CLUBS SERVE A USEFUL PURPOSE IN FACT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEHOW THEY TIE THE LEGISLATION INTO NOT ONLY WHEN YOU BUY A WEAPON YOU HAVE TO UH SHOW THAT YOU'VE GONE TO SCHOOL OR GONE TO SOME CLASS TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT WEAPON
AND YOU KNOW IT IT EVEN A- AFTER YOU WAIT YOUR NINE DAYS IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO HAND- IT'S JUST LIKE PUTTING SOMEONE IN AN AUTOMOBILE THAT DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND YOU GIVE HIM A LICENSE BECAUSE HE WAITED NINE DAYS
HE COULD HE COULD NOT ONLY UM UH SHOOT HIMSELF HE COULD HE COULD UH MISHANDLE A WEAPON LEAVE IT AT HOME AND LET A CHILD GET AT IT
WOW HE WAS FORTUNATE HE COULD HE COULD OF HIT SOMETHING ELSE
WOW
HOW ABOUT UH PRIVATE CITIZENS SELLING UH WEAPONS LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO SELL YOUR PISTOL TO ME
HUH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT DO YOU BELIEVE THERE OUGHT TO BE LEGISLATION GUIDING THE UM BUYER AND THE SELLER AND OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SYSTEM UH BECAUSE YOU OWN IT
YEAH BUT IS- ISN'T THERE A WAY TO UM TO DEREGISTER YOURSELF AFTER YOU REGISTER A GUN
BECAUSE I
HAVE
YEAH IS IT REGISTERED
THE UM THE RIFLE THAT I'VE GOT IS NOT REGISTERED AND UM I DON'T KNOW WHY I NEVER REGISTERED IT BUT THE UH
THE UM THE
YEAH
YEAH I GUESS THAT COULD HAPPEN IT'S JUST LIKE THE UH THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM ONCE THEY UH THEY GAVE EVERYBODY A NUMBER AND NOW THEY'RE MAKING YOU UM UH GET ONE AT AT BIRTH
AND ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR NUMBER THEY HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR IDENTIFICATION AND IF YOU TRY TO TO DO ANYTHING UM LIKE UH NOT IDENTIFY YOURSELF TO THE GOVERNMENT THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE
AND THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT YEAH YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT UH UM FED- WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KNOWS ABOUT PEOPLE
THEY PROBABLY DO
YEAH
UH-HUH
DO YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT PICKING UP UH GUNS THAT THAT ARE NOT REGISTERED
NO I DON'T EITHER I CAN I CAN BUY SOME UH TODAY IF I WANTED TO JUST YOU KNOW PUT UP THE MONEY
UH-HUH
YEAH
AND THERE'S THERE'S NO WAITING PERIOD ON THAT
YOU SELL THE REFRIGERATOR YEAH
HM YEAH I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS UM IS REALLY FAR AWAY FROM UH
UM CONTROL I I DON'T BELIEVE IN UM SHOULD I SHOULDN'T PROBABLY SAY CONTROL I MEAN REGULATION CONTROL IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULDN'T WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HAVE B- UM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM HAVE  A MONITORING CAPABILITY
SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO HAS WHAT WEAPONS
YEAH
UH WELL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY YOUR OPINION IS ON GUN CONTROL
WELL I THINK UH DOWN HERE IN TEXAS THEY DON'T HAVE A WAITING PERIOD ON HANDGUNS
AND I THINK THEY NEED THAT UH NOW I DO HAVE A I HAVE A PISTOL IT'S A LITTLE TWENTY TWO AND I HAVE A TWENTY TWO OR A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN
AND YOU KNOW I DO LIKE TO HAVE MY GUNS UH I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER USE IT
YOU KNOW AND LIKE YOU MY BULLETS TO MY LITTLE PISTOL'S PROBABLY UH ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD  UH MY GUN HASN'T BEEN SHOT IN A YEAR OR TWO
BUT UH I LIKE TO HAVE THEM WHERE HANDY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE NICE BUT A- YOU KNOW THE CRIMINALS THAT ARE GOING TO GET THEIR GUNS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
YEAH
I KNOW I- I UH TH- I HAD A WAITING PERIOD ON MY PISTOL BECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN UH TENNESSEE AND UH THEY HAD A WAITING PERIOD AND UH
WE BOUGHT IT THERE AND
ABOUT NINE DAYS
NO  NO
YEAH SOMEBODY WANT DO TH- I I AT TIMES I THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A WAITING PERIOD ON ALL FIREARMS
SHOTGUN HURTS WORSE THAN A PISTOL DOES
A SHOTGUN'S GOT TOO MUCH OF A SPREAD OR AT LEAST OURS DOES UH IT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE UH
THING ON THE BO- BOTTOM OF TH- ON TOP OF THE BARREL WHERE YOU A- YOU TURN IT YOU CAN MAKE IT EITHER TIGHT OR AS LOOSE AS LOOSE CAN GET AND THE SPREAD CHANGES
YEAH
YEAH MY HUSBAND HAD A UH
A POLICE GUN AT ONE TIME AND I SHOT THAT THING ONE TIME ALMOST KNOCKED ME DOWN IT WAS JUST A LITTLE  I DON- I FORGET I THINK IT WAS A THREE FIFTY SEVEN I'M NOT SURE
HE BELONGED TO ONE AWHILE BACK
UH SINCE WE MO- WE'VE ONLY BEEN HERE IN TEXAS FOR ABOUT A YEAR  UH WE CAN'T EVEN FIND A PLACE TO SHOOT JUST FOR TARGET PRACTICE
BUT I'D LOVE TO GET USED TO THAT SHOTGUN WE TRADED HIS PISTOL FOR THAT SHOTGUN
YEAH WELL THAT'S WHAT UH MY HUSBAND WH- WHEN HE WAS IN IT GUN CLUB WHEN THEY'S DONE THAT IT YOU KNOW HE WENT MOSTLY JUST TO UM SHOOT AT PAPER TARGETS
UH BUT YOU KNOW THEY USED SPEED AND ACCURACY AND ALL THAT
THAT'S A GOOD I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YEAH THAT AND YEAH
AND WELL WE UH WE WAS LIVING ON A NAVY BASE DOWN IN MEMPHIS AND UH THIS ONE GUY DECIDED TO PLAY UH LONESOME COWBOY OR SOMETHING AND HE WAS TWIRLING HIS GUN AROUND AND SHOT HIMSELF IN HIS FOOT
HE WENT TUMBLING DOWN THE STEPS ALONG WITH
UH SHOOTING HIS FOOT ALMOST OFF HE BROKE HIS LEG AND A COLLAR BONE AND COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS I'M SURE BEING MISTER COWBOY I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE NA- TERM WAS GOING AROUND IT WAS ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE YEARS AGO
NAW TH- I GUESS THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
UH THAT'S A HARD ONE BECAUSE WE DID THAT BUT UH I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME RULE AGAINST IT I'LL UH
YOU KNOW THE PERSON WHO SELLS THE GUN OUGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELF BECAUSE IF THAT GUN'S REGISTERED TO THEM AND SOMEBODY ELSE USES THAT GUN IN SOMETHING
AH  I HAVE NO IDEA
I'VE ONLY HAD ONE GUN AND I'VE KEPT IT YOU KNOW UH THE ONE GUN THAT WAS IN MY NAME
YEAH
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO REGISTER A SHOTGUN
WELL SEE UH MY HUSBAND HAS A THING IF THEY GO TO
UH REGULATING UH  UM
MY HUSBAND FEELS THAT THEY'LL COME AND COLLECT EVERYBODY'S GUNS
YEAH
AND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
UH I  BU- YOU KNOW THEY KNOW IT FROM HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE A WEEK TO UH
PROBABLY
YOUR UH
OH THE SOCIAL  YEAH THEY PR- THEY PROBABLY KNOW EVERYTHING FROM HALF THE TIME WH- HO- WHAT TIME YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM
NO THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE BITS EXTREME BUT THEY COULD KNOW ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU AND UH I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY GUN IF THEY GO TO BANDING BANNING THEM
I'D LOSE MY GUN BUT WE WOULDN'T LOSE OUR PIS- OR OU- SHOTGUN AND UH WE'RE WANTING TO GET A COUPLE MORE  I DON'T I DON'T UH
NAW
YEAH W-
YES WELL YOU CAN LOOK IN THE UH THE WE GOT THE THING DOWN HERE CALLED A SHOPPER
IT'S A A WHO A IT'S A IT'S A BARGAIN THING UH YOU GO AND EVERYB- YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SEE GUNS IN THERE FIVE TO SEVEN GUNS A DAY IT COMES OUT EVERY TUESDAY
NAW NONE WHATSOEVER YOU CA- CALL  W- WE SOLD A REFRIGERATOR THROUGH IT AND IT TOOK US ALL OF TWELVE HOURS
YEAH YOU KNOW AND I'M SURE IT'D BE EVEN LESS FOR SOMEBODY WITH A GOOD GUN
YEAH WELL I'LL AGREE WITH YOU THERE THEY DO HAVE TOO MUCH CONTROL OVER US ALREADY UH WE COULD LOOK AT OUR PAYCHECKS AND SEE HOW MUCH CONTROL THEY HAVE
YEAH I GUESS SO
I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE
WELL UH WH- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAST REPAIR WAS UH THAT THAT YOU HAD DONE TO YOUR CAR
I SEE
RIGHT
UM WELL I- I- I GUESS THE LAST THING THAT WE HAD DONE UH
WAS PROB- WE HAD TO HAVE NEW TIRES PUT ON IT AND UH IT'S SORT OF A LONG STORY WE HAD TO GET OUR CAR INSPECTED UH FOR THE STATE INSPECTION STICKER AND
UH THE THE GAS STATION I DIDN'T KNOW THIS BUT THE GAS STATION IF THEY REJECT YOUR CAR UH THEY PUT AN X ON YOUR INSPECTION STICKER AND AND UH YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT SAME STATION TO GET IT INSPECTED
YOU CAN'T GO TO A DIFFERENT ONE AND THEY DIDN'T PASS OUR TI- OUR TIRES ON UH ON MY CAR
SO UH WHAT THEY DIDN'T PASS THE UH THE BACK TIRES THE TWO BACK TIRES SO WHAT I DID I WENT DOWN AND BOUGHT TWO NEW UH TIRES HAD THEM PUT ON THE FRONT AND THEN MY FRONT TIRES WERE JUST ROTATED TO THE BACK
AND UH SO I WENT BACK TO THE GAS STATION AND UH THE GUY SAID WELL YOUR BACK TIRES STILL DON'T PASS
AND I SAID NO YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING BECAUSE I I JUST MOVED THEM AND I TOLD HIM WHAT I DID AND HE GOT HIS LITTLE GAUGE OUT AND SAID WELL THESE DON'T PASS
SO THEN I HAD TO GO BACK AND BUY TWO MORE OH LORD I WAS SO FRUSTRATED WITH THAT BUT UH
BESIDES ROUTINE OIL CHANGES I GUESS THAT WAS ABOUT THE UH THE LAST LAST MAJOR THING THAT WE'VE HAD DONE TO THE CAR
I SEE
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL SEE I DIDN'T EITHER -TIL IT HAPPENED
RIGHT RIGHT WELL I TELL YOU WHAT EVER SINCE THEN I FOUND A STATION THAT UH UH PRETTY CLOSE TO OUR HOUSE THAT
YOU KNOW THE GUY IS PRETTY LENIENT ON THE INSPECTION STICKERS SO UH HE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO GET MY BUSINESS I TELL YOU BUT UH
THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT THE
EXACTLY AND UH I DON'T KNOW IT MADE ME SORT OF QUESTION YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR TECHNIQUES FOR TESTING THE CARS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO GET TO ME AND UH I KNOW THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T BUT THAT'S UH
THE OUTLOOK YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND PLUS ME BEING UH UH N- NOT A MECHANIC YOU KNOW I I ALWAYS UH HAVE THE FEELING THAT PEOPLE ARE OUT TO GET TO ME AND I DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER YOU KNOW SO
RIGHT
OH LORD
HAVE A PHONE I SEE
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
I SEE WELL I I WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYING MORE ATTENTION WHEN I WAS OUT MESSING AROUND WITH UH MY DAD WHEN HE WAS UH OUT LOOKING AT THE CARS HE'S HE'S A PRETTY GOOD LITTLE HANDY MAN
BUT UH I I NEVER DID PAY ANY ATTENTION N- I NEVER REALLY WAS VERY INTERESTED IN CARS SO UH I'M I'M JUST THE TYPE THAT IF IT'S GOT GAS IN IT IT SHOULD IT SHOULD BE GOING
AND I NEED TO BE BETTER BECAUSE UH UH WE JUST BOUGHT IT MY WIFE AND I JUST BOUGHT A NEW CAR AND UH YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TAKE REAL GOOD CARE OF IT SO UH
I'M TRYING TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AT THE THE RIGHT TIMES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT UH THIRTY OR FORTY DOLLARS YOU HAVE TO PAY EVER- SO MANY MONTHS TO TO KEEP THE THING IN HOPEFULLY GOOD SHAPE
BUT UH I TH- I GUESS IT'D BE BETTER TO PAY IT OUT NOW THAN A BIG LUMP SUM DOWN THE ROAD
BUT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
OH LORD
JUST TAKING IT OFF
OH LORD RIGHT
OH
OH LORD
OH JEEZ
THAT'S HILARIOUS
T- TO GET THAT JACK O- THAT'S RIGHT OH THAT'S A FUNNY STORY
OH LORD
RIGHT
OH LORD OH JEEZ
THEY'RE ON BACKWARDS HUH OH JEEZ ALL THAT WORK AND
THAT'S RIGHT ANY TIME THAT'S RIGHT WELL THAT'S UH THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL I I FEEL LIKE I I WORK UH HARD ENOUGH AND MAKE ENOUGH MONEY I I CAN PAY SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF MY CARS
SO UH THAT'S RIGHT  THAT'S RIGHT WELL HEY I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION
ALRIGHTY BYE-BYE
I THINK THE LAST ONE WE HAD DONE ON A CAR HAD TO DO WITH UH THE TRANSMISSION I AND I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS THAT THEY DID I  SPEAKING FROM OTHER IGNORANCE
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAR
UH-HUH
OH YOU CAN'T GO TO A DIFFERENT ONE
OH
OH UH-HUH
OH MY
BUY TWO MORE
WELL THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN M- UH I- I- I HAVE A LITTLE STATION WAGON THAT I DRIVE TO WORK AND MY HUSBAND HAS A A VAN THAT HE USES IN HIS BUSINESS
AND HE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO YOURS JUST I'M THINK- IT WAS LAST WEEK OR OR I- I- IT WAS CERTAINLY WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
UH WENT TO GET HIS UH STICKER RENEWED AND HAD A COUPLE OF LITTLE THINGS LIKE THE CLIP THAT HOLDS THE UH OH THE MUFFLER PIPES
U- UP HAD BROKEN OR SHEARED OR WHATEVER AND THEY MEASURED THE TREAD AND I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT TO THE TIRES
AND HE HAD TO GET TWO NEW ONES TOO SO  I I I'D NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE SO MY MOUTH WAS OPEN THE WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
WELL YEAH YOU YOU WANT IT YOU WANT THEM TO CHECK WHAT'S WHAT'S NEEDFUL FOR YOUR SAFETY AND SO FORTH BUT THE OTHER SOUNDS LIKE A FLUKE WHEN THEY DIDN'T DO IT
Y- Y- YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN YOU WENT IN THE FIRST TIME UH THE IF THERE WERE IF YOU NEEDED FOUR TIRES OKAY FINE BUT TELL ME ALL AT THE SAME TIME
YOU CAN'T HELP FEELING THAT WAY
THAT'S THAT'S A COMMON FEELING I- I- I EMPATHIZE BECAUSE UM I WELL I'M REAL GLAD MY HUSBAND KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT CARS BUT WHEN I GO IN I FEEL REALLY AT A LOSS
AND AND IF WE TAKE MY CAR IN TO BE FIXED HE'LL HE'LL TELL THEM WHAT HE WANTS AND THEN HE'LL SAY WELL WELL CALL MY WIFE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE  AND THEN THEY CALL ME AT WORK BECAUSE HE HE DOESN'T WORK NEAR UH UH UH DOESN'T
HAVE UH OFFICE YEAH A PHONE AND AND SO THEY'LL CALL ME AND SAY WELL MRS PARKER WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AND WE'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS THE PROBLEM WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS MORNING IS NOT A PROBLEM BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS IS UH
AND SO THE ONLY WAY THAT I THE ONLY THING I KNOW TO DO IN IN IS IF IF IT SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE I'LL SAY GO AHEAD AND DO IT BUT SAVE ME THE PARTS OR SOMETHING SO I CAN HAVE HIM LOOK AT IT
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED US IS IS HIS BACKGROUND THERE
THAT'S
THAT'S
SURE
UH-HUH
ALL THAT SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE RIGHT
THAT'S THE T- THAT'S THE TRUTH I ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT I THINK IT WAS MORE TO SHOW OFF
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND I BE- BEFORE I WAS MARRIED I WAS TEACHING SCHOOL AND TEACHING DOWN IN CORPUS CHRISTI AND I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST CHANGE A FLAT TIRE
BETWEEN ARLINGTON WHERE MY FAMILY LIVED AND DOWN THERE AND SO I I HA- ONE DAY I HAD S- TOLD MY BROTHER I SAID NOW I KNOW EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSE TO CHANGE TIRE KNOW HOW BUT I SAID I CAN'T DO THAT WILL YOU HELP ME WILL YOU SHOW ME
AND SO I HAD HIM OUT THERE AND HE WAS HELPING AND MOTHER CAME TO THE DOOR AND SAID LARRY YOU'VE GOT A PHONE CALL SO HE WENT IN TO TALK TO ONE OF HIS MANY FRIENDS AND I I'M I'M DOWN I'M THERE WITH THIS TIRE OFF
SO I THOUGHT I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO I CAN DO THIS MYSELF AND SO OH I GUESS I WAS GETTING READY TO START THAT WAS IT IT WASN'T EVEN OFF SO I STARTED
JACKING IT UP AND AND AND SO FORTH AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE THE JACK SLIPPED IT'S ONE OF THOSE THAT HAS THE RATCHET KIND OF THING
AND I REACHED OUT TO GRAB IT AND IT CAUGHT THE THE WEBBING BETWEEN MY THUMB AND MY MY FOREFINGER
IT CAUGHT THE AND I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING I FORTUNATELY IT WAS LOOSE IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE CAR AND I I I COULD NOT GET MY MY I COULD JUST SEE ME THROUGH THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH THIS
JACK ATTACHED TO MY HAND AND I I COULDN'T SEE ANYBODY ON THE STREET NO OTHER KIDS ALL OVER SO I WENT TO THE TO THE DOOR
AND IT WAS SUMMERTIME THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS ON THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AND I COULDN'T KNOCK BECAUSE I HAD TO HOLD THE JACK WITH THE OTHER HAND I FINALLY WITH MY ELBOW RANG THE DOORBELL AND MOTHER CAME TO THE DOOR
AND I WOULDN'T LET HER TOUCH ME I I WANTED MY BROTHER TO HELP ME WITH THIS THAT WAS A SH- THE HE PUT THE PHONE DOWN PRETTY QUICKLY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE HIM LONG TO EXTRICATE
MY HAND BUT OH I WAS SCARED TO DEATH I I I COULD SEE HIM CUTTING OUT M- MY WHOLE PALM JUST TO GET THIS LITTLE FLAP OF SKIN OUT SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW MECHANICAL I AM
AND THAT WAS OH THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO SO I I'VE NOT TRIED IT SINCE OH PLUS PLUS BEFORE THIS I HAD PUT ALL THE LUGS BACK IN PLACE
BUT I HAD THE WRONG SIDE OUT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A RIGHT AND WRONG SIDE THE THREAD WORKED
AND SO I WAS SO PROUD AFTER HE GOT ME EXTRICATED HE LOOKED AT WENT OUT THERE TO CHECK IT OVER
AND HE JUST LAUGHED HE SAID SISSY I'M SORRY  BUT WE'RE GOING TO REDO THIS
SO UH
LISTEN I'LL CALL TRIPLE A UH AUTO CLUB ANY TIME
IT IT IT'LL SAVE YOUR FINGERS TRUST ME
WELL I ENJOYED IT JAY THANK YOU BYE-BYE
WELL THAT KIND OF CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE IT'S KIND I THINK I THINK THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED DRASTICALLY I MEAN I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MY MOTHER WHO
YOU KNOW GAVE UP THEIR CAREERS AND STAYED HOME TO RAISE KIDS AND UM
YOU KNOW PLAYED A REALLY SUBSERVIENT ROLE IN THE FAMILY AND I JUST DON'T SEE THAT ANYMORE AT ALL
EVEN WOMEN WHO DO STAY HOME TO RAISE FAMILIES I THINK THAT THEY ARE STILL THOUGHT OF AS EQUALS IN IN THE R- YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE ROLE IN THE FAMILY AND SOCIETY GOES
UH-HUH
UM
YEAH
DEFINITELY
I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM UH THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE IS THE WAY THAT WOMEN ARE PAID
I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THE STATISTICS ARE JUST STAGGERING YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THEY MAKE LIKE YOU KNOW SIXTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR WHAT MEN MAKE FOR THE SAME JOBS AND THA- I MEAN I CAN GET REALLY ANGRY ABOUT THAT
YEAH
WELL
THAT'S TRUE
BUT YOU KNOW I'M A SINGLE PARENT TRYING TO RAISE A CHILD AND IT REALLY UPSETS ME NOT TO BE PAID YOU KNOW THE SAME FOR MY JOB NOW I DON'T SEE THAT SO MUCH IN MY JOB BUT I KNOW IN OTHER PROFESSIONS
UM I KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE I KNOW YOU KNOW FRIENDS OF MINE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THAT
AND UH JUST YOU KNOW IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
YEAH YEAH
AND THEN TOO I THINK THAT
YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO THE WORKPLACE UNWITTINGLY JUST BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW TO RAISE A FAMILY NOWADAYS IT IT TAKES TWO INCOMES
THEY HAVE TO WORK AND THEN I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THEY GET STILL GET STUCK WITH MOST OF THE YOU KNOW RUNNING THE HOUSE TYPE CHORES
YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS AND YOU KNOW ARRANGING THEIR SCHEDULES AND
BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF OF THINGS I KNOW THAT I DO KNOW SOME MEN THAT THAT PARTICIPATE QUITE ACTIVELY UM YOU KNOW IN IN THINGS BUT I KNOW A LOT THAT DON'T SO
IT'S JUST A REAL SHAME YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHANGING ROLE OF WOMEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CHANGING ROLE OF MEN TOO BECAUSE THEY'RE DIRECTLY RELATED
YEAH
WELL THEY MAY YEAH I THINK EVENTUALLY BUT SOME MEN DON'T SEE SOME MEN JUST DON'T CARE
YEAH
YEAH I I AGREE WITH THAT
UH-HUH
YEAH
RIGHT IN DAY CARE
YEAH I AGREE I UH YOU KNOW IT'S FU- BEING SINGLE IT'S LIKE I ALMOST HAVE TO WORK RIGHT NOW I'M AT HOME BECAUSE I AM RECOVERING FROM SURGERY BUT UH
YOU KNOW I REALLY RESENT THAT IN THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME WITH MY CHILD
BUT UH I GUESS AS LONG AS YOU ARE SINGLE YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT YOURSELF NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU
SO
WELL I THINK THAT THAT THERE'S MORE YOU KNOW THERE IS DEFINITELY MORE WOMEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE UH I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT UH I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS I DON'T
THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS BUT UH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S PROGRESS
AND I'M NOT VERY POLITICAL SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU KNOW ANY I DON'T KNOW ANY STATISTICS ON YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE AND HOW OFTEN THEY'RE DEFEATED
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE WILL SEE A BLACK A BLACK MAN AS PRESIDENT BEFORE WE SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT
UH-HUH
SAME TYPE OF BATTLE YEAH
YEAH UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK A LOT OF UM STATES ARE UH DO YOU LIVE IN TEXAS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW WE HAVE A WOMAN GOVERNOR AND OF COURSE DALLAS I DO YOU LIVE IN DALLAS
IN SAN ANTONIO WELL
DO YEAH YEAH YOU DO NOW  AND UH WE HAVE A WOMAN MAYOR NOW TOO IN DALLAS AND HOUSTON HAS HAD A WOMAN MAYOR FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE THERE TOO
OH DID THEY
OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
HUH
WAS SHE ELECTED OR WAS IT SOMETHING THAT
UH-HUH
THAT'S INTERESTING I DID- I I I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
BUT UH
YEAH THAT'S RI- WHY I ASKED IF SHE WAS ELECTED OR IF IT IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED PASSED DOWN TO HER THROUGH THROUGH THE WAYS THAT THE LAWS WORK
BUT
UH I'M SURPRISED I REALLY AM SURPRISED YOU KNOW THAT MAJOR CITIES YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE TEXAS WOULD ELECT A WOMAN GOVERNOR
AND UH LIKE I SAID I REALLY HAVE NO INTEREST IN POLITICS IT'S JUST NOT MY FIELD BUT UH
YOU KNOW BEING A WOMAN I DON'T KNOW EVEN THAT I WOULD VOTE
FOR A WOMAN IN THE HIGH OFFICE
I CERTAINLY I WOULDN'T HAVE VOTED FOR ANN RICHARDS FOR GOVERNOR AND UH I CAN'T SAY THAT I WOULD VOTE FOR A WOMAN PRESIDENT NOW
WE MIGHT SEE A WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AND THEN OF COURSE IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO BE UH  IF SOMETHING HAPPENED SHE WOULD BE PRESIDENT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT SHE WERE ELECTED TO
UH-HUH
IS THAT RIGHT
NOPE
WHAT ABOUT  REAL WELL RESPECTED
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL HOW DO YOU THINK WOMEN'S ROLES HAVE CHANGED
UH-HUH UH-HUH UH-HUH
WELL I I UH JUST IN MY LIFETIME I KNOW THAT THE ROLE OF WOMEN HAS CHANGED DRASTICALLY ALSO MY MOTHER WHEN SHE BEGAN HAVING HER FAMILY SHE QUIT HER JOB AND STAYED HOME UNTIL
I'M THE YOUNGEST IN MY FAMILY UNTIL I WAS UH IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL OLD ENOUGH TO CARE FOR MYSELF WHEN I GOT HOME FIRST FROM SCHOOL
BUT I THINK THAT UH THE CHANGES IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WILL PROBABLY BE JUST AS DRASTIC YOU YOU'LL SEE MORE WOMEN CEOS AND MORE MORE WOMEN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICES
OH I AGREE
YEAH
IT IT'S PROBABLY ALL IT IT'S
THE ROLE OF WOMEN IS IS IN AN EVOLUTIONARY STAGE SO WE I'M SURE IT WILL EVENTUALLY EVOLVE TO WHERE IT IS EQUAL IT JUST HASN'T REACHED THAT POINT YET BECAUSE WOMEN UH HAVEN'T
UH BEEN IN POSITIONS SIMILAR TO MEN FOR THAT MANY YEARS RELATIVE TO HOW LONG MEN HAVE HAD THOSE TYPES OF POSITIONS
NO IT'S NOT FAIR
WELL THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO EXCEPT FOR YOURSELF INDIVIDUALLY AND AND STAND UP FOR
YOUR SALARY I MEAN FOR WHAT YOU WANT IN YOUR OWN JOB AND IF IF IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT GO FIND SOME PLACE THAT WILL DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
UH-HUH
WELL I THINK IT  DURING THIS IN THIS EVOLUTIONARY THEORY THAT I HAVE HERE THAT MEN WILL EVENTUALLY
EVOLVE AROUND TO WHERE THEY PARTICIPATE MORE IN THE HOME BECAUSE WHEN IT GETS TO THE POINT TO WHERE THA- THE HOUSE IS DIRTY AND THE KIDS ARE DIRTY AND AND MOM'S NOT HOME SHE'S AT WORK MEN ARE GOING TO GRADUALLY LEARN HOW TO DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
WELL AT I THE THE THE GENERATIONS THAT ARE BEING RAISED NOW BY WORKING MOTHERS I I ARE ARE A LITTLE MORE IN TOUCH WITH
THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES AND DUTIES AND WHAT HAS TO BE DONE SO I THINK OVER A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS TIME IT WILL ALL CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BEEN UH MY GENERATION I'M TWENTY FIVE AND AND MY GENERATION
GREW UP FOR THE MOST PART WITH MOTHERS IN THE HOME BUT AGAIN MY GENERATION PLAN OF WOMEN PLANS ON WORKING AND NOT BEING AT HOME
SO IT WILL BE MY CHILDREN WHO REALLY MAKE BIG CHANGES I THINK BECAUSE THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN
NOW ARE AT HOME WITHOUT THEIR MOTHERS WELL OR OR IN SOME TYPE OF A DAY CARE OR SOMETHING BECAUSE SO MANY WOMEN WORK NOW
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
WE- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WOMEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO GROW AND AND A- HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO GO IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO
UH-HUH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW ANY STATISTICS EITHER BUT IT'S IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE SAME TYPE OF SITUATION THAT THAT UH THE BLACK PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH IT TOOK THEM
A LONG TIME TO TO GET UP TO THE PAY SCALES OF THE WHITE MAN AND NOW I THINK IT IT'S FEASIBLE FOR A BLACK MAN TO BE PRESIDENT
UH-HUH AND SI- SINCE THIS EVOLUTION OR THIS THIS PROGRESSION OF BLACK MALE SALARIES AND ALL THAT WAS ALL BEFORE WOMEN WERE HEAVY IN THE WORK PLACE I WOMEN WILL PROBABLY GO THROUGH THE SAME
TYPE OF DEAL IT'S JUST FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD
YES
UH-HUH
NO I LIVE IN SAN ANTONIO
WE HAVE A WOMAN MAYOR
YEAH
YEAH
WELL TEXAS HAD A WOMAN GOVERNOR A HUNDRED YEARS AGO OR OR WHATEVER MA FERGUSON
YEAH YEAH I THINK IT WAS MA FERGUSON I KNOW TEXAS HAD A WOMAN GOVERNOR
I THINK SHE WAS I'M NOT SURE IT WAS A HUNDRED OR SO YEARS AGO SO I I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT REAL UP ON PAST HISTORY OR ANYTHING
I I'M THINKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE KIND OF DEAL WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS GOVERNOR AND HE DIED OR SOMETHING
I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
I WOULDN'T NOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ONE THAT'S THAT'S EQUIPPED TO HANDLE
NO I WHY I DIDN'T
BUT UH
UH-HUH
THE
THE PROBLEM I'M SORRY GO AHEAD
I UH I JUST I DON'T THINK A WOMAN PRESIDENT IS ANYWHERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF NOT JUST FOR THE JUST FOR AMERICAN PREJUDICE BUT
THE WORLD SEVERAL MAJOR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT WE DEAL WITH ALL THE TIME DON'T RESPECT WOMEN AS BUSINESS PEOPLE SO A WOMAN PRESIDENT WOULD BE

OKAY
WELL THE ONES THAT I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GET UM I GUESS YOU'VE SEEN THE 365 WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN AND 365 WAYS TO COOK PASTA I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GET THOSE BECAUSE WE EAT A LOT OF CHICKEN

TO DO WITHOUT RED MEAT
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF IT NOW AS LONG AS WE HAVE PLENTY OF VEGETABLES AND LOTS OF CHICKEN

I REALLY OF COURSE YOU WOULD OF YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY I I REALLY LISTEN TO A LOT OF THE TALK SHOWS I DON'T MEAN THE GOSSIP ONES BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

YEAH
OH YEAH THAT'S GOOD ACTUALLY
OH THAT'S GOOD
MY WIFE ALWAYS WONDERS ABOUT THAT SHE SAYS LOOK AT THAT PERSON HE'S DRIVING AND READING AT THE SAME TI-
YEAH
RIGHT
W- WE GET
GOOD
THAT'S A GOOD POINT THAT'S A GOOD POINT
OH YEAH IT COMES AND GOES
YEAH
LOCAL YOU MEAN
YEAH
DON'T THEY HAVE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND ALL THAT UH D- ARE ARE YOU INTO ANY OF THAT WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE AND THE SCHOOL BOARDS AND ALL THAT UH WE HAVE THAT ADDITION TO OUR PAPER
OH I SEE YOU YOU GET IT FROM PEOPLE THEN TO YEAH
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
MY WIFE I YOU KNOW IT MENTIONED THE THE QUESTION WAS UH DO YOU GET IT FROM PEOPLE TOO AND I I CAN SAY THE SAME THING YOU DO THAT UH MY WIFE IS UH SHE READS THE PAPER FROM FRONT TO BACK AND SO SHE'LL TELL ME SOME STUFF AND SHE'LL ALWAYS GET MAD AND SHE'LL SAY YOU DIDN'T READ THE UH
WELL I ALWAYS READ THE SPORTS UH WHAT AM I THINKING OF THE
THE COMMENTARIES I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF WHAT IT IS OFFHAND
SHE'S ALWAYS READING SOMETHING AND SHE SAYS WHY HAVEN'T YOU READ THAT AND I SAY I NEVER HAVE TIME TO READ IT LIKE YOU DO BUT WHICH I ALWAYS GET A LOT OF MY INFORMATION FROM THE NEWSPAPER THROUGH HER
UH SO I GUESS WE DO GET IT FROM PEOPLE TOO OH YOU MENTIONED CNNN OF COURSE I R- MENTIONED RADIO AND THE CNN TV NEWS YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME THING THAT'S ON THE RADIO WORD FOR WORD YEAH I-
Y- WELL IT IS CNN EXACTLY UH BECAUSE UH AND IT BECAUSE UH
WE HAVE IT HERE AT WORK A MATTER OF FACT AT TI THEY HAVE IT IN THE BREAK AREA CNN
AND BUT THE REASON I SAY THAT BECAUSE ON THE RADIO THEY'LL SAY AND LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW AND THEN WHEN I FIRST HEARD CNN IT ONLY STARTED ABOUT UH SINCE THE WAR YOU KNOW OR RIGHT BEFORE THAT
AND THEN THEY WOULD ALWAYS SAY AND LOOK AT THIS AND THERE'D BE PAUSE YOU KNOW AND AND YOU'D HEAR MUSIC AND STUFF AND I REALIZED IT'S THE EXACT COMMENTARY THAT'S YOU HAVE ON ON THE NEWS YEAH
BUT IT'S STILL GOOD IT'S STILL UH UH YOU KNOW IT'S YOU DON'T REALLY MISS ANYTHING BUT I D- I DO ENJOY UH SINCE THE THE GULF WAR UH LISTEN TO CNN RADIO TOO
AS WELL AS WATCHING CNN AND UH TV HERE AT WORK I DON'T HAVE CNN AT HOME ME TURN THIS MIC- RADIO OFF I'M I'M ACTUALLY AT WORK RIGHT NOW BELIEVE IT OR NOT
UH WHERE WAS I GO AHEAD Y- Y- YOUR TURN
YEAH I I HEARD THAT YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
OH YEAH
YEAH
I NEVER GET HOME EARLY ENOUGH FOR THOSE FIVE AND SIX O'CLO-
NO I'M NOT
AND I THINK A GREAT NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GOT WORD OF IT AND PARTICIPATORS IN GENERAL AND VOICE WHO HEARD ABOUT THE PROGRAM
I RELY PRIMARILY ON
ON NEWSPAPER COMBINED WITH TELEVISION
UH
OKAY
THAT'S RATHER INTERESTING
I'D I'D HAVE TO SAY I HAVEN'T EITHER
I LISTEN TO THE RADIO F- UH PROBABLY G- FIVE OR SIX HOURS A WEEK BUT ALMOST INEVITABLY TO A STATION THAT IS A CLASSICAL UH STATION HERE THAT BASED ON RESEARCH PRIMAL FOR MUSIC PURPOSES
WE DON'T USE THE RADIO AS A WAKE UP WE HAVE OUR A UH TELEVISION CONNECTED TO A UH
UH ELECTRONIC ALARM UH SYSTEM THAT KICKS IN AND IT COMES ON WITH CNN IN THE MORNING SO WE WE WAKE UP TO TELEVISION NEWS AND UH
UH SHOWER AND DRESS AND WHATEVER TO THAT AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MY WIFE AND I RIDE TO WORK TOGETHER UH IN A CAR
WE WE CHAT AT EACH OTHER RATHER THAN THAN SOMETHING ELSE
UH AND OCCASIONALLY WHAT WE'LL EACH DO DEPENDING ON WHO'S DRIVING IS HAVE THE NEWSPAPER SORT OF ON OUR LAP ON THE WAY IN IN THE CAR SO
WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO UH READ AND DRIVE ALTHOUGH THERE SEEMS TO BE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ON THE FREEWAY RECENTLY THAT A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE READING AND DRIVING
SO WE WE RELY PRETTY PRETTY HEAVILY I THINK ON A COMBINATION OF THE OF THE TWO I ALSO UH USE
UH NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE UH WE TEND TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN NEWSWEEK AND TIME AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE THE THE UH NEWS MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR FOR US AND UH I READ
SPORADICALLY OF COMMENTARY AND A COUPLE OF OTHER
YOU KNOW TRADE MAGAZINES AND UH UH SUCH AS THAT UH WHERE I I MIGHT READ
THE THERE THERE'RE OCCASIONAL SOCIAL AND EVEN CURRENT EVENT COMMENTARIES AND AND EVERYTHING AS DIVERSE AS ACM TO UH UH SOME OF THE THE OTHER TABLOIDS I GET SO
UH I GUESS I USE EIGHTY PERCENT WRITTEN IS PROBABLY MY INPUT AND AND TWENTY PERCENT UH TELEVISION I
I THINK I RESPECT THE FROM A JOURNALISTIC PERSPECTIVE CURRENT EVENTS I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT IT IT'S REALLY NOT INTERESTING UNLESS IT'S THREE WEEKS OLD AND AND FOUND ITS WAY INTO A A NEWS WEEKLY HEADLINE
UH OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A  AT BEST UH WE'RE PROBABLY NOT THRILLED WITH OUR ONLY NEWSPAPER THAT WE HAVE IN RALEIGH THERE THERE ARE OTHER UH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THEM THEY COM- THE THE SMALL UH COMPETING INDEPENDENT SORT OF NEWSPAPERS LITTLE SMALL WEEKLY THINGS BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE DAILY UH IT'S CALLED THE NEWS AND OBSERVER FONDLY REFERRED TO HERE BY SOME AS THE UH UH
SOMETIMES THE NOISE AND OBSERVER UH IT DEPENDS IT IT'S IT HAS DECENT NATIONAL COVERAGE BUT HAS AN EXTREMELY
FOCUSED POLITICAL COVERAGE PROBABLY STEEPED IN THE SOUTHERN HISTORY AND THE FACT THAT THAT THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC STATE AND UH CONSEQUENTLY EVERYTHING IS FILTERED THROUGH THAT REPU- UH REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATIC SORT OF
GLASS UH ALMOST UNNECESSARILY F- SO UH
YEAH WE WE HAVE THAT IS UH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY UPDATE IT ONCE A WEEK WITH A SPECIAL SECTION AND AND WE PAY IT SORT OF GLANCING NOD WE UH HAVE A VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS
UH TAPPED INTO THE CITY PLANNING STRUCTURE UH A DEVELOPER ARCHITECT FRIEND AND
RIGHT SO I THINK WE FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CITY UH ON A FAIRLY FREQUENT BASIS OVER A OVER A GIN AND TONIC SORT OF THING UH AND THAT PROBABLY GIVES US A BETTER INSIGHT AS TO THE CITY OF RALEIGH THAN THAN THE PAPER WOULD HAVE ANYWAY
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
IS THAT RIGHT I I HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOME STUFF ON THE ON THE RADIO THAT WAS EQUIVALENT TO CNN
OKAY
OKAY
OH THAT DIDN'T UH
UM-HUM
UM WE PROBABLY WERE LISTENING TO CNN FAIRLY HEAVILY BEFORE THE WAR BROADCAST BEGAN
UH WE ALMOST LIVED AND AND BREATHED IT FOR BECAUSE DURING THE WAR ITSELF TO THE POINT WHERE WE BEGAN TO
SORT OF HAVE HOUSEHOLD PACT OF LET'S TURN THE WAR OFF AND AND GET SOMETHING DONE
UH ALMOST AN ADDICTION UH AND AND WE COULD EQUATE OR RELATE WELL TO SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER AND TELEVISION ARTICLES ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHERE HAVING THIS PROBLEM IN IN UNHOOKING UNCOUPLING FROM THE EVENTS
AND GOING ON WITH THEIR LIVES UH INSTEAD OF BEING WATCHING THE MISSILES AND BEING GLUED TO THE TO THE TUBE AND WHATEVER
UH AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE BEGAN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE O- END OF THE WAR I GUESS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF THREE WEEKS IN WE BEGAN TO RESTRICT OUR NEWS ALMOST DELIBERATELY WHERE WE WOULD
UH WATCH UH FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER SIX OUR TIME WHICH WOULD BE NATIONAL NEWS OR OUR LOCAL NEWS
WE WOULD WATCH CNN UNTIL SIX THIRTY THEN WE WOULD WATCH UH A ROTATING NETWORK NEWS OF EITHER UH ABC CBS OR NBC AND WE WE SORT OF JUST ROTATED AROUND THE DIAL EACH NIGHT A DIFFERENT ONE
AND WE WOULD WATCH THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN TURN THE TELEVISION OFF AND AND WE WERE SORT OF UH LIMITING OR DIETING OURSELF ON ON NEWS THAT WAY AND THEN WE WOULD DO A SIMILAR THING
UH AT UH TEN FORTY FIVE BECAUSE UH CNN WOULD BE WRAPPING THEIR HOURLY COVERAGE UP AND THEN WE WOULD GET THE LOCAL COVERAGE UH
AND THEN I THINK THE LOCAL COVERAGE WE WOULD TEND TO WATCH THE SAME STATION THAT WOULD WOULD HAVE BETTER STATE COVERAGE RATHER THAN LOCAL COVERAGE UH THREE OF THE NETWORKS HERE ON THEIR LOCAL NEWS UH THAT
I- IF YOU WISH TO LISTEN AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO RAPED WHO MURDERED WHO OR STOLE WHAT FROM WHOM AND THAT WAS THE SORT OF THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THE BEST IN  AND NOT NEWS
UNLESS IT'S THERE'S SOME TREND OR OR SOMETHING THAT SAYS GEE THIS THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN HIT FORTY SEVEN TIMES OR WHATEVER UH THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF MORE OF A OF A PATTERN NEWS
AND ALL RIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN
THAT'S I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT I WANTED I WANT TO GO SEE THAT

I REMEMBER I WENT TO SEE DON QUIXOTE OVER THERE WHEN IT CAME OUT IT CAME OUT RIGHT AROUND THE TIME WITH SOPHIA LOREN

YEAH
UH-HUH
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT OUR POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA
YEAH WE- DO YOU THINK THAT'S DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT
YEAH
YEAH WELL I HAVE A FRIEND THAT'S UH HIS D- HIS DESCENDANTS ARE FROM UM
UH NICARAGUA AND  UH VERY I MEAN IT'S LIKE HIS MOTHER HIS MOTHER CAME OVER AND UH
HE YOU KNOW I JUST AS FAR AS FEELINGS
UH FOR PEOPLE THAT
THEIR FAMILY CAME FROM THERE AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR INTERVENTION AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND HE HE WAS ALL FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAY UH THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THERE THAT THAT
THAT GET THE KIND OF CONTROL THAT'S BAD YOU KNOW AND THAT THEIR GOVERNMENTS CAN BECOME SO CORRUPT AND IT'S LIKE WELL UH YOU KNOW I USE TO FEEL LIKE
UM WELL THEY THEY SHOULD WORK THEIR WAY THEY YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK THEIR SELF OUT OF IT OR YOU KNOW WHY WHY WHY INTERVENE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY'S YOU KNOW PROBLEMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHY WHY SHOULD WE BE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO DO IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT
I THINK JUST A LOT OF TIMES IF WE DON'T THEN THEN IT W- THEN THAT INFLUENCE WILL AFFECT OUR COUNTRY TOO FOR ONE AND FOR TWO
YOU KNOW THAT IT IT DOES HELP I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK THE PEOPLE IN THOSE COUNTRIES DO WANT OUR HELP THE PEOPLE THAT ARE Y- KNOW UNDER CONDITIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW NOT FAVORABLE TO THIS THEIR RIGHTS
SO
BUT
UM I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO I MEAN I- I'D RATHER EVEN IF A COUNTRY CHOOSES A GOVERNMENT THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW EXACTLY THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW OR OR IS IN COMPLETE
OPPOSITION TO IT AT LEAST IT'S THEIR CHOICE AS AS LONG AS LONG IT'S ONE THAT'S
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT STAYS IN POWER THAT CAN STAY IN POWER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THEM DON'T
YOU KNOW
OH YEAH
SO YOU THINK LIKE CIA INFLUENCE AND OUR MONEY OVER THERE
YEAH
OR OR GOVERNMENT AIDS AND STUFF
WELL THEN HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SAY AS FAR AS LIKE IN UM EUROPE AS FAR AS THE THE TOPPLING OF THOSE KINDS OF GOVERNMENTS
YOU KNOW LIKE
I MEAN
YEAH
BUT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT INTERVENING IN THAT OR DO YOU THINK THAT WE ARE TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE CAUSING
YEAH
SEE I- I AGREE WITH THAT YEAH
I- I AGREE THAT THAT THE COMMUNICATION UH THAT NOW THAT COMMUNICATION HAS BECOME
SO MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD AND YOU KNOW S- WORLDWIDE THAT PEOPLE ARE REALIZING HEY WE DON'T HAVE IT SO GOOD AND LET'S STAND UP
FOR YOU KNOW UH W- TH- THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE'RE LIVING WITH THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS IN A WORLD THAT'S ADVANCING AS FAST AS IT IS THAT UH I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST SAYING NO WAY WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE OF THIS
YEAH
YEAH WELL I MEAN
I DON'T MEAN TO WELL I GUESS I DO IN A WAY SOMETIMES I THINK A RELIGION HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THAT I THINK THAT THAT UH BECAUSE OF THOSE C- COUNTRIES A LOT YOU KNOW WHERE SUCH CATHOLIC INFLUENCE AND I THINK THE CATHOLIC RELIGION ITSELF
WAS WAS SUCH A DOMINANT FACTOR AS FAR AS KEEPING THE PEOPLE DOWN
SO TO SPEAK
BUT BUT SEE TH- BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC RELIGION AS FAR AS THROUGH THE AGES HAS BEEN THE RULE SO TO SPEAK
YOU KNOW THEY ARE THE ONES THAT SET THE RU- SET A LOT OF THE RULES AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT DO KEEP THE PEOPLE DOWN I MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE A RELIGION THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN ANYTHING IS BEING SAID YET THEY'RE
YET THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BOW DOWN TO IT I THINK THAT KEEPS PEOPLE IN A SORT OF LINE YOU KNOW
WELL WHEN WHEN IT USE TO BE LATIN I'M JUST S- SAYING THAT
UH
THE OLD CHURCH
YEAH WHICH IT'S NOT THAT WAY NOW BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS JUST THAT I THINK THAT IT'S JUST LATIN COUNTRIES ARE SLOWER IN COMING AROUND
WELL LATIN
UM THEY STILL DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH I DON'T THINK
BECAUSE I- I DESCEND FROM THAT AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T CAN'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND LATIN
AND I'M OF SPANISH DESCENT SO
UM
I- I JUST THINK THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHY LATINOS ARE TEND TO BE
YOU KNOW THE THE MEE- THE MORE MEEK YOU KNOW THEY TEND TO BE MORE
NOT STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS AS MUCH THEY'RE NOT REALLY SURE OF WHAT THEY ARE
I DON'T THINK
WELL I MEAN HOW CAN YOU CONTRAST TH- THE EUROPEANS AND THEIR VOCALISM ON THEIR RIGHTS TO TO SAY THE PEOPLE IN LATIN AMERICA I MEAN WHY ARE THEY
WHY ARE THEY NOT AS VOCAL OR WHY DO THEY NOT YOU KNOW STAND UP SO TO SPEAK FOR THEIR RIGHTS
UM-HUM
UM I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I DON'T AGREE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY ARE PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT IT
IN IN UH AFRICA
I THINK THEY'VE MADE A LOT MORE CHANGES
HEY THEY'VE THEIR VERY VOCAL
W- SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
YEAH
SO WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAY SOUTH AMERICA AND THE REST OF I MEAN SOUTH AFRICA AND IT IS REST OF AFRICA
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT MAYBE HAS TO DO WITH A LOT UH A LOT TO DO WITH EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE UH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
I THINK THEY ARE THEY DO TEND TO BE MORE EDUCATED MUCH MORE EDUCATED THAN
THAN AFRICA OR THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
UM-HUM WELL I KNOW THAT RUSSIA THEY'RE THEY'RE COMPARABLY MORE ED- BETTER EDUCATED THAN WE ARE IN OUR COUNTRY
YEAH
YEAH
UH IN OUR COUNTRY
YEAH
YEAH WELL THAT'S JUST IT THOUGH GOOD EDUCATION
IS IT GOOD EDUCATION IT MAY BE FREE BUT IS IT GOOD EDUCATION AND THAT'S JUST IT ARE WE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT YOU KNOW
I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE BITCH AND MOAN ABOUT THE TAXES AND ALL BUT ARE SO ARE THEY WILLING TO PAY FOR YOU KNOW
QUALITY EDUCATION YOU KNOW
SO YOU KNOW AND YET THEY YET PEOPLE GET VERY FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY SEE THE JAPANESE MOVING IN AND THE THE RUSSIANS MOVING IN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW THAT WE USE TO DOMINATE AND IT'S LIKE WELL YOU KNOW
THEY'RE EDUCATING THEIR PEOPLE TO HIGHER DEGREES THAN WE DO SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPECT IT SO WHAT YOU ARE YOU WILLING ARE YOU WILLING TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE AND AND PAY PAY SOME TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND PAY FOR GOOD QUALITY EDUCATION
OH I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF IT YEAH  NO I UH I THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB YOU KNOW NOT UH
NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR YOU KNOW OF THE FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRIES HAVE ON US YOU KNOW UH I MEAN WE COULD DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT EVEN MORE THAN WE HAVE BEEN I DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING TOO BAD
UM
WELL I THINK THAT UH AS A WHOLE THAT THE BEING THAT THE DRUG PROBLEM UH THE DRUG INDUSTRY CAN UH BRING SO MUCH MONEY TO A COUNTRY I THINK THAT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MATCHING THAT THE THE G- UH THE
THE DRUG UH CARTELS OR WHATEVER WOULD CONTROL MOST THE CENTRAL AND LATIN AMERICA
JUST THAT UH MONEY IS POWER AND UH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT EXACTLY YEAH
BUT UH
YEAH
WELL SOMETIMES THAT'S THAT'S AMERICA DOING THAT TOO YOU KNOW WE
WE FALL OUT OF UH AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN LEADERS AND THEN AMAZINGLY ENOUGH THE COUNTRY STARTS TURNING AGAINST OUR LEADER YOU KNOW  IT'S UH
THAT AND UH THAT AND YEAH THE AMERICA STARTS TALKING THEN ABOUT REMOVING BASES AND AND WHATNOT AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND PEOPLE
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK THAT HAS A LOT OF THINGS TO DID WITH UH UM
YEAH THAT WAS UH IT I'M I'M REALLY WONDERING WHETHER THAT'S GOING IT SETTLE DOWN OR NOT BECAUSE
ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THE THE YOU KNOW THE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT OF COURSE MISTREATING A LOT OF THE UH SLOVAK COUNTRIES AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE
WELL THEY THEY WERE FEEDING US  SO UH
I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
OH YEAH I THINK WE'RE GETTING UH QUITE A
PUT IT THIS WAY I THINK NO I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE REVOLTING THEMSELVES AND WE'RE
UH
ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN
YEAH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
YEAH I THINK UH CENTRAL AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE PASSIVE
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S ALWAYS THE MINORITY THAT ARE
ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND THEY WERE ALWAYS YOU KNOW HAVING TO MEET IN THE CATACOMBS AND ALL THIS SO ALL THE PERSECUTION THAT THEY'RE SORT OF USE TO IT IT'S BEEN SORT OF LIKE YOU KNOW
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT
DO I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING SAID
OH YEAH THE OLD CHURCH
YEAH
WELL THEY ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD IT IS IN AMERICA WHERE IT WAS HARD  LATIN THEY'RE YOU KNOW
VERY VERY VERY CLOSE TO SPANISH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
UH I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IN THAT WAY
I DON'T KNOW COULD BE THE THE ECONOMIC STILL  YOU KNOW THE THERE'S THE POVERTY LEVEL IS CERTAINLY UH YOU KNOW MUCH WORSE IN THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
I MEAN YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT AFRICA TOO I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE POVERTY LEVEL BECAUSE AFRICA IS CERTAINLY NOT A CATHOLIC UH COUNTRY AND YET
AND YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE KINGS AND SUCH
WELL IN SOUTH AFRICA YEAH
IN SOUTH AFRICA I THINK THEY ARE BUT YET YOU KNOW IDI AMIN WAS YOU KNOW IN POWER FOR SO LONG
UH RACIAL I THINK
OR LIKE YOU SAY MAYBE COMMUNICATION OF KNOWING THAT HEY UP IN OTHER ENGLISH COLONIES OR PREVIOUS ENGLISH COLONIES EVERYTHING IS EQUAL AND YET DOWN THERE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW
I THINK COMMUNICATION DOES HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IT
YOU KNOW IN EDUCATION MAYBE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EDUCATION BECAUSE THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS STILL NOT VERY EDUCATED DOWN THERE SO
SO I THINK IT IS COMMUNICATION IT'S JUST OOPSY
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER UH ACTUALLY I I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER HOW THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WORKS IN THE RUSSIAN COUNTRIES THE REPUBLICS YOU KNOW
REALLY THAT'S GOOD
IN A WAY  YOU KNOW UH SOMETHING WE COMPETE WITH
UH
AND I'VE BEEN SORT OF DISAPPOINTED HOW THAT THEY THEY SAY LITERACY RATE HAS GONE DOWN YOU KNOW
THAT'S SORT OF UPSETTING
TO THINK THAT WE'RE RICHER AND YET EVERYBODY IS INTELLECTUALLY POORER
IN OUR COUNTRY YEAH
THAT IS REALLY UPSETTING AND AND CONSIDERING IT'S FREE YOU KNOW
I MEAN GOOD EDUCATION IS REALLY STILL FREE
UH-HUH
YEAH UH-HUH
UH
UH-HUH
UH
SO HOW DO YOU RATE GUN CONTROL
I AGREE
UM-HUM
I AGREE
UM-HUM
OH MY GOSH
SO I GUESS THEY DON'T HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM OVER THERE HUH
YEAH
OH NO
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
THAT'S RIGHT
UM-HUM
WELL UM JUST RECENTLY I THINK IT WAS SUNDAY ON SIXTY MINUTES
THEY HAD AN ARTICLE UH OR UH
A NEWS STORY ABOUT UH GUN CONTROL AND IN FLORIDA THEY HAVE STARTED SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ONE TO BUY A GUN BUT UM THEY'VE STARTED WHERE THEY DO A BACKGROUND CHECK AND SO
AFT- YOU CAN GO APPLY FOR THIS GUN BUT IT TAKES LIKE SEVEN DAYS
UNTIL YOU CAN GET IT AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YOU KN- I'M NOT FOR TOTAL GUN CONTROL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BUT UM I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE BACKGROUND CHECK IS A GREAT IDEA
WAS IT BRADY YEAH
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
UH-HUH
SEE I THINK THAT'S GREAT BUT THEY ALSO SAID ON THIS UM NEWS STORY THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN SELL IT TO ONE ANOTHER
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THE BACKGROUND CHECK AND I MEAN THEY WENT ON TO TELL ABOUT ALL THE THE ILLEGAL GUNS AND EVERYTHING AND THAT I THINK THAT SIXTY MINUTES BOUGHT SOME GUNS AND UM
LIKE AN UZI EVEN AND
AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND PEOPLE WALK AROUND AT GUN SHOWS WITH THEIR BIG GUNS ON THEIR BACK SAYING FOR SALE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY BACKGROUND CHECKING I MEAN ANY THEY WOULD SELL IT TO ANYBODY
UH-HUH
ENOUGH MONEY THAT'S RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH THERE IS
OH REALLY
WELL UM MY DAD AND MY BROTHER BOTH HAVE A COLLECTION OF GUNS AND UM I DON'T KNOW I GUESS W- WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO GUNS BUT ACCIDENTS ALWAYS HAPPEN BUT MY DAD HAS ALWAYS KEE- KEPT HIS HID FROM US I MEAN EVEN TO THIS DAY I DON'T REALLY
RIGHT I KNOW WHERE HIS BIG GUN IS LIKE HIS SHOTGUN AND STUFF BUT UM
HIS PISTOLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND HE KEEPS THOSE HIDDEN AND IT IS JUST FOR OUR PROTECTION IT'S YOU KNOW IF WE DID HAVE A PROWLER HE HE KEEPS IT LIKE UM HE HAS THE LITTLE ROTARY DIAL THING AND LIKE
I THINK IT'S THE SECOND SHOT OR THE THIRD SHOT THE BULLET'S IN THERE BUT I MEAN HE'LL GIVE THEM TWO CHANCES
AND UM
RIGHT
YEAH
HIS WIFE
THAT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE OFTEN TOO
HUH-UH
OH MY GOSH
THAT'S RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH BECAUSE SHE MIGHT BE UM APT TO GO GET IT A LITTLE QUICKER THAN
UH-HUH
OH NO
YEAH
YEAH REALLY IF IT LANDED ON HER PILLOW BESIDE HER IF SHE HAD UH JUST ROLLED OVER
OH MY GOSH
YEAH I DO TOO
UM I THINK I WOULD RATE PROBABLY A SEVEN
JUST BECAUSE UM YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT IF WE DID BAN THEM THE BAD GUYS WOULD STILL HAVE THEM
I MEAN
PROBABLY LIKE THE COUNTRY MALAYSIA IS THAT WHERE YOU SAID I MEAN THEY STARTED IT
OH REALLY
NO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
WE GO
WELL I THINK UH I THINK ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN I WOULD BE I WOULD BE MORE TOWARD A UH A UH UH AN
A STAND THAT WOULD NOT TOTALLY BAN GUNS BUT WOULD CERTAINLY VERY MUCH CONTROL THEM UH
YEAH I THINK THAT UH
UH AND AND YOU KNOW I- I SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M COMING FROM A I'M COMING FROM MY MY UH UH MY P- MY PARENTS AND RELATIVES IN MASSACHUSETTS ARE ALL AVID GUN OWNERS MY DAD'S GOT A BIG COLLECTION
UH MY BROTHER'S GOT A COLLECTION THERE THEY BOTH UH DO POLICE WORK UH THEY GO OUT AN- SHOOT AN-
THEY'RE FROM THE MENTALITY THAT WHEN UH UH GUNS WERE AGAINST THE LAW ONLY CRIMINALS OWNED THEM THAT SORT OF THING
BUT I UH UH I- I THINK IT'S FAR TOO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GET GUNS
UH LET ME LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE A LITTLE MORE OF OF MY BACKGROUND WHERE I'VE REALLY COME TO THIS POSITION I- I AS I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE UH WE LIVED IN MALAYSIA FOR FOUR YEARS
AND IT UH I TELL YOU HOW AGAINST THE LAW GUNS OR ANY KIND OF FIREARMS ARE UH IT'S A HANGING OFFENSE
TO HAVE A GUN THERE'S TWO OFFENSES THAT ARE HANGING ONE IS TO HAVE A GUN AND THE OTHER IS TO IS TO DEAL IN NARCOTICS AND AND THERE'S NO APPEAL ONCE YOU'RE FOUND GUILTY THE SENTENCE IS AUTOMATIC
UH WELL IT'S INTERESTING THEY DO UH WELL THEY DO AND THEY DON'T NOT LIKE WE DO HERE YOU CAN'T BUY IT OFF THE STREET CORNERS BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY TO BE MADE IN DRUGS
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES NOT FOR SELLING IN MALAYSIA BUT PEOPLE GO TO THAILAND AND THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM THROUGH THE AIRPORT THERE THE LAST TWO PEOPLE THAT GOT HUNG WEREN'T EVEN TRYING TO SELL THEM THERE THEY WERE JUST UH CAUGHT WITH THEM
AND AND AND THE UH THE LAW SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN QUANTITY ON YOU YOU'RE PRESUMED TO BE A DEALER
UH IF YOU'RE A USER THE PENALTY ISN'T MUCH MUCH LESS YOU GO TO REHABILITATION IF YOU'RE A DEALER THEN YOU GET HUNG BUT ANYWAY UH THEY
THEY HAVE SOME VERY STRONG ANTIGUN LAWS THERE AND AND UH LIKE IT'S A HANGING OFFENSE
NOW UH YEAH PEOPLE GET BROKEN INTO AND THEY GET SLASHED UP WITH KNIVES BUT AT LEAST THE PERSON HAS TO BE NEXT TO YOU WITH A KNI- I MEAN YOU CAN OUTRUN A KNIFE BUT YOU CAN'T OUTRUN A GUN
SO UH THE VIOLENT UH THERE IS NOT AS MANY PEOPLE GETTING KILLED IN ROBBERIES AND HOLDUPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AS YOU SEE HERE
UH THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I'VE COME TO THAT TO THAT WAY OF THINKING OF COURSE THE UH THE VERY EMOTIONAL UH THINKING OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO PRESIDENT REAGAN YOU KNOW THE GUY THAT GOT IT WAS MENTALLY DERANGED SINCE YOU GET ONE SO EASILY
UH BUT I'M SURE THAT THEY GET A LOT OF PUBLICITY THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GET SHOT WITH GUNS BY EQUALLY MENTALLY DERANGED PEOPLE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK IT'S A I- I THINK IT'S GREAT AND I'M TRYING TO THINK THE UH SECRET SERVICE AGENT THAT GOT UH INJURED SO BADLY WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT PRESIDENT REAGAN
BRADY AND THIS IS THE LAW THAT'S BEFORE THE THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IS IS REFERRED TO AS THE BRADY BILL RIGHT
YEAH AND AND THAT REQUIRES SOME THAT WOULD BE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND REQUIRE SOME WAITING PERIOD PRESUMABLY UH DURING THAT WAITING PERIOD THERE WOULD BE A BACKGROUND UH UH CHECK THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
WE YOU KNOW I WONDER I HAD OCCASION TO GO INTO A PAWNSHOP RECENTLY I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ONE IN MY LIFE BEFORE AND UH I WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND AND AND THE MAJORITY OF WHAT THEY'VE GOT IN THERE ARE GUNS
AND I'LL BET THEY DON'T I'LL BET YOU DON'T I- I WOULD IMAGINE LEGITIMATE GUN DEALERS YOU'D HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS BUT I'LL BET IF SOMEBODY GOES IN AND OFFERS A PAWNSHOP
GUY SOME MONEY FOR A GUN
HE HE JUST PICKS IT UP OVER THE COUNTER
AND AND I WAS I WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT THERE YOU CAN GET GUNS OF ANY KIND THAT YOU WANT YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING IS YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT THE UH
NEEDING A GUN TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOU KNOW MAYBE SOMEDAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET WIPED OUT BY A ROBBER HERE AND THEN I'LL CHANGE MY MIND BUT
THERE'S SO MANY ACCIDENTS WITH CHILDREN ACCIDENTALLY GETTING A HOLD OF GUNS
UH WITH THE HUSBAND BEING OUT AT NIGHT AND THE WIFE HEARING RUSTLING AT THE DOOR HE FORGOT HIS KEY WHAM HE'S GONE UH I- I ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT ONE IN MY HOUSE FOR THAT REASON
UH THERE'S JUST TOO MANY THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN THAT ARE BAD
YEAH
OH SURE
YEAH
YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS
YEAH
YEAH
OH OKAY THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING THING SO UH YEAH THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT WOULD BE A DISADVANTAGE IF THE OTHER GUY'S GOT A GUN AND FIRES WHEN HE SEES HIS AND IT'S ON IT'S ON THE FIRST SHOT UH I THINK THAT UH UH
YEAH I- I- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR HAVING THEM THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEM THAT DON'T HAVE LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR HAVING THEM AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CRIMES OF PASSION
UH YOU KNOW A GUY MAY HAVE ONE AT HOME FOR HIS PROTECTION BUT SUDDENLY UH UH YEAH WIFE OR HE GETS IN AN ARGUMENT WITH A NEIGHBOR AND HE GOES HOME PARTICULARLY WHEN WE GET INTO THE HOT SUMMERS AND
OH SURE HE GOES HOME AND GETS HIS GUN OUT AND COMES BACK AND SHOOT THEM THERE WAS A UH
UH JUST RECENTLY HERE IN DALLAS I'M I'M TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT IT SOMEBODY JUMPED IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY IN LINE IN FRONT OF A SEVEN ELEVEN
AND THEY GOT MAD AND THEY HAD A LITTLE ARGUMENT OVER IT SO THIS ONE GUY GOES HOME AND HE IS SITTING TALKING TO HIS HIS UH
UH BROTHER ABOUT IT AND HE SEES THE GUY THAT JUMPED THE LINE IN FRONT OF HIM COMING DOWN THE STREET SO THEY GOT OUT AND HAVE MORE WORDS AND THE SECOND PARTY WENT DOWN TO HIS HOUSE SEVERAL HOUSES DOWN THE STREET AND GOT A GUN AND COME BACK AND SHOT THE OTHER GUY AND KILLED HIM
AND AND AND WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE LIKE THAT PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY WOULDN'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT BUT MOMENTARILY FLY OFF THE TRIGGER
TEND TO UH UH UH UH TEND TO DO THAT AND THEN IT HAPPENS IN THE IN THE CITIES A LOT IT HAPPENS IN UH UH I- I GUESS
AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR TEMPERS GROW SHORT
AND AND IT HAPPENS THEN AND I- I UH UH
YOU YOU KNOW MY UH UH OLDEST DAUGHTER'S FIANCE IS A UH IS A PART PART HE'S A COLLEGE PROFESSOR BUT HE ALSO IS A RESERVE POLICE OFFICER
AND AND HE UH HE HAS ALL KINDS OF GUNS AND HE'S TAKEN HER OUT TO TEACH HER TO SHOOT
AND UH UH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE SHE'S NOT AFRAID OF THEM AND IT IT TEACHES HER TO BE RESPONSIBLE RELATIVE TO GUNS BUT UH WHEN HE'S OUT ON POLICE WORK YOU KNOW HE LEAVES HER HOME ALONE AND SHOWS THEM WHERE THEY ARE
IN CASE SHE NEEDS THEM AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT I WOULD ALMOST WORRY ABOUT THAT MORE THAN IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE
SEE WHAT I MEAN YEAH
UH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEARS AGO I LIVED IN AN APARTMENT AND ONE NIGHT I HEARD WHAM AND BOY IT SHOCK THE APARTMENT
AND UH I CAME OUT AND SOME GIRLS CAME FLYING OUT OF THEIR APARTMENT
UH NEXT TO ME AND THEY ASKED ME TO COME IN AND LOOK AND THERE WAS CHIPS OF WOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE
AND A BIG HOLE IN THE CEILING AND A BULLET COMES TO REST ON THE PILLOW BESIDE ONE THEM'S HEAD
EVIDENTLY IT HAD RICOCHETED AROUND THE ROOM WELL A YOUNG BOY TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS OLD UH WAS LIVING WITH HIS DAD IN THE APARTMENT UP ABOVE AND HIS DAD'S GIRLFRIEND WAS VISITING AND THE DAD TOOK THE GIRLFRIEND HOME
AND APPARENTLY THE BOY HAD UH HE HAD A GUN IN THERE FOR PROTECTION SO THE BOY WAS BORED IT WAS A THREE FIFTY SEVEN MAGNUM AND HE WAS SITTING THERE SPINNING THE CHAMBER
AND IT WENT OFF AND ACTUALLY SHOT HIS TOE OFF AND WENT THROUGH THE CEI- UH THROUGH THE HIS FLOOR WHICH WAS THE CEILING OF THE APARTMENT BELOW THAT AND I SAY RICOCHETED AROUND THE ROOM A LITTLE BIT
IT WAS KIND OF SCARY
YEAH AND IT IT IT HAD ABOUT SPENT ALL IT'S ENERGY BUT YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS SPLINTERED WOOD FROM ALL THE PLACES THAT IT HIT GOING AROUND THE ROOM
AND AND UH SO I- I UH I- I THINK WE'RE ALMOST COMING FROM THE SAME PLACE ON THIS SUBJECT REALLY
I- I- I- I THINK THAT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE EXTREME OF BANNING THEM COMPLETELY BUT WE SURE WANT A LOT OF CONTROL THEN AND A LOT OF PROTECTION
YEAH I THINK I WOULD TOO I THINK I WOULD TOO
YEAH  BE UH WELL IT'S TOO LATE H- HEY IF I WERE STARTING MY OWN COUNTRY FROM THE BEGINNING

NAH SO IT'S SORT OF AN OLD WIFE OR COMMON FOLK TALES ABOUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CAT SPAYED LET IT GO THROUGH HEAT FIRST NOT TRUE BECAUSE WHEN THEY GO INTO HEAT THEIR UH
GENETIC PARTS SWELL UP AND EXPAND AND EVERYTHING AND THEN ONCE YOU DO TAKE THEM INTO SURGERY IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT EASIER TO HAVE THEM SPAYED BEFORE THEY EVEN GO INTO HEAT
BUT BUT WHEN THEY FIRST GO INTO HEAT UH THAT'S THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO BREED THEM ESPECIALLY THE PUREBREDS

UM-HUM
UH WE'RE GOING TO BREED HER WITH A CHAMPION SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET UH PROBABLY AROUND TWO FIFTY FOR THE KITTENS
I GUESS I DON- DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT
THE EXACT UH SPECIFICATIONS ARE FOR TEXAS I KNOW THAT THEY UH HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR CERTAIN CRIMES AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT IS
IS UH IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE CRIME THAT'S COMMITTED MY BELIEF ALL MY LIFE I GUESS HAS BEEN THAT
THAT IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY ARE GIVING UP UH YOURS IN PLACE OF IT
BUT I DON'T SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THAT
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS  WELL THERE'S THERE'S PROBABLY TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF VIEWS AS FAR AS THE CONTROVERSY GOES I CAN SEE WHERE
IF A LIFE WAS TAKEN BY ACCIDENT OR UH  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D CALL IT NOT PREMEDITATED OR I GUESS PRIMARILY BY ACCIDENT
UH THERE MAY BE CASES WHERE THE DEATH PENALTY IS NOT CALLED FOR
BUT I LEAN TOWARDS IF IT'S PREMEDITATED OR IF IT'S UH
KIND OF A HABITUAL OR OR A HABIT THAT UH A TENDENCY THAT PEOPLE UH MAY GET INTO THEN I GUESS I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT AGGRAVATES A LOT OF PEOPLE IS SOMEBODY DOES GET A LIFE SENTENCE IN PLACE OF THE DEATH PENALTY AND THEY WIND UP BACK ON THE STREETS AFTER FIVE YEARS OR SIX YEARS OR LIKE THE KID ON THE NEWS TONIGHT OUT IN MESQUITE WHO WAS OUT IN SIX MONTHS
NO
RIGHT
NO IT'S NOT YOU THINK OF YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING THE DEATH PENALTY AFTER CRE UH COMMITTING A CRIME ARE REALLY PRETTY SLIM RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN PROBABLY SPEND UH A LOT OF TIME
UH OR MAYBE EVENTUALLY UH JUST WAITING IT OUT AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF AGGRAVATION COMES I THINK IS IS UH THESE GUYS SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN THE APPEAL PROCESS OR JUST IN THE WAITING PROCESS THEY MAY SPEND YEARS
AND YOU KNOW THE LAST I HEARD IT WAS COSTING TEN TWENTY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR UH TO KEEP THESE GUYS WAITING
YEAH
TO YEAH TO CARRY IT OUT IT SORT OF TAKES THE JUSTICE OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
YEAH
IT SHOULD BE OVER AND DONE WITH
YEAH IT IS AND SHE WINDS UP BEING A A VICTIM DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY
RIGHT SH-
SHE IS SHE IS AN EMOTIONAL VICTIM
AND YOU KNOW THE LIKE YOU SAY THE COPS THAT ARE OUT DOING THE WORK A DAY BY DAY HAVE GOT TO HAVE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION WHEN THEY SEE ALL THEIR WORK BASICALLY GO OUT THE WINDOW
YES THEY ARE
WELL THAT'S ABOUT FIVE MINUTES SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE WELL
IT'S A PLEASURE TALKING WITH YOU
OKEYDOKE GOOD-BYE
YEAH UH UH I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU UH YOU KNOW PROBABLY PRETTY SIMILAR VIEWS ON IT BUT THAT'S
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IS SO MUCH OF THE CONTROVERSY BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW I- I DO ALSO MYSELF BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UH
UH YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY IRKS ME TO SEE SO MUCH EFFORT PUT INTO PREVENTING SOMEONE BEING PUT TO DEATH BY THE STATE WHEN THEY
SO CALLOUSLY AND USUALLY SO YOU KNOW WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OR WITHOUT ANY CONCERN UH YOU KNOW END SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE AND IN A LOT OF CASES SEVERAL PEOPLE'S LIVES
OH IS THAT
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY I FEEL I- IF YOU'VE GOT A GUY WHO'S
WHO'S BEEN TO TRIAL AND HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL YOU KNOW BASICALLY A A THREE TIME LOSER FOR THE TWELFTH TIME YOU KNOW AND HE GOES OUT AND KILLS SOMEBODY HE'S NOT GOING TO BE REFORMED HE'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT GOING A
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER AND AND THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THE OPINION THAT
YOU KNOW DON'T DON'T HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT GIVE THEM LIFE IN JAIL AND YOU KNOW I COULD GO ALONG WITH THAT IF IF I COULD BE ASSURED THAT IT WOULD BE THEIR NATURAL LIFE IN JAIL AND NOT PAROLE AFTER TEN OR TWELVE YEARS
UM-HUM YEAH IT'S IT'S JUST
OUR CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS JUST SO I GUESS OVERLOADED BUT THE YOU KNOW THE THE PROBLEM IS NOT
SO MUCH WITH THE PRISON SYSTEM YOU KNOW I MEAN BECAUSE THE THE COPS ARE OUT THERE DOING THEIR JOB ENFORCING THE LAWS AND THE PRISON SYSTEM ARE JUST YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO COPE WITH THEM BUT
YOU KNOW THE THING ABOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I- I YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A DETERRENT UH TO TO FUTURE CRIME AND THE WAY IT IS NOW IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU
IF THE LIKE THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE MAY
UH YOU KNOW MAY EXECUTE SOMEBODY TWICE A YEAR YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S NO KIND OF DETERRENT BECAUSE WE WE'VE GOT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW AND AND MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR LITERALLY FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS ON DEATH ROW AND THAT'S
THAT'S CERTAINLY NO KIND OF DETERRENT AND I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH ANYBODY WHO SAYS RIGHT NOW THAT IT IT'S NOT A DETERR- UH A DETERRENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT
OH YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH IT IT'S AMAZING THERE'S UH THERE'S A GIRL I WORK WITH OUR SECRETARY AS A MATTER OF FACT HER HER FATHER WAS MURDERED HER FATHER AND THREE OTHER GUYS UP HERE IN SHERMAN
AND THE UH THE GUY THAT THEY TRIED AND CONVICTED AND SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH YOU KNOW HE'S BEEN ON DEATH ROW FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS
AND YOU KNOW THIS THIS WAS HER FATHER UH YOU KNOW THAT THAT GOT KILLED YOU KNOW JUST COLD-BLOODED MURDER HIM AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE AND BUT STILL
FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW THIS THIS GUY'S SENTENCE HAS NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT YOU KNOW HE'S SITTING ON DEATH ROW FOR EIGHT YEARS AFTER HAVING KILLED FOUR PEOPLE AND THE STATE STILL CAN'T BRING ITSELF TO TO EX- EXECUTE THIS GUY
IT DOES IT REALLY DOES YOU KNOW SHE AND THEY HAVE TO GO BACK UH OCCASIONALLY YOU KNOW SHE HAS TO WRITE LETTERS TO THE PAROLE BOARD AND YOU KNOW LAWYERS AND
JUST JUST EVER SO OFTEN SHE MENTIONS WELL SHE'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW WRITE ANOTHER LETTER OR DO SOMETHING IT'S JUST
YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD BE GETTING ON WITH HER LIFE YOU KNOW GETTING GETTING THAT PART BEHIND HER BUT YET
IT'S IT'S KIND OF TIED TO HER THE WAY IT IS NOW
YEAH  YEAH RIGHT A VICTIM NOT ONLY OF UH INDIRECTLY OF THE CRIME BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY BY THAT INDIRECT INVOLVEMENT IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S RIDICULOUS
YEAH YEAH IT IT'S TERRIBLE YOU KNOW AND
YEAH
OH THAT OH MAN I- I COULDN'T BE A COP FOR THAT FOR THAT VERY REASON YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY DO THE THE CRIMINAL GETS RIGHT BACK OUT AND YOU KNOW THE COP'S JUST GOT TO GO BACK AND
AND DO HIS THING ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE CRIMES ARE ARE DONE BY REPEAT OFFENDERS IT'S
YEAH
NO
ALL RIGHT RON WE'LL SEE YOU LATER ALL RIGHT BYE-BYE
WELL ON THIS SUBJECT OF INVASION OF PRIVACY YES IT'S VERY EASY FOR ANYBODY TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOU
YOUR
YEAH UH THE SPECIAL ON CHANNEL THIRTEEN THAT WAS BROADCAST I THINK LAST WEEK OR SO AGO IT DETAILED HOW THIS ONE PERSON WENT ABOUT
FINDING OUT THIS PARTICULAR PERS- FROM THIS PARTICULAR PERSON HIS HOME MORTGAGE HOW MUCH HE PAYS FOR IT WHAT HIS PAYMENTS ARE
UH HIS UH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER DRIVER'S LICENSE ANY KIND OF RECORDS HE MAY HAVE UH THEIR CREDIT CARD AND THE STATUS OF THEIR CREDIT
IT WAS JUST AS A DEMONSTRATION TO SHOW
THOSE WHO WERE WATCHING IT HOW EASILY OBTAINABLE INFORMATION IS ON ANY SINGLE PERSON
AND IT WAS MOSTLY IT DEALT WITH UH MARKETING COMPANIES THESE UH DIRECT MARKETING
ASSOCIATIONS THAT WAS THE PRIMARY SUBJECT THAT'S HOW THEY OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY
AND GROUP THEM INTO AGE BRACKETS UH THEIR HABITS THEIR HOBBIES THEIR INCOME
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH ALL THE MANIPULATIONS OF THE COMPUTER
UM-HUM
THE OPEN OFFICE
YEAH
NOT INSOFAR AS MAYBE MAKING CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY I S- SUPPOSE BECAUSE IT YOU CAN EASILY BE OVERHEARD OVERHEARD
AND THEY GET I SUPPOSE ANY ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE LAYING OUT CAN BE EASILY SEEN
YEAH THERE'S THERE IS
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
DO YOU WORK WITH UH MIXED COMPANY MALE AND FEMALE OR
WELL THERE THERE ARE A FEW OUT THERE
IT'S I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR AND WHERE AT
BUT UM
MY OWN ENVIRONMENT IS OPEN TOTALLY THERE ARE NO CUBICLES
THERE'S NOTHING TO BLOCK ANYTHING
SO YEAH BUT UM I GUESS WE'RE CHANGING EVER SO RAPIDLY IN THE DEVICES OF
COMMUNICATIONS THAT ANYTHING CAN BE OBTAINED FROM ANYBODY'S RECORD OR
THE COMPUTER IS THE
THE BIG ADVENT OF THAT I BELIEVE BECAUSE IT THEY CAN ALL HOLD SUCH LARGE DATA BASES ON ANYBODY THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH A BUTTON AND IT APPEARS
IN FRONT OF THEM AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO I- I KNOW THE GOVERNMENT SELLS INFORMATION TO PRIVATE COMPANIES ABOUT INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES
THAT'S NO SECRET AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY I DON'T THINK
I MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE I'LL TELL YOU THAT
SO
UH THE ONLY WAY IT CAN CHANGE IS UM
IF IF EVERYBODY BANDS TOGETHER IT'S JUST LIKE WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE CLOWNS THAT'S SERVING IN THE OFFICE
THE ONLY THING REALLY THAT CAN BE CHANGED IS FOR US TO EVERYBODY TO SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU OUT YOU GO BUT
UH I DON'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO OCCUR UNLESS EVERYBODY BANDS TOGETHER TO DO THAT IT HAS TO BE ONE COMMON IDEAL GOAL FOR THAT TO BE DONE UM
I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S STILL A A FREE I SUPPOSE COUNTRY INSOFAR AS WE'RE WE'RE ABLE TO
OBTAIN INFORMATION AND I WOULDN'T BE FOR TOTAL BANNING OF
UH ALL INFORMATION OR IT'S MOSTLY THE PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT BUT IT'S IT'S HARD TO DEFINE
UH A LOT OF THOSE BOUNDARIES
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
SO YOU'VE RECEIVED A LOT OF UH FLACK
UM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
IS THAT USUALLY WHAT YOU TELL THEM IN THE LETTER
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
GOOD IDEA
UM-HUM
OH THAT'S GOOD
ANY OTHER PROBLEMS
YEAH  I
I GUESS I'VE JUST ABOUT RUN OUT OF
I- I CAN PROBABLY GO ON BUT
IT'S IT'S UH I'M CLOUDING UP RIGHT NOW
WELL IT'S NICE TALKING TO YOU
MAYBE AGAIN
BYE-BYE
WELL I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT VERY MUCH
WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT ALL THAT STUFF
OH
OH YEAH UM-HUM
UM
THAT'S NOT REALLY GOOD I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THAT'S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S AN EVERYDAY THING THOUGH AT LEAST NOT FOR YOU KNOW AN INDIVIDUAL
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL IS A IS A PRETTY MUCH AN INVASION OF PRIVACY IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY SO COMMON THAT IT'S ACCEPTED AS THE NORM NOW IS THE OP- THE OPEN OFFICE CONCEPT
UH-HUH WHERE THEY HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE LITTLE PARTITION DIVIDERS THROUGHOUT A A LARGE ROOM AND AND PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE CUBICLES WELL THAT'S ALL FINE AND GOOD BUT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY PRIVACY AT ALL
RIGHT
YEAH
AND AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST THAT IT'S UH THE WHOLE THING ABOUT YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCENTRATE WELL IT'S RATHER HARD SOMETIMES IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO
BECAUSE UM
YOU KNOW YOU'RE UH YOU'RE TIME
AND YOU'RE SPACE IS IS NOT YOUR OWN SPACE
AND I'VE WORK IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT AND I
WELL KIND OF HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT
OH YEAH IS THERE ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T
YEAH
HM
YES
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT'S QUITE RIGHT EITHER
YEAH
HM
WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT
YEAH
IT REALLY IS IT'S SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING THAT I'VE JUST HAD A
A DEALING WITH IS LIKE A CREDIT BUREAU
WELL THEY TAKE THEY TAKE MY NAME WHICH IS A VERY COMMON NAME AND MY LAST NAME IS EVEN MORE COMMON
AND THEY THEY CHECK THAT NAME AGAINST UH THEIR LIST AND THEY FIND SEVERAL
AND WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING TO TRY TO MATCH UP ANY OTHER INFORMATION AT ALL THEY JUST REPORT EVERYTHING UNDER THAT NAME
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T EVEN CHECK MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
AND COMPANIES ARE PAYING THEM GOOD MONEY TO REPORT ACCURATELY AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE SO LAZY THEY'RE JUST NOT DOING IT I MEAN THEY JUST FIND YOUR NAME AND THEY MATCH IT UP
YOU KNOW AND THAT THAT JUST DRIVES ME CRAZY BECAUSE THEY'RE AND THEN THEY WANT THEN YOU KNOW TO GET IT REMOVED THEY SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WRITE THIS
WRITE THIS LONG DETAILED LETTER AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT TO THEM YOU KNOW AND THEN IT TAKES THREE WEEKS AND ALL AND I'M LIKE BALONEY
YOU MESSED IT UP YOU FIX IT
NO WHAT I'VE TAKEN TO DOING LATELY IS CALLING THE COMPANY THAT THEY REPORT
LIKE UH UH RECENTLY I WAS REPORTED AS HAVING JC PENNEY ACCOUNTS AND I DON'T
SO I CALLED JC PENNEY AND I SAID UH I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE CREDIT AGENCY YOU'RE USING IS INCORRECTLY REPORTING THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING TO THEM
AND THEY SAY UH-HUH BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR SERVICES THAT'S NOT BEING DONE PROPERLY EITHER SO THEN THEY CAN CALL
THE CREDIT BUREAU AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WE'RE PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY TO REPORT THIS PROPERLY AND YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB
SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE TAKEN TO DOING LATELY AND IT SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL SO FAR
NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF
YES
OH YEAH PROBABLY BETTER LET YOU GET BACK TO WORK
OKAY
ALRIGHTY BYE-BYE
ALL RIGHT

AND THIS YEAR I DECIDED THAT WELL MY HUSBAND MADE A LITTLE GARDEN
OUT THERE WITH THE TOMATOES AND STUFF IN IT BUT I DECIDED THAT I DON'T LIKE GRASS I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO PULL GRASS
SO I DECIDED THAT I WOULD PLANT ME A TOMATO PLANT IN A FLOWER POT
TO GO SEE HOW IT WORKED
YEAH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
OH
I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I COULD PROBABLY PLANT ONE AND BRING IT IN AND JUST LIKE I BRING MY PLANTS IN EVERY YEAR
THAT'D BE NEAT WELL I GOT A PATIO AND
I TRIED TO TALK MY HUSBAND INTO JUST BUYING A WHOLE BUNCH OF POTS  AND PLANTING THEM ALL IN IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S MY FAVORITE THING IS TOMATOES TO GROW
AND SO UM BUT HE SAID NO HE WAS GOING TO PLANT IN THE EARTH YOU KNOW LIKE HE ALWAYS HAS BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS HAD A GARDEN OUT IN THE COUNTRY
AND I THINK HE KIND OF MISSES IT A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW SINCE WE MOVED TO THE CITY BUT UM
I WENT AHEAD AND PLANTED ONE AND MINE LOOKS BETTER THAN HIS
IT DOES AND THEN I LIKE UM YOU KNOW WHAT DAYLILIES ARE
DAYLILIES
UH-HUH THAT BITE YOU
NO NO HUM-UM THESE LOOK LIKE A LILY THEY LOOK LIKE A UM WELL THEY REALLY LOOK LIKE AN ORCHID
WHEN THEY COME OUT UH-HUH THAT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE BUT THEY ONLY BLOOM FOR ONE DAY
THEY'LL UM YOU'LL HAVE A BUD THE EVENING BEFORE AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS THE SUN HITS IT IT OPENS IT STARTS OPENING UP AND THEN WHEN IT GETS DARK IT CLOSES AND THAT'S IT IT ONLY BLOOMS FOR ONE DAY
UH-HUH
YEAH BUT UM
THEY LOOK LIKE ORCHIDS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE BUT THEY LOOK LIKE DIFFERENT COLOR ONES LIKE I HAVE UH YELLOW ONES AND I HAVE RED ONES AND I HAVE PURPLE ONES AND THEN THEY HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW THE REAL VELVETY LOOKING STUFF INSIDE
IT IT LOOKS JUST LIKE ORCHIDS IN DIFFERENT COLORS THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY ARE THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL UH I HAD A FRIEND WHEN I LIVED OUT IN THE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD BELONGED TO THIS KIND OF SOCIETY THAT LIKE EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW OR EVERY SO MANY MONTHS THEY WOULD SEND YOU DIFFERENT BULBS THAT THEY CAME OUT WITH
AND I MEAN THEY WERE REAL EXPENSIVE THEY WERE LIKE WELL THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE THAT SHE GAVE ME A BULB FOR WAS LIKE THIRTY TWO FIFTY FOR ONE BULB
SO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IS SHE WOULD PLANT THEM AND THEY MULTIPLIED
SO THE NEXT YEAR WHEN SHE YOU KNOW WEEDED THEM OUT SO THEY WOULDN'T BE AS THICK THEN SHE'D GIVE ME SOME OF THE BULBS
AND I MEAN I HAVE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DAY LILIES THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN
SO WHEN WE DECIDED TO MOVE IT WAS REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS AND SO I KEPT SAYING WELL I WANT TO TAKE A FEW OF THESE AND I WANT TO TAKE THESE AND I WANT TO TAKE THESE
MY HUSBAND FINALLY SAID LOOK ARE WE GOING TO TAKE THE GRASS  I SAID YES WE MAY LEAVE THAT AND I HAD A TREE

THEY BOUGHT THE PLACE BUT UM I KNEW THAT THEY WOULD YOU KNOW IF I LEFT LIKE ONE BULB OF EACH ONE OF THEM BY THIS YEAR THEY'D HAVE TEN BULBS OF EACH ONE OF THEM
SO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS BIG RAW PLACE OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT WOULD COVER IT RIGHT UP

UH CLAUSTROPHOBIA I MEAN THAT'S JUST GOING TO TERRIFY HIM YOU KNOW AND
THAT'S TRUE BUT NO I MEAN THEY WERE UH I MEAN I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH PARENTS I THINK THAT IS A VERY WRONG WAY TO HANDLE UH DISCIPLINING A CHILD PUTTING THEM IN
I MEAN THEY WERE THEY WERE CALL- THEY CALLED THEM THEIR QUIET ROOMS OR THEIR ISOLATION ROOMS THEY DIDN'T CALL THEM CLOSETS BUT THEY SHOWED THESE ROOMS ON UH YOU KNOW ON THE NEWS AND I MEAN THEY LOOKED LIKE A CLOSET TO ME YOU KNOW WITH A DESK IN IT A REAL SMALL
BUT THEY SAID THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THEY CAME UP WITH WAS TO TAKE THE DOORS OFF OF THESE ISOLATION ROOMS
I SAID NOW WHAT GOOD DOES THI- I MEAN HOW IS THIS HELPING I MEAN EITHER WAY
YOU KNOW I I DEFINITELY HAD TO DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT IS
THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO HANDLE A CHILD YOU KNOW DISCIPLINE A CHILD BY PUTTING HIM IN A CLOSET
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEP UH
RIGHT
WELL
RIGHT
UH-HUH
I I DON'T
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
UH
WELL
UM I HAVE TO I THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS
I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF UH
IS NOT JUST DI- DISCIPLINE OKAY BUT OKAY FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DO AT UH MY KIDS SCHOOL UH THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL UH CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS
AND WHEN THE KIDS ARE IN HALLS AND STUFF AND IF THEY'RE BEING REALLY GOOD I MEAN JUST BEING EXCELLENT THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW CUTTING UP AND SO ON THEY'RE JUST STANDING IN LINE DOING WHATEVER THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO THEY GET ONE OF THESE CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS
AND THEN WHEN THEY COLLECT THEM AT THE END OF EACH WEEK THEY GET TO GO TO THIS LITTLE WHAT THEY CALL THEIR CAUGHT BEING GOOD STORE AND THEN THEY GET TO SPEND THESE LIKE MONEY
WELL SEE TO ME THAT'S POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT IS MUCH BETTER MUCH BETTER THAN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DISCIPLINE KIDS
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOOD AND TRY AND EARN THOSE THINGS
YOU KNOW TO GET THE POSITIVE PART OF IT I MEAN THEY'D RA- MUCH RATHER GO IN THE STORE AND BUY SOMETHING THAN BE SPANKED SO THEY'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO WORK TOWARDS BEING GOOD YOU KNOW RATHER THAN TRYING TO ACT UP AND BE BAD
YOU KNOW
YEAH
WELL THAT'S TRUE  I THINK I THINK REALLY THOUGH I MEAN THAT'S ONE THING THAT I MEAN MY KIDS DEFINITELY GET SPANKED WHEN THEY NEED THEY NEED TO BE SPANKED
BUT I REALLY DO TRY TO USE POSITIVE UH REINFORCEMENT WITH THEM AT HOME ALSO AND IT REALLY HELPS AND I MEAN THEY THEY DON'T GET SPANKED VERY OFTEN BUT
THEY THEY DO WHEN THEY DESERVE IT YOU KNOW BUT UH
I DON'T THINK ANY KID SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM BEING SPANKED
I MEAN I I THINK I WOULDN'T MIND IF A TEACHER SPANKED MY CHILD BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT LAW WILL EVER CHANGE
THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO LET A A TEACHER SPANK A CHILD AGAIN
BUT I DON'T THINK I MEAN SOME KIDS DON'T GET DON'T GET SPANKED AT HOME AND SOME KIDS NEED TO BE SPANKED AT HOME I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK
BUT I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT RIGHT WELL THERE'S SO MANY PARENTS THAT SAY YOU CAN DEAL WITH A CHILD WITHOUT SPANKING THEM WHICH IS TRUE YOU CAN BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A CHILD NEEDS TO BE SPANKED I MEAN THEY DO THINGS THAT THEY NEED THAT
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS
WELL EVERYBODY'S KNO- HAS KNOWN THEY'VE NEEDED RENOVATION FOR YEARS BUT NEVER REALLY HAD A CLEAR DIRECTION ON WHICH WAY TO GO WITH IT
THE FIRST DIRECTION THAT I CAN SEE
OR I WISH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM GO WITH
KIDS LEARN AT DIFFERENT RATES AND FOR TOO LONG THEY'VE KIND OF LUMPED EVERYBODY TOGETHER YOU'D LEARN AT THIS RATE AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YOU'VE GOT SOME KIDS THAT'LL PICK UP ON IT IN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND THE RE- THE OTHER FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A SUBJECT YOU'VE BORED THEM
THE EDUCATORS NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE
OPEN MINDED AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE IN DEALING WITH
UH THE VARIOUS STUDENTS
TO GET THE MAXIMUM
POTENTIAL OUT OF THE PERSON
OUT OF EACH CHILD SOME KIDS ARE GOING TO BE GREAT WITH MECHANICAL STUFF OTHER KIDS ARE GOING TO BE
REALLY INTO MATH SOME ARE REALLY GOING TO BE HEAVY INTO READING
INSTEAD OF
PUSHING THE SCALES TOO FAR EITHER DIRECTION
I MEAN IT'S GREAT TO BE WELL ROUNDED AND HAVE BE EXPOSED TO ALL THIS STUFF
BUT WHY NOT HIT THE POINTS THE KID'S REALLY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE IF HE'S INTERESTED HE'S GOING TO STUDY IT AND HE'S GOING TO LEARN IT AND HE'S GOING TO REMEMBER IT
THEY NEED EXPOSURE TO EVERY SUBJECT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE MASTERS OF IT
EVERYTHING I LEARNED ABOUT ANCIENT ROME HA- HAS NOT HELPED ME ANYWHERE IN MY ADULT LIFE
WHAT WHAT TYPE OF HISTORY CLASS IS IT THAT YOU'RE HAVING TO TAKE
WELL THE EARLY ONES
THEY COULD ACTUALLY COMBINE TWO TWO LEVELS OF IT THE ONE FROM SEVENTEEN HUNDRED -TIL
SAY THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR COMBINE THAT INTO ONE AND THEN FROM EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE TO PRESENT AND MAKE THAT YOUR SECOND STEP BECAUSE
TO A POINT TO A POINT THE BOTTOM YOU KNOW THE EARLY PARTS OF IT YOU'RE GIVING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NATION AND
BUT
EVEN THEN THEY'RE SKIMMING OVER THEY'RE VERY TRI- ALMOST TRIVIAL WITH IT
THEY WANT IF I MEAN IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET TO THE MEAT OF THE MATTER I MEAN THERE'S
THEY MAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE OUT TO BE OH THEY WERE GREAT MEN AND THEY'RE THE FATHER OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL THIS HE HAD JUST AS MUCH DIRT ON HIM AS ANYBODY ELSE IF NOT MORE
THE MAN WAS NOT A SAINT
IF IF THE ISOLATION CONCEPT REALLY WORKS THAT GOOD WHY ARE OUR PRISONS OVERCROWDED
TH- THE UM
AS A PART OF THE REVAMPING OF THE ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM ON THAT LEV- THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM I WANT TO SEE CHANGED TOO
WHEN I WAS BR- BROUGHT UP
IF YOU CROSSED THE LINE AND YOU BROKE A RULE BAD ENOUGH YOU WERE GOING TO GET SPANKED WELL THEN THE EXTREME CAME IN AND NOW WE CAN NO LONGER SPANK THEM SO WE NOW ISOLATE THEM
OKAY WE'VE SWUNG THE PENDULUM BOTH WAYS LET'S FIND A MIDDLE GROUND INSTEAD OF
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF DISCIPLINE AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT
SHORT OF PHYSICALLY ISOLATING THE CHILD AND SHORT OF PHYSICALLY HITTING THE CHILD
LET'S PUT HIM INTO A SITUATION WHERE OKAY YOU CROSSED THE LINE YOU BROKE THE RULE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT
BUT
IT'S GOING TO TAX YOU PHYSICALLY
HAVE TH- I MEAN
IN- INSTEAD HA- HAVE THEM PICK UP AROUND THE SCHOOL YARD HAVE THEM
WEED A FLOWER BED SOMEWHERE ON THE SCHOOL YAR- DO SOMETHING TO BEAUTIFY THE SCHOOL PROPERTY
BUT YOU CUT YOU KNOW THE THE KID'S HAVING TO GIVE UP HIS QUOTE PLAY TIME TO
PAY HIS DEBT FOR WHAT HE DID WRONG
BUT HE'S SEEING SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE COME OUT OF IT
I THINK THAT NOT ONLY APPLIES INSIDE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT IN SOCIETY ITSELF WE'VE BEEN TOO LONG THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT HOW MUCH
DAY LIKE
THE CAUGHT BEING GOOD SLIPS HOW ABOUT JUST THE JOHN Q CITIZEN OUT THERE ON THE STREET
I M- M- MOST WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE
I MEAN THERE'S A POINT OF OVER KILL BUT SOMEWHERE IN YOU'VE GOT TO FIND AN EVEN LINE
YEAH I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN LATELY I ME- WELL WELL
YEAH WE WE'VE SEEN THAT YEAH
YEAH IT WAS GREAT HAVE YOU SEEN IT

SO SCARY
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM UH-HUH
HUH
HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST IS THEY'RE THEY'RE SO UNSTABLE THAT SOMEBODY LIKE THAT COULD MAKE UH DECISIONS THAT WOULD
JEOPARDIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE
UH-HUH
YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COME CLOSE TO THAT AS IT IS
UH-HUH
YEAH
HUH
UH-HUH
NO I HAVEN'T
UH-HUH
YOU MEAN IN THE IN THE MOST RECENT CONFLICT
OH YEAH DEFINITELY I I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT SHOCKED TO WHAT THE US HAS DONE IN TERMS OF SELLING TO IRAQ
IN THE PAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS
YEAH I THINK WE WE KIND OF SHOOT OURSELVES IN THE FOOT THAT WAY TOO IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THE SOVIETS DO IT
UM UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S SCARY TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE SUPPLYING THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH WEAPONS
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S TO THE SOUTH OF US
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL I THINK RUSSIA IS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET OUT OF COMMUNISM I GUESS I'D WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY LIKE YELTSIN
TO GET MORE POWER I THINK GORBACHEV HAS ABOUT HAD HIS DAY
YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH TRUE
I DON'T KNOW I SURE WOULDN'T TURN MY BACK ON THEM
UH-HUH
AT LEAST THEY'RE LEARNING A LITTLE BIT FROM HISTORY I MEAN UH
OKAY DO I STILL CAN- STILL CAN FEEL THAT THE SOVIET UNION AS SUCH IS STILL A THREAT TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD ABSOLUTELY
AND MY REASONS ARE BASED UPON NOT ONLY FROM WHAT I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT I SEE ON THE NEWSPAPERS BUT UP AGAINST SOME OF THE
FUN AND EXCITING THINGS I RAN INTO DURING MY SIX YEARS AS A SOLDIER IN THE FIFTH SPECIAL FORCES GROUP
WELL THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT A POWDER KEG
THE UM
I'LL GO BACK IN TIME A LITTLE BIT TO ABOUT EIGHTY ONE
WHEN MY FIRST REAL INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MILITARY STARTED
UM
NATURALLY WE WERE AT THE TIME THE SOVIET UNION WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BIG MILITARY POWER AND THE BIG THREAT SO WE GOT LOTS QUITE A BIT OF
INFORMATION AS WELL AS INDOCTRINATION ON SOVIET TACTICS AND WEAPONS
I WENT TO LEBANON IN EIGHTY THREE BEFORE THE MARINES EVER GOT THERE WITH THE UN PEACE KEEPING FORCE
AND WITH THE TRAINING I RECEIVED PRIOR TO GOING THERE WITH CAPTURED WEAPONS WE KEPT RUNNING UP AGAINST
THESE WEREN'T THESE WEREN'T CHINESE MADE COPIES THESE WERE SOVIET MADE TOP OF THE LINE FRESH OUT OF THE BOX AK-47S
AS WELL AS A LOT OF THE EXPLOSIVES WE WERE RUNNING INTO
IN GRANADA IN OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTY THREE WE INVADED THE PLACE
SURE THERE WERE CUBAN SOLDIERS THERE BUT THERE WAS ALSO A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN ADVISORS THAT WERE DAMN GOOD SHOTS
THE TEAM I WAS WITH WE JUMPED IN ON THE WESTERN TIP OF OF THE ISLAND DOWN ON POINT SALINAS
AND FOR EVERY CUBAN THERE WAS AT LEAST FIVE RUSSIAN ADVISORS
AND THEY WERE ALL SHOOTING STATE OF THE ART SOVIET WEAPONS
IN EIGHTY FOUR
I WAS DOWN IN CENTRAL AMERICA AS AN ADVISOR TO THE HONDURAN ARMY
AGAIN WE WERE RUNNING UP AGAINST CUBANS QUITE A BIT PLUS SOVIET ADVISORS
AND THE EQUIPMENT WE WERE CAPTURING AND TAKING FROM THE NICARAGUANS WAS BRAND NEW OUT OF THE CRATE SOVIET MADE MATERIAL
DO I CONSIDER THEM A THREAT ABSOLUTELY
THEY HAVE A UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW CALLED THE PATRICE DE LAMUMBA UNIVERSITY
ABOUT LIKE A AND M OR UT WHERE THEY'RE TEACHINGS SUBJECTS LIKE THAT THEY'RE TEACHING TERRORISM
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE WENT UP AGAINST IN LEBANON WERE GRADUATES FROM THAT PLACE AND LET ME TELL YOU THEY ARE NOTHING NICE TO GO UP AGAINST
I'M SURPRISED DURING THIS IRAQI CRISIS WE DIDN'T HAVE MORE
INCIDENTS THAN THEY DID
THESE GUYS ARE TOP OF THE LINE
WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THERE
THEY CAN PULL TERRORIST ACTIONS ANYWHERE IN THE FREE WORLD
AND THEY ARE VERY VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO
SO UNTIL I SEE THE ENTIRE
QUOTE OLD GUARD
OF THE SOVIET MILITARY OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
COMPLETELY ROLL OVER AND DISAPPEAR PREFERABLY BURIED
I STILL CONSIDER THEM A THREAT
THEIR MILITARY IS DIFFERENT FROM OURS TO WHERE THERE ARE EXTREMIST GEN- GENERALS THAT ACTUALLY CONTROL TENS AND THOUSANDS
OF TROOPS
THAT IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT SOVIET POLICY IS THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THE GENERAL TELLS THEM
WELL IT'S IN- INTERESTING WATCHING THE DIFFERENT SOVIET STATES ALBANIA LITHUANIA
DOING THEIR LITTLE REVOLTS DOWN THERE
EACH ONE OF THOSE SECTORS HAS GOT A SOVIET GENERAL OVER THE TROOPS THAT ARE THERE
SO FAR THEY HADN'T RUN INTO THE REAL PSYCHOS YET
THERE'S PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX WHICH WOULD BE AN EQUIVALENT OF OUR JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFFS THAT ARE IN POSITIONS OVER SOME OF THESE SOVIET STATES
IF UPRISINGS HA- HAPPEN IN THEIR SECTORS
IT IS IT'S GOING TO BE A TOTAL BLOOD BATH
ACTUALLY THEY'RE SHOWING REMARKABLE RESTRAINT
THEY GET REAL NASTY THE HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS COME OUT AND THEY
WOULD LEVEL ENTIRE AREAS
OKAY YOU'RE FROM THE DALLAS AREA RIGHT
OKAY YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE SIZE OF UH THE AREA AROUND RICHARDSON
YOU PUT FIVE SOVIET HYUNDEE HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR THEY CAN LEVEL THE ENTIRE AREA AND THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT ALIVE
AND THEY CAN DO THAT IN ABOUT FOUR MINUTES
AND THEY'VE GOT ENTIRE SQUADRONS OF THOSE JUST STANDING BY
THEY USED THEM IN AFGHANISTAN DID RE- REMARKABLY WELL CONSIDERING THE TERRAIN THEY WERE FLYING IN
BUT ON A HIGHLY POPULATED AREA LIKE SOME OF THE SOVIET CITIES WOULD BE
WITH THE WEAPONRY THAT'S ATTACHED ON THOSE THINGS THERE IS NO PLACE TO HIDE
IF THE BOMBS DON'T GET YOU IF THE BULLETS DON'T GET YOU THEN THE THEN THE NERVE GAS DEFINITELY WILL GET YOU
THE ONLY DRAWBACK ON THAT LITTLE PIECE OF MACHINERY IS THEY ONLY GOT FIVE MINUTES OF AIR TIME
THEY DRINK THAT MUCH FUEL
WERE YOU HAVE YOU I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ANY TIME IN THE MILITARY
AS A CIVILIAN THAT'S NEVER BEEN ATTACHED TO ANY FORM OF THE MILITARY
I KNOW A LOT OF THIS STUFF THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN NEVER DID MAKE THE NEWSPAPERS BUT
DURING THAT SAME TIME FRAME DIDN'T YOU GET SOME FEELING THAT I MEAN THEY'RE GETTING ALL THESE WEAPONS AND STUFF
DIDN'T IT
IT BUG YOU A LITTLE BIT WHY THEY KEPT COMING UP WITH ALL THIS STUFF
IN ANY OF THEM SINCE EIGHTY ONE
IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO WHETHER IT'S OUR SIDE THEIR SIDE IT'S A MATTER OF MONEY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
THE DEAL THE IRAQI'S HAVE WITH THE RUSSIANS WAS FOR OIL
UH THE ONES TO THE SOUTH ARE MORE REGIONAL CONFLICT
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THAT WORRIED ABOUT
INVADING NORTH
THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN THEY'VE GOT A SCREWED UP SITUATION I'LL GIVE THEM THAT
FROM MEXICO ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO CEN- CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA THE SITUATION DOWN THERE IS WEIRD AND IT'S VERY SCREWED UP
INFLATION IS OUT OF THIS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENTS WHICH
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TECHNICALLY SUPPORTED FOR YEARS ARE CORRUPT AS ALL GET OUT
AND GENERALLY THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCREWED AND THEY'RE TIRED OF IT AND THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER IT EVEN IF THAT MEANS GOING TO COMMUNISM
UNFORTUNATELY YELTSIN'S GOT TOO MANY CONNECTIONS WITH THE OLD GUARD
THAT'S THE ONLY DRAWBACK THAT I SEE WITH THE ENTIRE THING GORBACHEV HAS MADE HIS ATTEMPT AND HE'S HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THE OLD GUARD HIMSELF
YELTSIN'S IN TIGHT WITH THE OLD GUARD
SO IT MAY BE TRYING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS AT THIS POINT
YOU MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY PULLED THE TROOPS OUT OF UH
OR THEY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IN EUROPE AFTER THE BERLIN WALL WENT DOWN I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT
BUT BY NO MEANS DO I
ENDORSE OR APPROVE PULLING EVERYBODY OUT
IT MAY BE
A MUCH REDUCED FORCE THAN WHAT WE USED TO HAVE OVER THERE
BUT YOU STILL BETTER HAVE THE KEY PLAYERS IN PLACE IF SOMETHING DOES GO DOWN EVEN IF IT'S A REGIONAL CONFLICT
IF
UNITED STATES IS GOING TO FLEX ITS MUSCLE AND BE THE SUPER POWER THAT IT IS
NOT ONLY DOES IT IT CAN TALK THE TALK BUT IT'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO WALK THE WALK IT'S GOT TO HAVE THE STUFF TO BACK IT BACK UP WHAT IT'S SAYING
IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT A TOKEN FORCE THERE YOU CAN'T HOLD YOUR GROUND
OKAY UM
I GUESS WHAT I GUESS MY
I USUALLY RIDE MY BIKE I HAVE UH A STATIONARY BIKE AND UH A REGULAR BIKE AND
WHEN I CAN I LIKE TO RIDE MY REGULAR BIKE OUTSIDE BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO MUCH NICER  THE STATIONARY BIKE IS IS SO UM
BORING  BUT I HAVE HEAD PHONES AND I PLUS I HAVE IT UH IN THE LIVING ROOM SO I EITHER WATCH TV OR
WE HAVE A FISH TANK SO I WATCH THE FISH YOU KNOW  WHATEVER I CAN DO TO KEEP MYSELF OCCUPIED
IF
THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY TIME I EVER WATCH TV IS WHEN I'M ON THE BIKE BUT
AND THEN USUALLY AFTER I'M DONE RIDING THE BIKE JUST TO COOL MYSELF DOWN I USUALLY TAKE A WALK YOU KNOW AND THAT JUST KIND OF GETS MYSELF UH GETS ME YOU KNOW
TO WHERE I'M NOT QUITE AS TIRED I GUESS BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A TASK I CAN'T SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOY IT  I WISH THAT I DID ENJOY IT MORE BUT I DO IT BECAUSE I HAVE TO NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO
YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
REALLY
SO IS IT JUST WOMEN THAT GO THERE
SEE I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH GOING TO A PLACE UH A A HEALTH CLUB BECAUSE
I DON'T FEEL LIKE HAVING A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE WATCH ME EXERCISE YOU KNOW SO I HAVE TRIED TO JUST DO STUFF AT HOME
AND UH I JUST FEEL CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT I MEAN I'M NOT BIG  YOU KNOW OR ANYTHING BUT I STILL DON'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE WATCHING ME YOU KNOW
YEAH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
THAT'S WHAT
REALLY THAT'S THAT'S GREAT HOW
DO THEY HAVE A POOL OR WHAT IS

LIKE WAT- ARE THEY WATER SHOES IS THAT
OH OKAY OKAY
OKAY
HUH THAT'S REALLY FUNNY
HUH
THAT'S
SO HOW OFTEN DO YOU FIND YOURSELF GOING UM ON A IF YOU'RE DOING IT ON A REGULAR BASIS HOW OFTEN DO YOU GO
YEAH THAT'S REALLY
REALLY
I WISH THAT I COULD MAKE MYSELF EXERCISE EVERY DAY BUT I DO FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT AT LEAST THREE TIMES A WEEK WHICH I DON'T FEEL LIKE IS ENOUGH BUT
UH IT'S IT'S AT LEAST SOMETHING  YOU KNOW IT IT I JUST FORCE I HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT LIKE I SAID BECAUSE TO ME I REALLY DON'T ENJOY IT BUT I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO DO IT I MEAN IT'S JUST
IT'S IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER I WANT TO YOU KNOW
BUT
UH-HUH
OH THAT'S
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
DID YOU EVER
WELL I'M SORRY
UH DID YOU EVER GO TO TEXINS AT ALL WHEN YOU WERE WORKING FOR TI
DID YOU EVER TRY THAT
OH OKAY

THEN THAT WOULD YEAH I GUESS THEN THE WATER AEROBICS WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BEST THING FOR YOU WOULDN'T IT
OH
WOW
UH-HUH
YEAH
OH
WOW
WHAT IF YOU'RE ALREADY ON ONE I MEAN YEAH I MEAN WHEN YOU GO IN THERE THEY WOULDN'T MAKE YOU DO THEIRS WOULD THEY

BUT THEY HAVE PACKAGES WHERE THEY JUST OFFER THE EXERCISE PROGRAM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
I SEE OKAY

UH-HUH
UH-HUH
SO YOU REALLY DO ENJOY YOUR EXERCISE THEN SINCE YOUR
UH-HUH
THAT'S YOU KNOW I WANTED
I WANTED TO GET ONE OF THOSE STEPPERS WHEN I BOUGHT THE BIKE BUT I GOT TALKED INTO THE BIKE INSTEAD AND
I DON'T KNOW
I REALLY WANTED A STEPPER I'M CONSIDERING MAYBE EVEN BUYING ONE OF THOSE TOO BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I'LL GET BENEFIT OUT OF BOTH OF THEM I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD REALLY DO ANY GOOD HAVING BOTH OF THEM
WHICH ONE DO YOU FEEL IS BETTER SINCE YOU USE THEM BOTH
UH-HUH
HUH
UH-HUH
OH REALLY
UM
UH-HUM
UH-HUH
BORING
YOU THINK SO
I BOUGHT A STATIONARY BIKE
BUT I FIND THAT IF I SIT  ON THAT SEAT TOO LONG IT HURTS
AND I HAVEN'T FIGURED HOW TO GET THAT SOFT AND I TRIED EVEN TYING A PILLOW TO IT
BUT TWO YEARS AGO I JOINED WELL IT'S NOT QUITE TWO YEARS IT'S ALMOST TWO YEARS I JOINED THE COSMOPOLITAN LADY HERE IN PLANO
AND I LOVE IT I JUST LOVE IT
YEAH IT'S TOTALLY WOMEN
I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SWEAT HAVE MY HAIR A MESS
UH
FEEL THAT OKAY FINE IF MY BATHING SUIT SLIPS A LITTLE BIT I DON'T HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF
OF IT BEING A LITTLE BIT TOO LOW AND I MY BATHING SUIT'S JUST ONE PIECE SO THERE'S NO BIG DEAL ALL THE WAY AROUND BUT I DON'T HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT I'M DOING OR HOW I'M DOING IT
AND IT'S UH OH IT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW IT'S A IT'S A TOTAL FREE RELAXATION BECAUSE HEY YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT YOU'RE A FEMALE AND
NO ONE IS STARING AT ANYBODY ELSE OR WORRYING ABOUT WHAT ANYTHING ELSE IS DOING
AND THEY'VE GOT SUCH FANTASTIC EQUIPMENT IN THERE
OH YEAH
AND I LOVE THE WATER AEROBICS I LOVE THE WATER AEROBICS
OH YEAH THEY'VE GOT A NICE ONE
THEY HAVE TWO TYPES OF WATER AEROBICS THEY CALL IT AQUA EXERCISE I GUESS IS WHAT THEY CALL IT
IT PUSHES YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE PUSHING AGAINST THE WATER IN ITSELF SO IT IS LIKE DOUBLE STRENUOUS BUT YOU'RE NOT
BEING DOUBLE STRENUOUS ON YOUR OWN BODY BECAUSE YOU'RE PUSHING IT YOURSELF
SO YOU'RE DOING IT YOURSELF BUT
HUH-UH THE ONLY THING THAT I EVER FELT WAS
EVERY TIME I STOP AND START GOING AGAIN BECAUSE I END UP GETTING TWO JOBS ONCE IN A WHILE I END UP HAVING TO QUIT FOR A WHILE BUT I GET BLISTERS ON MY TOES ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE I REALLY JUMP A LOT
BUT
WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE WEAR THOSE LITTLE UH TERRY CLOTH WITH RUBBER SOLES ON THE BOTTOM
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE POOL SO THEY JUST WEAR THEM RIGHT INTO THE POOL
YEAH THEY'RE JUST LITTLE TERRY CLOTH THINGS YOU WEAR FOR HOUSE SLIPPERS WITH RUBBER YOU KNOW SOLES SO THAT YOU KNOW NO BIG DEAL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
BUT I NEVER THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL AFTER YOU GO THERE FOR ABOUT A WEEK  YOUR TOES YOU START GETTING BLISTERS ANYWAY SO NO BIG DEAL
BUT IT'S FUN
I TRY TO MAKE IT AT LEAST THREE TIMES A WEEK
FOR A WHILE I WAS DOING IT EVERY DAY JUST
GOING UH FIVE DAYS A WEEK
WELL
WHEN I WAS WORKING UP AT UH THE SUMMIT HERE IN PLANO I'D LEAVE THERE
AND I'D BE AT THE SWIMMING POOL BY FOUR O'CLOCK
OH ACTUALLY ABOUT FOUR THIRTY BECAUSE THEY START AT FIVE TO SIX SO I WAS THERE BY FOUR THIRTY EVERY NIGHT
AND THE ONLY THING THAT EVER BOTHERED ME WAS MY HAIR GETTING WET
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT I DID OR HOW I DID IT I INVARIABLY GOT MYSELF WET
BUT THE WATER ONLY COMES UP BASICALLY TO YOUR
ANYWHERE FROM YOUR WAIST TO YOUR OH CHEST I'D SAY
SO I MEAN IT'S YOUR CHOICE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO BUT
I ENJOYED IT HIGHER
THAT'S OKAY
I HAVE A I HAVE A BAD BACK
SO I'M VERY LIMITED WHAT I DO
IT'S LIKE I CAN WALK
BUT IF I WALK FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES IT'S GOING TO BOTHER ME
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ON CEMENT OR ANYTHING THAT'S HARD IT WILL BOTHER ME IT WILL BOTHER ME
WELL THAT WHAT PUSHED ME THAT WAY THOUGH WAS BASICALLY WAS THE FACT THAT WHEN I WENT IN THERE IT WASN'T FOR THE WATER AEROBICS I WENT IN THERE STRICTLY TO STRENGTHEN MY BACK MUSCLES
AND UH SHE SAID HEY GO FOR THE SWIMMING POOL SHE SAYS YOU GET JUST AS MUCH IF YOU DID THE AEROBICS ON THE FLOOR SHE SAYS IN FACT YOU GET MORE
I SAID OKAY BECAUSE I'M NOT A SWIMMER
I LIKE WATER I'M NOT SCARED OF IT BUT I COULDN'T I GUESS I COULD SWIM ACROSS THE POOL BUT I'M NO SWIMMER PER SE
BUT I FOUND THAT THIS WORKED REALLY WELL AND I CAME OUT OF THERE AND I SAW MY STOMACH GOING DOWN WELL
I DROPPED OH I'D SAY ALMOST TWENTY POUNDS
JUST BY WATCHING WHAT I ATE AND THEY FIX YOU UP WITH A DIET WHICH WORKED REAL GOOD
WHAT A DIET
OH NO THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT
SEE I JOINED UH WHEN THIS
ONE DOWN HERE OPENED UP I JOINED AS A VIP AND THE VIP GIVES YOU UH
OH  GIVES YOU A DIET A COMPUTERIZED DIET AND THEY GO OVER ALL YOUR HEALTH AND ALL YOUR HISTORY AND THEY SHOW YOU HOW EVERYTHING TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS
SO IT BECAME PART OF THE PACKAGE SO I WENT THROUGH IT
IT WORKED OUT WELL
OH YEAH YOU CAN JUST GO IN THERE AND JOIN JUST LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE TOO
I JUST WENT TOOK THE BECAUSE THEY WERE OFFERING IT AS AN OPENING BENEFIT SO IT WAS
IT'S LESS THAN WHAT YOU PAY NOW FOR GOING IN THERE AFTER ALL THIS TIME
SO IT'S LIKE WHEN I GOT LAID OFF I WENT BACK IN THERE AND START ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'D DONE IT
SO I GET ALL THE SAME TREATMENT AGAIN SO IT'S KIND OF NICE
LIKE I SAID I LIKE IT I LIKE THE HEAT I LIKE THE
I JUMP OUT OF THE SWIMMING POOL AND I GO INTO THE HOT TUB
AND I LOVE IT
BECAUSE I HAVE N- I HAVE NEVER LET ME LET M- REWORD THAT I THINK I HAVE GONE HOME MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE SLIGHTLY SORE
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF MY PHYSICAL CONDITION AND NOTHING TO DO WHAT THEY DID
THAT'S I KNEW I WAS PUSHING TOO FAR
BUT USUALLY WHEN I GO INTO THE HOT TUB BEFORE I GO SWIMMING OR WHEN I COME OUT I'M TOTALLY RELAXED WHEN I GO HOME IT'S NO BIG DEAL
IT'S FUN IT'S FUN
UH I'VE GOTTEN ON THE BIKE AND THEY'VE GOT UH THE STEPPING BIKE WHERE YOU STEP
AND I'VE ENJOYED THAT WATCHING HOW WELL I CAN
WALK UP AND DOWN STAIRS
BUT MOST OF THE OTHERS TO ME ARE VERY DULL
UM
I GET BORED VERY EASILY
UH THE ONE NICE THING ABOUT THE BICYCLE
IS YOU JUST SIT LIKE YOU SAID YOU CAN SIT AND DO IT AND WATCH THE TV AND NOT EVEN REALLY BE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING
WITH THE STEPPER YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY WATCHING EACH STEP AS IT GETS HARDER AND DOWN
SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE YOU KNOW LITTLE YOU CAN PROGRAM THE ONE AT COSMOPOLITAN LADY SO
TO WHAT YOUR GEAR IS
UH I IT WOULD DEPEND UPON WHICH ONE YOU WANT I THINK NOW THAT I'VE HAD THE BICYCLE
I WOULD GO TO THE STEPPER
BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULD GO APPLY TO EITHER A HEALTH CLUB OR ONE OF THE OTHERS
AND USE IT FOR A WHILE BECAUSE YOU CAN BUY A MONTH'S MEMBERSHIP AND SEE WHAT YOU FEEL IS BEST FOR YOU
BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS YOU KNOW FOR EVERYONE THEIR OWN WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
BECAUSE I JUMP ON THE BIKE HERE AT HOME
MINE HAS ITS SEE THE HANDLE BARS GO UP AND DOWN SO I CAN SIT THERE AND READ AND LISTEN TO MUSIC LIKE WHAT YOU SAID AND IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ME
SO I MEAN IT'S
BORING
OKAY
YOU CAN GO FIRST OR I WILL
OKAY
WELL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I'D HAVE
DOWN IN THE SOUTH WE HAVE A LOT OF SHRIMP
OKAY AND I HAVE UH SHRIMP THAT IS STEAMED IN BEER THAT I COOK
AND THEN I HAVE A CAULIFLOWER THAT I WOULD COOK GARLIC BREAD GREEN SALAD TEA AND WE'D HAVE A LEMON PIE FOR DESSERT
YES AND WHAT'S REALLY NEAT ABOUT IT IS THE SHRIMP IS COOKED IN YOUR UH LIKE YOUR RICE STEAMER YOUR RICE COOKER
AND UM YOU PLACE THE SHRIMP IN THE
IN THE RICE STEAMER AND YOU PUT A BAY LEAF AND PUT SOME UH RED PEPPER OVER IT
NOW YOU CAN EITHER USE YOU KNOW THE KIND THAT COMES IN THE LITTLE CAN OR YOU CAN JUST GET SOME YOU KNOW REGULAR RED PEPPERS
CAYENNE UH-HUH
AND YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT OVER IT NOW IF YOU USE THE DRIED KIND
THEN YOU WOULD ONLY USE TWO OF THEM AND YOU PUT THAT IN THERE AND THEN YOU POUR TWO BOTTLES OF BEER OVER IT
TWO POUNDS
THAT'S THE JUMBO SHRIMP IN THE SHELLS LEAVE THE SHELLS ON THEM SO THEY WON'T JUST ROLL UP
AND YOU POUR THE BEER OVER THE TOP OF IT AND YOU COVER IT AND YOU ONLY COOK IT UNTIL THE MIXTURE BEGINS TO BOIL
AND THE SHRIMP TURN PINK THEN YOU REMOVE IT AND YOU PUT IT ON A PLATTER AND THEN YOU SERVE IT WITH MELTED BUTTER AND UH
I USUALLY PUT GARLIC POWDER IN MINE
AND THEY CAN JUST DIP IT AND THEY SHELL IT AS THEY EAT IT
BUT UH THEN THE MI- UH THE CAULIFLOWER YOU COOK THAT IN THE MICROWAVE AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST UH WASH IT AND YOU CORE IT
AND IN A LIKE A OH WHAT DO YOU CALL IT LIKE PYREX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT KIND OF BOWL THAT WOULD GO IN THE MICROWAVE
UH-HUH BUT IT'S GOT TO HAVE ONE THAT HAS A COVER ON IT
AND YOU UH PUT ABOUT TWO TABLESPOONS OF UH WATER INTO THIS BOWL AND ABOUT AN EIGHTH A TEASPOON OF SALT
AND THEN YOU JUST SET YOUR CAULIFLOWER IN THERE AND THEN YOU COOK IT FOR SEVEN MINUTES ON HIGH AND YOU ROTATE IT ONE TIME
UH-HUH Y- UH WHEN YOU CORE IT YOU BE REAL CAREFUL SO YOU WON'T KNOCK YOUR FLOWERS OFF
AND UH YOU JUST SET IT IN THERE AND YOU MICROWAVE IT ON HIGH FOR SEVEN MINUTES AND YOU TURN IT ONE TIME AND WHILE THAT'S COOKING I TAKE MAYONNAISE ABOUT A CUP OF MAYONNAISE
AND A TEASPOON OF MUSTARD AND SOME GARLIC POWDER AND I MIX IT ALL TOGETHER AND I SHRED UP SOME JUST REGULAR WHITE CHEESE
AND AFTER THAT'S COOKED YOU TAKE IT OUT AND POUR THIS ON TOP OF IT AND THEN YOU SPRINKLE THE CHEESE ON TOP OF THAT AND YOU COOK IT FOR ANOTHER THREE MINUTES ON HIGH
YOU KNOW JUST MAINLY TO MELT THE CHEESE AND EVERYTHING AND LET ALL THE SEASONING MELT INTO IT AND IT'S DONE
IT IS GOOD BUT IT IT LOOKS I MEAN WHAT YOU CAN DO THEN SEE IS LIKE WHAT I USUALLY DO IS I'LL LIKE SIT THE CAULIFLOWER IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN I PUT THE UH SHRIMP AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF IT YOU KNOW ON MY PLATTER
AND THEN I HAVE A GREEN SALAD THAT I PUT AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THAT
AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SEASONINGS AND STUFF AND THEN I JUST FIX LITTLE INDIVIDUAL CUPS FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE THE GARLIC BREAD AND IT MAKES IT A REAL NICE LOOKING
YOU KNOW
HUH-UH HUH-UH BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT YOU KNOW  YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WENT TO A WHOLE BUNCH
RIGHT AND UH USUALLY I CUT THOSE LITTLE CHERRY TOMATOES UP AND PUT SOME COLOR INTO IT YOU KNOW AND I'LL LAY THOSE ON TOP OF MY SALAD YOU KNOW TO MAKE IT LOOK NICE AND THINGS LIKE THAT
OKAY UH IT USUALLY SERVES SIX
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH

BECAUSE JUST LIKE NOW ESPECIALLY CRAWFISH IT IS STARTING TO MOVE OUT YOU KNOW AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO FIND OUT HOW GOOD IT IS
BUT
UH IT'S SIMILAR UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S NOT EXACTLY I MEAN IT'S GOT A TASTE OF ITS OWN YOU KNOW BUT IT IS IT IS SIMILAR TO BECAUSE YOU ONLY EAT THE TAILS OF IT
UM IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A CRAB
UH-HUH

YOU'RE PROBABLY LUCKY TO SEE THE END OF THE RUNWAY BY NOW
UM
WELL I'LL TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I I I COUNT THE STINK AS PART OF AIR POLLUTION AND IT STINKS DOWN HERE
IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE NOW IF YOU'RE OVER
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU'RE OVER BY ASHEVILLE YOU'RE YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE YOU'RE UP THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND YOU'VE GOT SOME NICE OZONE AND ALL THAT
OVER HERE IN RALEIGH IT'S KIND OF FLAT AND STAGNANT AND
JUST YUCKY
IT'S FINE OVER ON THE COAST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE YOU'VE GOT THE BREEZES OFF THE OFF THE WATER THERE
BUT UH SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST DULL AND UNINSPIRING HERE
NO I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE THEY KEEP DOING THINGS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE DOING ANY GOOD
I WAS I WAS REALLY AMAZED BECAUSE I NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED YOU KNOW THIS PROBLEM SOMEWHERE LIKE IN ATLANTA
AND I DROVE THROUGH ATLANTA UH COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS UNSEASONABLY WARM
AND YOU COULD SEE THE SMOG JUST SITTING ON TOP OF THE CITY
AND WHEN I DROVE THROUGH I WAS IT WAS TERRIBLE I HAD TO KEEP THE WINDOWS UP
IT WAS JUST SO THICK AND UH
HEAVY
UH I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I BECAUSE I ME- I USED TO LIVE IN ATLANTA YEARS AGO AND IT WAS ALWAYS FAIRLY CLEAN I MEAN YOU YOU ALWAYS YOU DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEM WITH STAGNANT AIR LIKE LIKE LA DOES
BUT BOY IT WAS REALLY BAD THAT DAY
AND IT
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT
BUT YOU SEE ALL THESE ALL THESE TRUCKS BELCHING OUT THIS BLACK SMOKE
YEAH I KNOW IT'S
I I I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PRIORITY IS IT'S UH LIKE IN ATLANTA THEY HAVE UM THEY HAVE MANDATORY CATALYTIC CONVERTER INSPECTIONS
THERE'S ONLY THREE PLACES IN GEORGIA THAT REQUIRES THAT
AND UH EVEN WITH THAT IT HASN'T DONE ANY GOOD
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOTTEN A LOT WORSE
BUT YOU KNOW JUST LIKE YOU SAY YOU GO THROUGH THERE AND YOU WATCH ALL THESE TRUCKS AND THEY'RE JUST COUGHING OUT ALL KINDS OF STUFF SOME OF THEM SPITTING IT OUT SO THICK YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE PAST IT
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW
UH-HUH YEAH BECAUSE OF THE STUFF SETTLES ON IT
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WELL LIKE ACID RAIN AND ALL THESE SULPHUR DIOXIDES BEING DUMPED OUT THERE
I I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THAT THAN I AM JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
BECAUSE UH
UH IT'S IT'S ALL I MEAN IT'S JUST LI- IT'S JUST LIKE A BIG AVALANCHE YOU KNOW YOU START PUTTING SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND YOU END UP WITH ACID RAIN ACID RAIN KILLS TREES
THE TREES DON'T SCRUB THE AIR AND THERE YOU ARE
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE FOLKS CUTTING DOWN ON THE RAIN FOREST AS QUICK AS THEY CAN
I WONDER TOO YOU KNOW THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT OZONE DEPLETION AND ALL THIS
IT IT SEEMS FUNNY THAT IT'S COMING AROUND AT THE TIME WHEN WE'RE LOSING THE MOST MOST OF THE FORESTS
BECAUSE I I I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE POLLUTANTS AND STUFF ARE BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE AIR
UH
YOU KNOW BY THE PLANTS AND THE TREES AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF AND HERE WE ARE LOSING IT AND NOW THE NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WHERE TO GO
BUT OZO-
UH-HUH YEAH WELL IT'S LIKE OUR WINTER HERE I MEAN IT WAS THE WINTER THAT WASN'T YOU KNOW WE WERE HAVING HAVING HOT DAYS IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY
AND GOT IN
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH YOU MI- YOU MIGHT AS WELL SELL IT FOR SCRAP OR SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY NEVER WILL USE IT
IT'S A SHAME TOO BECAUSE I MISS ALL THE COLD WEATHER I I ENJOY WINTER
YEAH
YEAH WE- IT WAS AN INTERESTING DAY THE OTHER DAY UH I THINK IT WAS UM YEAH IT WAS LAST NOT NOT THIS PAST FRIDAY BUT FRIDAY A WEEK AGO
WE HA- I DON'T KNOW I THINK YOU HAD SOME BAD WEATHER UP THERE TOO WE HAD TORNADOES AND EVERYTHING DOWN HERE
UM THAT WAS THE MOST HISTORIC WEATHER DAY IN RECORDED HISTORY FOR SEVERE WEATHER IN THE COUNTRY
ON THAT ONE DAY I MEAN YOU KNOW OF COURSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE SEVERE WEATHER SOMEWHERE
BUT THERE WAS MORE OF IT ON THAT ONE DAY THAN EVER RECORDED BEFORE OVER FOUR HUNDRED REPORTS OF TORNADOES HAIL AND HEAVY WINDS
AMAZING
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARY
YEAH
UM
I READ AN ARTICLE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH UH TALKING AGAIN ABOUT THE OZONE LAYER THEY SAID THAT THE UH
THE OZONE DETERIORATION IS GREATER THAN THEY HAD ORIGINALLY THOUGHT OVER SOME OF THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARY TO THINK ABOUT
BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO IMPROVE THINGS AROUND THERE
YEAH
WELL THAT'S THAT'S YEAH THAT HAD THAT HAD BEEN THE THING THAT HAD ALWAYS I MEAN I I I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THE OZONE LAYER AS SORT OF LIKE A LAYER AND IT WOULD MOVE AROUND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE HOLE JUST STAYED THERE
YOU KNOW I GUESS I I DON- I'M NOT THAT MUCH OF A METEOROLOGIST
BUT UH YEAH I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THAT TOO BECAUSE UP TO THAT POINT ALL I'D HEARD ABOUT WAS THE ONE OVER THE POLE
AND I SAID WELL I'M NOT TOO AWFULLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IF IT'S GOING TO START MELTING THE ICE CAP IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FOR A LONG TIME YET
BUT OPENING OPENING UP OVER MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS NOW THAT'S  THAT'S
YEAH YEAH
YEAH COURSE THE OZONE IS UP THERE SO
YEAH I M- I MEAN DI- I DON'T EVEN KNOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE OZONE LAYER DOES MOVE I MEAN APPARENTLY IT DOESN'T BUT
OF COURSE IT IT MIGHT BE JUST A COUPLE OF SCIENTISTS TRYING TO GET THEIR NAME IN THE PAPER SORT OF LIKE COLD FUSION
YEAH I'LL TELL YOU I I WAS REAL EXCITED WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT I SAID HOT DOG THEY FINALLY DID IT YOU KNOW
UM I T-
I MEAN I'M
YEAH I MEAN I'M AN OLD SCIENCE FICTION BUFF FROM WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT SCIENCE FICTION WAS MADE OUT OF
AND IT'S THE DAYS THAT I KEEP LOOKING FOR THAT AREN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IN MY LIFETIME
BUT
YOU KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MOON COLONIES BY NOW
BUT UH YEAH COLD FUSION WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT
COULD HAVE GONE MIGHT HAVE STARTED MAKING A LITTLE INROADS ON AIR POLLUTION WITH THAT
BUT WHO KNOWS
YEAH
YEAH THERE'S ALWAY- THERE'S ALWAYS A DRAWBACK TO EVERYTHING I MEAN
I DON'T KNOW
WELL
OKAY
WELL
UH I'VE NOTICED SOME CHANGES OVER THE PAST UH THIRTY YEARS
THAT UH
THAT IT'S GOTTEN WORSE
I CAN REMEMBER UH BACK IN THE EARLY SIXTIES WHEN I FIRST STARTED FLYING A LIGHT PLANE
IT WAS QUITE COMMON FOR ME TO TAKE OFF FROM UH LOCAL AIRPORT HERE AND SEE THE UH APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS AND THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AT THE SAME TIME
AND IN THE YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS LATER IT WAS A RARE OCCASION THAT I COULD SEE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME
YEAH I KNOW UH LOT OF TIMES WHEN I WAS COMING BACK HOME I WOULD UH FILE INSTRUMENT FLIGHT PLAN JUST TO GET INTO THE WASHINGTON AREA
BUT I COUNTED ON NORTH CAROLINA HAVING SOME GOOD WEATHER FOR ME
WELL DOWN THERE YOU GET UH UH SOME MORE AROMATIC AROMAS LIKE THE UH THE SMELL OF THE PINE FOREST AND UH
THEN YOU GET DOWN WIND OF A PAPER MILL ONCE IN A WHILE
UM
YEAH
WELL I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO UH SOLVE MUCH OF THE PROBLEM
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WELL ONE OF THE REACTIONS I HAVE IS THAT UH THEY PUT SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE PRIVATE AUTOMOBILE
UH AS BEING A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION AND THEY'VE UH IGNORED THE TRUCKS ENTIRELY
SO I I GET TO GOING DOWN THE EXPRESSWAY IN THE MORNING AND UH I DON'T SEE VERY MANY CARS SMOKING
BUT
THEN I I GET SURROUNDED BY TWENTY OR FORTY TRUCKS AND THEY'RE JUST LAYING OUT A PALL OF BLACK SMOKE
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW ALONG ROUTE SIXTY SIX THE UH PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESIDENCES THERE
UH THEY CAN'T PAINT THEIR HOUSES WITHOUT CLEANING THEM FIRST
UH
IF THEY'RE WITHIN A BLOCK OF A MAJOR EXPRESSWAY THE HOUSES GET COATED WITH OIL
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THAT ALREADY
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL WE'VE SORT OF BEEN SEEING A LITTLE CLIMATIC SHIFT HERE ON THE EAST COAST OR AT LEAST IT SEEMS THAT WAY THAT UH THE WINTERS HAVE BEEN MILDER FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND UH
YEAH
YEAH THE FIRST THE FIRST WINTER I MOVED OUT HERE I HAD A BIG SNOW PLOW ON THE TRACTOR AND I HAD TO USE IT WE HAD THREE UH FOURTEEN INCH UH SNOWS
AND I HAVEN'T USED IT SINCE
AND AT THE SAME TIME I I SEE SOME COLDER WINTERS IN THE MIDWEST I THINK THEY'VE GOTTEN MORE SNOW IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAN WE'RE HAVING HERE ON THE EAST COAST
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
HUH
WELL IT MAY HAVE BEEN UH THE FACT WE HAD THIS EARLY SEASON WARM SPELL
THAT DID THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE THE PRE- THE PRECEDING DAY THURSDAY I GOT MY FIRST SUNBURN FOR THE SEASON OUT ON UH OCEAN CITY BEACH
YES
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT UH KNOW THAT THEY'D DISCOVERED ANY THINNESS OR OVER ME- METRO AREAS I'D ONLY HEARD ABOUT THE UH NORTH AND SOUTH POLE
YEAH
YEAH THAT THAT DOESN'T UH FIT MY PICTURE OF UH OF UH METEOROLOGY I CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLES BECAUSE THEY'RE UH A PERMANENT HIGH PRESSURE AREA
AND UH YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH UH CIRCULATION
BUT UH THE TEMPERATE ZONE IS UH A CONSTANT MOVING UH WIND SYSTEM
AND IT'S I'M SURPRISED THAT THE OZONE DOESN'T HAVE IT'S OWN WIND PATTERN
YEAH
COLD FUSION RIGHT
THE SAME THOUGHT FLASHED IN MY MIND
YEAH I UH
I MAY HAVE PUT OUT AN EXCLAMATION HERE AT HOME WHEN I HEARD THAT NEWS
AND UH EVERYBODY WANTED TO KNOW WHY I WAS SO EXCITED AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
I THINK SO
EXCEPT WE MIGHT HAVE UH BAD CASE OF PALADIUM POISONING NOW
I KNOW THERE WAS UH A PIPELINE GOING IN UP IN UH
SOUTHERN PENNSYLVANIA
AND THERE WAS A GROUP
IN UH BUCKS COUNTY THAT WAS FIGHTING IT
AND UH ONE OF THE WOMEN THAT WAS LEADING THE GROUP SAID WELL THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO PUMP UH OIL THROUGH THERE BUT BEFORE LONG THEY'LL BE PUMPING RADIOACTIVITY THROUGH IT
MOST OF IT IS TV
YES I DO WE GET A DAILY AND THEN I GET UH THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ALSO
IT'S THE UH CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
UM-HUM
YES RIGHT
AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL GIVES FINANCIAL NEWS AND OTHER INFORMATION I'M INTERESTED IN
YES BUT IT'S USUALLY AFTER THE FACT UH AS FAR AS THE MAJOR TOPICS BECAUSE MOST OF THE OTHER HAS BEEN ON TV DON'T YOU AGREE
YEAH
OH I THINK UH DURING THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF TOO QUICK TO TRY TO GET A SCOOP AND NOT CHECKING FACTS OUT AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A A GOOD RELEVANT
UH FEAR OF ALL OF IT YEAH I DIDN'T SEE A MOVIE A LONG TIME AGO BUT IT WAS ABOUT THE NEWS TEAM THAT UM
TRIED TO INFLUENCE THE WORLD AND I I HAVE A FEELING THAT THEY'RE MUCH MORE INTO THEMSELVES SOMETIMES THAN THEY ARE INTO WHAT THE WORLD UM IS READY TO HEAR THEY CREATE NEWS
YEAH YEAH I THINK SO TOO
AND RADIO IS SORT OF A CATCH UP IN FACT I WAS UM LISTENING TO THE RADIO THE OTHER DAY AND THAT THEY WERE REPORTING ON THE CONDITION OF AN OF AN ACCIDENT VICTIM
AND I HAD ALREADY SEEN ON THE NEWS ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THAT THAT ACCIDENT VICTIM HAD DIED BUT THE RADIO NEWS REPORT WAS THAT HE WAS STILL IN INTENSIVE CARE SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE UM
IT THE MOST IMMEDIATE IS TV THE OTHERS ARE CATCH UP AND FILL IN
UH-HUH
HOW DO YOU FEEL THE THE NEWSPAPERS THERE IN COLORADO SPRINGS UH TREATS LOCAL INTEREST NEWS
UH-HUH
UH-HUH

A TRANSAM UH IN FACT THERE WAS A RING I KNOW THAT YOU STOP RIGHT UP HERE AND UH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD CALL TI SECURITY WHEN THEY KNEW THEY WERE IN TOWN BASICALLY AND SAY
YOU KNOW TELL ALL YOUR FOLKS WITH VETS AND WHATEVER ELSE TO BE LOO- ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM BUT THAT'S EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW
YEAH THEY DON'T WANT TO WRITE YOU
UH
OH THAT'S NOT GOOD
WELL OKAY
NOW I UH I MEAN I'VE HAD OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY TOUCHED UM I HAVE HAD A COUSIN OF MINE THAT WAS MURDERED
UH THINGS LIKE THAT UH FOR NO APPARENT REASON YOU KNOW IT'S THAT WAS LOST IN THE COUNTRY TRYING TO FIND HER FOLKS NEW HOUSE UP IN KANSAS AND
STOPPED TO USE THE PHONE AND A TEENAGE KID WHOSE PARENTS HAD LOTS OF MONEY
UH KILLED HER SO NOTHING WAS EVER DONE TO HIM
BUT SO YOU KNOW YEAH I I'M NOT SURE THERE'S MANY LIVES THAT AREN'T AFFECTED BY IT SOMEWHERE
UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS SHOULD BE PER SE
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
I UM I WOULD LIKE A HOME ALARMS THAT PERIMETER ALARM SYSTEM I'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE ONE THAT THE AMWAY CORPORATION UH
PUTS TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S AS EXTENSIVE AS YOU WANT IT TO BE YOU CAN
YOU CAN KIND OF COORDINATE TO YOUR OWN HOME YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY UH TYPES OF DEVICES YOU NEED AND IT'S A WIRELESS SYSTEM SO IT'S NOT ONE THEY CAN DISABLE
THE NAME  AMGUARD
YEAH THEY MAKE IT UH-HUH AND
OH
OH
YEAH ABOUT MY HUSBAND HE'S LIKE ONE OF THESE LIKE I WANT TO HAVE GUNS AND GUNS KIND OF SCARE ME
UH NOT SO MUCH FOR ME YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE I'M RESPONSIBLE I'D LEARN HOW TO USE IT AND YES I COULD SHOOT SOMEONE IF YOU KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO TAKE MY KIDS OR TAKE MY LIFE OR
YOU KNOW I'M BASICALLY A NONVIOLENT PERSON BUT I COULD DO THAT
BUT IT SCARES ME BECAUSE OF SO MANY ACCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITH CHILDREN IN THE HOME THAT FIND THE GUNS AND
UH YOU KNOW ACCIDENTALLY SHOOT A BROTHER OR SHOOT A SISTER OR SHOOT THEMSELVES AND I'M NOT REAL SOLD ON THAT YET
BY THEIR OWN
YEAH
WELL ARE YOU FOR UH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
WELL THAT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE I AM TOO MY MY SADNESS WITH IT OCCURS THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONSISTENT
YOU KNOW I I HAVE A HARD TIME PUTTING ONE PERSON'S DEATH FOR THE SAME CRIME THAT YOU SEND THE OTHER PERSON TO JAIL FOR
YOU KNOW IT DOES TO ME NEED TO BE CONSISTENT BUT
UH I I
FOR LIFE
THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE
OF COURSE MY HUSBAND'S OF THE MIND THAT YOU OUGHT TO TAKE THEM ALL OUT IN THE BACK ALLEY AND SHOOT THEM
I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPASSION I DO THINK THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT
ONLY BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN ONES SENT AWAY THAT DIDN'T DO IT BUT I KNOW THAT'S FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
I UH I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER YOU KNOW I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THE ANSWER TO THE DOPE PROBLEM THAT YOU KNOW GENERATES SO MUCH OF THE CRIME IS
YOU KNOW IT WAS ALWAYS YOU KNOW SHOOT THE DEALERS AND SOMEBODY MADE THE YOU KNOW TAKE AWAY THE SUPPLY BUT SOMEBODY MADE A COMMENT TO ME A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THAT'S KIND OF HAD ME THINKING HE SAID
HE SAID SOMEBODY ELSE WILL COME UP WITH THE SUPPLY HE SAID WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU KNOW SHOOT OR MAKE IT HARD ON THE USERS BECAUSE IF THE DEMAND IS GONE THEY WON'T HAVE ANYBODY TO SUPPLY TO
WELL THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE
SURE
SURE
THAT'S TRUE
BUT WHERE WAS IT UH OH SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND I WANT TO SAY LIKE MALAYSIA
SOMETHING WITH AN M MADAGASCAR OR SOMEWHERE A SMALL COUNTRY
UH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A CRIME PUNISHABLE B- BY DEATH TO THEM TO BE CARRYING ANYTHING AND I THINK SOME BRITISH CITIZENS HAD GONE IN LIKE UH A LADY AND HER SON AND THEY HAD SOME MARIJUANA ON THEM AND THEY HUNG THEM
WAS THAT MALAYSIA
OKAY I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I THOUGHT JEEZ THAT SEEMED SO SEVERE FOR MARIJUANA BUT THEN I THOUGHT OR IS THAT JUST BECAUSE UM
I HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO OTHER THINGS IN HEARING OTHER THINGS YOU KNOW IF I KNEW TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS GOT HUNG FOR CARRYING A LITTLE BIT OF MARIJUANA IT MIGHT MAKE ME THINK TWICE BEFORE I EVER DID IT IF I WAS OF THE MIND TO YOU KNOW
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE BUT I
I DO FEEL LIKE
I DO FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY'RE BLATANT CRIMINALS AND THEY'VE GOT RECORDS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THE SYSTEM PROTECTS THEM MORE THAN IT HELPS THE OTHERS
NO WE'RE NOT
DEATH
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I REMEMBER GROWING UP AND UH
YOU KNOW WE'D LEAVE THE HOUSE OPEN IF WE WERE IN THE HOUSE YEAH IF WE WENT SOMEWHERE I GREW UP IN A LARGE I GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO
YOU KNOW IF WE WENT SOMEWHERE SURE WE'D LOCK THE DOORS IF IT WAS JUST DOWN THE STREET WE WOULDN'T OR IF WE WERE IN THE HOUSE WE WOULDN'T
BUT NOW YOU KNOW I COME HOME I LOCK THE DOOR IF WE OPEN THE DOOR I LOCK THE SCREEN DOOR YOU KNOW I WANT IT LOCKED WHEN I'M IN IT EVERY TIME I GO SOMEWHERE AND I I JUST ALMOST HATE THAT FEELING
YEAH
WELL THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT ISN'T IT WHERE'D YOU GROW UP
OH OKAY
UM EXCUSE ME
YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MINOR WHEN I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE GIVE THEIR LIVES  SO
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS THOUGH I I I DO WISH WE HAD A SYSTEM THAT WAS A BIT MORE FAIR
OH WELL THAT'S GOOD
RIGHT I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE
I DO KNOW THAT OUR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET OUR DEVELOPMENT IS PROBABLY ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLD
MAYBE NOT THAT LONG WE'VE LIVED HERE SIX YEARS PROBABLY SEVEN YEARS OLD
AND UH
THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET YOU KNOW SHE WALKED IN ONE NIGHT ON SOMEBODY AND OF COURSE HE LEFT SHE WAS FORTUNATE
BUT THINGS LIKE THAT MAKE IT REAL TO ME AND AWARE THAT IT REALLY IS GOING ON
YOU KNOW THAT'S IT NOT A FAIRY TALE WORLD HERE
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
WELL

PEOPLE RECOGNIZED DALLAS TEXAS BY THE THE TEXAS UH THE THE COWBOYS AND BY THAT PROGRAM
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE TWO THINGS THEY ASSOCIATE WITH DALLAS TEXAS SO I AND I THEY ASKED ME S- SEVERAL TIMES THEY ASK ME WHY ARE THERE TWO BRIDGES
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VIADUCTS
IS THAT THAT IS RIGHT ISN'T IT
BECAUSE THEY ASK ME WHY ARE THERE TWO BRIDGES GOING INTO DALLAS
DARNED IF I KNOW  I WAS BLANK LOOKING YOU KNOW I FELT REALLY DUMB
WELL THERE'S WATER IN THE TRINITY I THOUGHT IT WAS TO GOING TO OAK CLIFF OVER THE TRINITY
OH DO THEY

UH-HUH
I THINK THAT IS JUST A HOOT THAT'S ONE OF THOSE FEW THAT I DO WATCH AND THE TELEVISION IS ON MY HUSBAND LIKES TO WATCH TV IT'S ON
I USUALLY READ AND WATCH TV
AND USUALLY I CAN HANDLE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW BECAUSE I AM PRETTY SURE WHERE THE TV PLOT'S GOING
BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THAT I JUST ACTUALLY WATCH BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY
I REALLY ENJOY THAT ONE
NOW WE WATCH A LOT OF THOSE UH AND THE ONES THAT SOMETIMES WILL HOOK ME
TO PUT DOWN MY BOOK WILL BE THE ONE THERE WAS ONE UH RECENTLY ABOUT THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
AND THEY WRAPPED A FICTIONAL STORY AROUND IT
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS WELL DONE
AND AND IT IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION I WOUND UP WATCHING THE WHOLE THING
UM
I GUESS THE AWARDS CEREMONIES AND THERE SEEMS TO BE DOZENS OF THEM PER YEAR
MAYBE I'VE SPENT TWO MINUTES WATCHING TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE ON AND IF THEY MAKE A FOOL OF THEMSELVES OR NOT
BUT UH THEY COULD TAKE THAT WHOLE COLLECTION AND IT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND I'D NEVER MISS IT FOR A MINUTE
PARTICULARLY THE BEAUTY PAGEANTS I I PARTICULARLY TAKE ISSUE WITH THOSE I I REALLY DISLIKE THOSE
YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND USED TO JUST BE RIVETED TO THE DALLAS COWBOYS AND NOW
WE'RE OUT RUNNING AROUND AND IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE PLAYING HE'LL TURN IT ON WHILE WE'RE IN THE CAR TO SEE WHAT THE SCORE IS AND HE'LL LISTEN
BUT EVEN I'VE SAID HEY LOOK YOU'RE FASCINATED WITH THIS YOU SIT AND LISTEN TO THE COWBOYS LET ME RUN IN HERE AND I'LL DO SOME THINGS AND I'LL COME BACK AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MISS HE'LL SAY NAH NAH NAH
AND HE DOESN'T HE DOESN'T WATCH IT HE LI- LIKE I SAY IF IT'S CONVENIENT HE'LL LISTEN TO IT
BUT HE JUST DOESN'T WATCH THEM ON TV LIKE HE USED TO
OH

THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN BUT
I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN AS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LOVE TO WATCH AND THIS IS NOT THIS IS RARELY ON TELEVISION BUT WHAT IS A LOT OF FUN TO GO ATTEND IS THIS ARENA FOOTBALL
YEAH I LIKE IT'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN STRAIGHT FOOTBALL
IT IT DOESN'T IT HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT RULES THE FIELD IS HALF THE SIZE
AND THERE'S NO
THEY CAN'T CALL TIME AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT MOVES A LOT FASTER
UH AGAIN I THINK IT MAY BE ON CABLE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE DON'T HAVE CABLE
WELL
OH
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE THEY'RE ON EVERY CORNER EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO SEE
WELL AND I LIKE TO RENT TAPES BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT THE THING ON HOLD IF YOU GET A TELEPHONE CALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OR IT BECOMES SNACK TIME FOR VARIOUS REASONS YOU CAN PUT YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING THIS DANCE WITH WOLVES I WANT TO SEE IT IN A THEATER
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT YOUR YOU'LL LOSE FIFTY PERCENT OF IT IF YOU DON'T
THAT'S WHAT I HEAR TOO
WELL MY HUSBAND SMOKES HE'S ONE OF THE DINOSAURS THAT STILL SMOKES AND YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN MOVIE THEATERS
AND THAT HAS REALLY SLOWED DOWN THE FORWARD PROGRESS OF GOING TO MOVIES
BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY CARED UP UNTIL THIS POINT BUT I WE ARE THIS WEEKEND GOING TO GO SEE DANCE WITH WOLVES IT'S THAT'S IT WE WILL DO IT
SO YEAH FINALLY
WELL I TEND MY JOB TENDS TO BE VERY DEMANDING

UH IT'S KIND OF HARD TO PUT MY FINGER ON A ON A FAVORITE TV PROGRAM HOWEVER UH ONE THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IS DALLAS AND UH
AND UH IT'S GOING TO BE GOING OFF THE AIR UH LET'S SEE A WEEK FROM FRI- A WEEK FROM TONIGHT

AND THAT'S WHY
UH IT KIND OF CONFUSES PEOPLE BUT UH UH
I ENJOY A A A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMEDIES UM
I THINK IT'S MAINLY FOR AN ESCAPE
UM YOU KNOW YOU UH MY JOB IS NOT THE MOST THRILLING IN THE WORLD AND UH I ENJOY LAUGHING AND UH SOME OF THE SHOWS THAT
UH ARE ON THE AIR SOME ARE JUST PURELY YOU KNOW BRAIN DRAINERS
AND THEN THERE'S OTHER ONES THAT UH DEAL WITH UH IN A FUNNY MANNER UH SOCIALLY RELEVANT THINGS AND UH ONE SHOW THAT COMES TO MIND IS LIKE DESIGNING WOMEN
UM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM

YES IT UH IT HAS BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING AND AND ALSO UH THE THE ISSUES THEY DEAL WITH UH REALLY TENDS TO OPEN
OPEN YOUR EYES AS WELL AS YOUR MIND TO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND UH I'VE I'VE REALLY ENJOYED THAT ONE SINCE IT CAME ON
UM DON'T LIKE THE POLITICS SURROUNDING THE PROGRAM THOUGH BUT I MEAN OTHER THAN THAT YOU KNOW THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE F- IN FIGHTING GOING ON BETWEEN THE PRODUCERS AND ONE OF THE ACTRESSES BUT UH
AND THEN UH I'VE KIND OF GOTTEN HOOKED ON PBS STUFF UH PUBLIC UH TV
UH I LIKE THINGS LIKE NOVA AND UH SOME OF THE THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS THEY COME UP WITH ON NATURE AND STUFF I JUST ENJOY WATCHING THAT STUFF

I COULDN'T RATIONALIZE PAYING YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE IF I PAY FOR A MOVIE CHANNEL THEN I HAVE TO WATCH WHAT MOVIES THEY WANT ME TO WATCH WHEN THEY WANT ME TO WATCH THEM
AND IF I
YOU KNOW IF I DIDN'T USE CABLE FOR ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE BASIC WELL I CAN GET THAT FOR FREE
AND WELL I D- REALLY DON'T NEED CNN I SEE ENOUGH BAD NEWS ALL THE TIME I DON'T NEED TO SEE MORE OF IT SO I I'VE KIND OF UH
RATIONALIZED THAT IT'S IT'S PROBABLY A LOT MORE ECONOMICAL FOR US TO JUST GO RENT THE MOVIES WE WANT TO SEE
AND OF COURSE WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN TEXAS IT WAS REAL CONVENIENT WITH TOM THUMB YOU KNOW HAVING MOVIES UH BACK THEN IT WAS NINETY NINE CENTS I MEAN GO
YEAH
AND YOU CAN SEE THEM A LOT SOONER THAN YOU CAN SEE THEM ON ANY OF THE STATIONS LIKE HBO OR CINEMAX

SHE DOESN'T LIKE GOING TO MOVIE THEATERS BECAUSE USUALLY THEY'RE DIRTY

AND UH SO I'M I'M HOPING I CAN GET HER TALKED INTO IT SOON
HM
UM THAT'S GREAT
YEAH BUT AS AS FAR AS UH REGULAR TV SHOWS I MEAN I'VE GOT SOME
SOME SHOWS THAT I THAT THAT I WOULD BE AFRAID TO ADMIT TO YOU THAT I'VE ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AND WATCHED
AND THEN THERE'S THERE'S OTHERS THAT UH UH I I WISH I HAD TIME TO SEE IT'S LIKE I ENJOY WATCHING CHEERS IT'S VERY FUNNY SOME OF THE THINGS IN IT ARE MINDLESS BUT I I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO WATCH IT
UM I THINK ABOUT THE ONLY NIGHT THAT I REALLY SIT IN FRONT OF THE TV SET ALL NIGHT LONG PROBABLY IS ON MONDAY NIGHTS AND BECAUSE
UM I WORK SO HARD OVER THE WEEKEND DOING OTHER THINGS WITH THE KIDS AND STUFF AND GOING TO WORK ON MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT I'M JUST WORN OUT
SO I KIND OF USE IT AS THE TIME TO CATCH UP ON CORRESPONDENCE AND AND LOOK OVER THINGS AND I CAN SIT IN FRONT OF THE TV SET AND LOOK AT YOU KNOW
DO GO THROUGH MY MAIL AND AND WATCH TV AT THE SAME TIME
UM-HUM
OKAY UM WHAT AREA DO YOU ARE YOU IN WHAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY
OH IN HOUSTON OKAY I'M UP IN PLANO NEAR DALLAS
DO YOU LIVE IN A SUBURB OR
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
UH-HUH
IS IT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT FIXING IT UP OR KEEPING IT UP YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEP
YEP
OH YEAH YEAH
OH BOY
YEAH
SO YOU DON'T WANT
WELL WE HAVE A REALLY LARGE HOUSE WE HAVE THREE KIDS AND WE BOUGHT A FIVE BEDROOM HOUSE WHEN WE MOVED HERE AND UM IT'S GETTING TO BE TOO MUCH  TOO MUCH WORK TO KEEP IT UP
THREE THREE SO WE HAVE A BEDROOM FOR EVERYBODY AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXTRA PLAYROOM FOR THEM TO PILE ALL THEIR TOYS IN AND AN EXTRA TV UP THERE AND THE IRONING BOARD
WELL YEAH I THAT'S THE OTHER THING IS I WAS WORKING UH FULL TIME I JUST STARTED BACK ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
AND UM MY YOUNGEST ONE GOT TO BE THREE YEARS OLD AND SO THEN I WENT BACK TO WORK AND I DECIDED AFTER A YEAR OF BEING A SECRETARY THAT WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WAS GO BACK AND GET MY MASTER'S DEGREE
AND UM SO THEN I WENT TO PART-TIME WORK AND I'M GOING TO SCHOOL PART-TIME
AND UH IT'S GETTING TO BE TOO MUCH FINANCIALLY TOO WITHOUT MY FULL TIME INCOME SO WE'RE WE'RE JUST DECIDED TO PUT LAST WEEK TO PUT OUR HOUSE ON THE MARKET AND UM GET A SMALLER HOUSE NOT TOO SMALL THOUGH WITH THREE KIDS
SO SO THAT THAT WAS KIND OF A HARD DECISION TO MAKE BUT I THINK UH I IT'S JUST BEEN AN AWFUL LOT YOU KNOW FINANCIAL IS ONE THING AND THAT'S KIND OF CONCRETE BUT ALSO IT'S JUST
THERE IT THE HOUSE IS JUST REALLY BIG AND THERE THERE'S A LOT OF KIDS AND A LOT OF SPACE AND IT ALL GETS MESSED UP
SO AND WITH CLEANING OUT TO YOU KNOW TO SELL THE HOUSE WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAN THINGS OUT IN CLOSETS AND THE PLAYROOM AND THE GARAGE AND EVERYTHING
AND WHEN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH SPACE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AS CAREFUL ABOUT THROWING STUFF OUT YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE GARAGE OR PUT IT IN THE PLAYROOM OR SOMETHING
SO IT'S JU- WE JUST HAVE MASSIVE STUFF THAT YOU KNOW IS WE JUST ACCUMULATED TOO MUCH STUFF I MEAN NOT THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS IT'S JUST LITTLE JUNKY YOU KNOW OLD TOYS
THAT'S IT
YEAH
RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM
THERE'S NO PLACE TO PUT IT YEAH

YOU HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED E- ENOUGH TO KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE TO BE ABLE TO FIND THINGS IF IT GETS TOO MESSY YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE GOING THROUGH TRYING TO FIND WHAT YOU NEED
SO I LEARNED THAT IT HAS YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN STANDARD OF CLEANLINESS BUT I MEAN ORGANIZATION BUT
I- I MEAN COMPARED TO THE OTHER MOTHERS HERE ON MY STREET THAT DON'T WORK I MEAN MY HOUSE IS JUST IT LOOKS HORRIBLE COMPARED TO THEIRS
BUT I MEAN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOU KNOW IF YOU GOING TO
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YEAH SO THAT'S WHAT SLIDES FOR ME
RIGHT EXACTLY
YEAH AND WE THIS HOUSE WAS NEW WHEN WE BOUGHT IT AND IT'S ALL WHITE WALLS AND SO WE PUT UP SOME WALLPAPER AND SOME DRAPES AND YOU KNOW BUT WE JUST NEVER GOT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO REALLY DECORATE IT

YOU SEE WE DID THIS ONE HUGE WALL THAT WE HAVE AND IT WAS LIKE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF WALLPAPER AND I DIDN'T EVEN BUY THAT EXPENSIVE KIND YOU KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T EVEN COST THAT MUCH BUT IT WAS IT'S A REAL LONG WALL
SO IF WE HAD A SMALLER HOUSE  EVERYTHING WOULD BE SMALLER AND IT IT WOULDN'T TAKE W- IT TOOK US TWO WEEKENDS TO PUT ALL THE WALLPAPER UP YOU KNOW
AND UH
BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
UH
WE HAVE WE HAVE DRIVEN AROUND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN TO HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS WE WANT TO TRY AND STAY IN THE SAME SCHOOL AREA SO WE'VE DRIVEN AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE'VE LOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT UM
I STILL TRYING TO FIND TIME TO GET THIS HOUSE THIS WEEKEND WE'RE GOING TO FINISH UP THE GARAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO YOU KNOW I HAVE A FEW OTHER THINGS I NEED TO DO HERE AND THEN AFTER THAT I HOPE
THAT THIS HOUSE WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO COME THROUGH AND LOOK AT IT AND THEN I WANT TO START GOING TO SOME OPEN HOUSES AND
AND UM YOU KNOW LOOK AT SOME
BUT I'VE TALKED A LOT WITH OUR REALTOR ABOUT IT AND SHE ASSURED ME WE COULD GET YOU KNOW A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE IN THE PRICE RANGE THAT WE WANT
IN THAT AREA SHE SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT AS MUCH AS THIS ONE  I SAID YEAH NO KIDDING
BUT
UM YEAH FOR THIS HOUSE IT'S JUST IN THIS AREA OF PLANO IT SEEMS THE THE HOUSES ARE MOVING REALLY QUICKLY THEY SAID MY REALTOR SAID ABOUT THREE TO SIX MONTHS AND MAYBE CLOSER TO THE THREE MONTHS BECAUSE WE LIVE

AND YOU KNOW WE'LL BE IF WE'RE REAL LUCKY WE WON'T LOSE ANY MONEY YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE IT'S MOSTLY THE CLOSING COSTS THAT ARE GOING TO
THAT Y- WE CAN WE'LL BE BE UH ASKING FOR MORE THAN WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR THREE YEARS AGO BUT THE CLOSING COSTS ARE GOING TO EAT OUT JUST ABOUT ALL OF IT SO
YEAH THEN WE'LL FEEL REALLY WE'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT

UM YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE OCCASIONAL PERSON WHO MAY HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED BUT I MEAN
UH SO FEW AND FAR BETWEEN UH YOU KNOW MAKES GOOD TV MOVIES AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I HAD MY UH MY FATHER-IN-LAW PARTICIPATED IN A UH A JURY TRIAL HE WAS HE WAS ACTUALLY ON THE JURY
AND UH THIS MAN WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING UH I THINK IT WAS TWO PEOPLE UH AND SHOOTING A UH POLICEMAN
UM POINT BLANK IN THE FACE OF COURSE HE DIDN'T DIE AND UH THIS WAS DURING A HOLDUP OF A UH UH A RESTAURANT AND IT CAME OUT DURING THE TRIAL THAT UM THEY HAD TRIED TO ROB ANOTHER PLACE
AND UH WHEN THE GUY CAME OUT WITH THE BAG THEY THOUGHT WAS MONEY IT TURNED OUT TO BE A COUPLE COOKIES
AND UH YOU KNOW JUMBO COOKIES AND AND SO THEY WERE SO UPSET FROM ROBBING THIS GUY YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO THIS HOLDUP THAT DIDN'T WORK
THAT THEY QUITE LITERALLY WERE MAD AND WENT INTO A RESTAURANT TO HOLD THE PLACE UP AND JUST STARTED YOU KNOW SHOOTING PEOPLE
YOU KNOW IT'S
YEAH
YEAH AND GET EVEN WITH WHO I MEAN YOU KNOW STUPID GUYS
AND UH IT TURNED OUT THAT THE YOU KNOW POLICEMAN SURVIVED TO THE POINT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW IDENTIFY THE GUY
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY TRIED TO MAKE THE COP LOOK OU- LIKE HE WAS UH A UH NO GOOD ROTTEN DRUNK
I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING
OH HE WAS FOUND GUILTY YEAH HE UH UM
LAST I HEARD HE UH
HE BEAT A PUSH FOR THE DEATH PENALTY NOW WHETHER THEY FINALLY GOT IT OR NOT I DON'T KNOW I KIND OF UH
STOPPED LISTENING AFTER A WHILE
UM YOU KNOW HE WOULD COME HOME AND AND YOU KNOW AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER HE CAME HOME AND TOLD US WHAT WAS GOING ON AND OF COURSE THEN THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO DEC- YOU KNOW AFTER
HE HAD TO GO
RIGHT
AND UH YEAH EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW LET'S BURN HIM
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S THE WAY THEY WANTED TO DO IT AND HE WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE HE UH YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ON THE CASE WERE
WERE A LITTLE HESITANT ON CONVICTING HIM ON SOME OF THE CHARGES BUT I MEAN WHEN IT ALL CAME DOWN THEY JUST
WITHIN AN HOUR
DECIDED THE MAN'S FATE
YEAH
HM
YEAH WELL IT IT IT WENT PRETTY PRETTY QUICK FROM WHAT HE SAID
BUT I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER CRIMES OUT THERE I MEAN BESIDES MURDER I THINK UH NOW IF YOU'RE DEALING DRUGS NOW CAUGHT MORE THAN TWICE OR SOMETHING
UH IT THERE'S UH A DEATH PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH IT
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH I AGREE
YEAH I AGREE I I'VE I HAVE UH A LOW TOLERANCE FOR THAT KIND OF UH THAT KIND OF PERSON
AND UH AS FAR AS UH YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SOME OTHER CRIMES THAT I THINK UH YOU KNOW
KIDNAPPING UM YOU KNOW WHEN THEY
I MEAN KIDNAPPING PER SE HAS A CERTAIN UH
UH
FINE AND PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT
OH WELL WHAT'S THERE TO SAY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S BEING CARRIED OUT VERY WELL IN MY OPINION
SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES SO LONG BETWEEN
CONVICTION AND CARRYING OUT THE PENALTY THAT I DON'T SEE THAT IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO SENTENCE ANYBODY
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH WELL FROM WHAT I UNDERST- I SAW A STATISTIC JUST A FEW DAYS AGO UM
SO FAR THIS YE- YEAR OR WAS IT DURING THE LAST YEAR SOMEWH- DURING A YEARS TIME I THINK IT WAS THEY EXECUTED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE IN THE NATION MEANWHILE THERE WERE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW
SO I I AND IT'S BUILDING UP YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE CONVICTING THEM FASTER THAN THEY'RE EXECUTING THEM SO IT'S REALLY BUILDING UP
UH-HUH
YEAH EVERYBODY'S GOT THAT
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
ISN'T ISN'T MARYLAND WHERE THE FAMOUS WILLY HORTON CASE WAS
IT WAS UH THAT WAS THE ONE THAT WAS USED SO MUCH IN THE CAMPAIGN
IN THE POLITICA- IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
UH MAY IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MARYLAND IT MAY HAVE BEEN MASSACHUSETTS I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYWAY WELL THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK I- IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER OR NOT A CRIMINAL COMMITS A CRIME OR DO YOU THINK IT CAN IF IT'S DONE RIGHT
IF IT
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL I THINK IN LARGE MEASURE THE REASON THEY DON'T CARE IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENT BUT SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT COMMIT CRIMES DON'T GET PUNISHED
THE POLICE DON'T CATCH THEM OR THE COURTS DON'T CONVICT THEM OR OR THEY DON'T SERVE VERY MUCH OF THE TIME AND SO UH
YOU KNOW THEIR  THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS VERY HIGH CRIME DOES PAY CA- YOU CAN MAKE A GOOD LIVING AT IT
YEAH
LAST YEAR IT WAS DC I GUESS BALTIMORE CAUGHT THEM
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS SO MANY OF THE MURDERS ARE YOU KNOW THE THE VIOLENT PEOPLE GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND SO THEY YOU KNOW SOCIETY'S NOT GOING TO PUT THEM TO DEATH WELL AT LEAST MAYBE THE GUY THEY CROSS NEXT TIME IS GOING TO
UH I THINK
I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHERE WE SAY YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF PERSON IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE TO OUR SOCIETY AND WE ARE THERE BY GOING TO REMOVE THEM FROM SOCIETY NOT TEMPORARILY BUT PERMANENTLY
I MEAN I I PERSONALLY THINK LIFE IMPRISONMENT
I DON'T THINK MUCH OF LI- OF LIFE IMPRISONMENT FIRST OF ALL IT'S NEVER TURNS OUT TO BE LIFE BUT SECOND YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE
THE IDEA OF LIFE IMPRISONMENT WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE WELL THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THEM IN A CAGE YOU THINK IT'S NEVER EVER GOING TO BE SAFE FOR THEM TO WALK THE STREETS AGAIN WELL THEN
WHY BOTHER JUST EXECUTE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S THAT WAY YOU'RE SURE THEY'LL NEVER EVER GOING TO WALK THE STREETS AGAIN
SO ANY ANY ANYBODY THAT SAYS LIFE IN PRISON WITH NO CHANCE OF PAROLE I'D SAY UH GIVE THEM THE DEATH PENALTY
SO
YEAH AND AND ALSO UM
THE
THE THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT A LOT OF THESE COURT TRIALS AND A LOT OF THESE APPEALS IS THAT IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE BUT RATHER IT'S ON THE RULES OF EVIDENCE WHAT CAN I HIDE AND WHAT DO I HAVE TO TELL
AND I THINK OUR COURTS SHOULD BE GEARED MUCH MORE STRONGLY TOWARDS FINDING OUT THE TRUTH THAN THEY CURRENTLY ARE
AND AND THAT WAY WE CAN BE SURE YOU KNOW WE CAN FIND OUT THE TRUTH WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
AND AND BASE
THE VER- SENTENCE ON WHAT THE PERSON DID NOT ON WHAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO LET THE JURY HEAR
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
JUST STARTED SHOOTING PEOPLE
BECAUSE THEY BOTCHED THE FIRST JOB AND
SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET EVEN
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
SO WHAT WAS THE VERDICT WHAT WAS THE RESULTS THERE
OH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THE THE PENALTY PHASE YEAH THEY'VE DECIDE THE PENALTY SEPARATELY FROM THE VERDICT
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHA- YOU WELL YEAH THERE'S REALLY TWO SEPARATE DECISIONS THERE I GUESS ONE IS DID IT REALLY HAPPEN THE WAY THE THE PROSECUTOR SAID IT HAPPENED
YOU KNOW IS THIS MAN REALLY GUILTY AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THAT BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER OF SOCIETY WHAT DO I WANT TO DO WITH THIS GUY WHO DID THIS THING
AND THAT W- I I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A JURY I'VE NEVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I'M NOT SURE I'D LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THAT KIND OF DECISION ABOUT A MAN'S LIFE
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL THE THING I'D BE MOST LIKELY TO ATTACH THE DEATH PENALTY TO IS THE VIOLENCE I MEAN YE- I CAN HANDLE PEOPLE PEOPLE SELLING DRUGS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S WRONG BUT
IT IT'S NOT WORTH SOMEBODY GETTING EXECUTED FOR BUT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND HOW IT'S NOT SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS BECAUSE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW THESE RANDOM DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS AND THAT SORT OF THING
AND THE PEOPLE I'D MOST LIKELY WANT TO SENTENCE TO DEATH ARE THE PEOPLE THAT JUST SHOW A REALLY LOW REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO TURN OR HURT THE NEXT PERSON BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO THEM WHETHER SOMEONE ELSE GETS HURT OR NOT
AND SO I GO LE- YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE I WOULD LIKE TO YE- GET OUT OF HERE AND GET OUT OF CIRCULATION AND SAY I DON'T WE DON'T ACCEPT YOUR KIND IN OUR SOCIETY
UH-HUH
OKAY YEAH I'M ORIGINALLY FROM NEW YORK AND I GO VISIT A LOT AND THEIR REAL ESTATE UP THERE IS I MEAN RIDICULOUS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS
AN APARTMENT HERE LIKE I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND MY APARTMENT IS THREE FIFTEEN A MONTH AND IT'S JUST THE ONE IT'S A ONE BEDROOM

YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THREE FIFTEEN OVER THERE'S PROBABLY NOT REAL REAL BAD FOR FOR WACO AND AND FOR AS MANY GOSH AS MANY AS APARTMENTS AND CONDOS ARE OVER THERE
I MEAN IT IT'S JUST AND AND ESPECIALLY AROUND LAKE SHORE AREA THAT AREA'S PICKED UP QUITE A BIT SINCE WE WERE THERE AND UH
YEAH BECAUSE I- I HAD LIVED IN THE GOSH I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE CALLED NOW BUT THEY WERE LAKE SHORE APARTMENTS THAT ARE LIKE RIGHT NEXT TO THIS BASEBALL FIELD MCC BASEBALL FIELD BUT
NO THE ONES NEXT DOOR TO THOSE THERE WERE LAKE SHORE THERE'S A I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE NOW

OH EVER NOW AND THEN UM IT JUST WE
IT'S UH YEAH AND IT'S NOT REALLY NOW THAT IT'S SIXTY FIVE IT DOESN'T TAKE HARDLY ANYTIME TO GET THERE YOU KNOW RUN TO THE MALL OR RUN TO SAM'S OR
WHATEVER WE USED TO RUN TO R- YOU KNOW RED LOBSTER BUT NOW THEY'VE GOT ONE IN KILLEEN SO WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN THAT FAR SO THAT'S THAT'S ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE AND THE SEEMS LIKE THE MARKET HERE'S PICKING UP YEAH I REALLY THINK IT IS
JUST FOR THE FACT THAT THE
YOU KNOW IT'S
IT SEEMED LIKE AS SOON AS WE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE
WE SAW ALL THESE HOUSES FOR SALE YOU KNOW AND I THINK NOW A LOT OF THEM ARE SELLING AND A LOT OF SELLERS ARE GETTING CLOSE TO WHAT THEY WANT INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW JUST HAVING TO GIVE IT AWAY
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I- I SAW I SEE THAT A LOT TOO THERE AND IT'S NICE TOO I LIKED LIVING THERE
UH-HUH
WELL I GUESS WE CHEWED UP THE HOUSE MARKET AND APARTMENT MARKET FOR A WHILE
YOU TOO TANYA ALL RIGHT BYE-BYE
SO UM YOU SAID YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS BUT UM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YES YES I HAVE ONE SON WHO'S NOW UH EIGHTEEN AND HE'S A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE
AND IT IT DOES BUT I WAS VERY LUCKY IN THAT I WAS UM TEACHING AT A UNIVERSITY AND SO BASICALLY AND LIVED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE
SO I WAS ABLE WHEN HE WAS LITTLE JUST TO UM LEAVE HIM WITH A NEIGHBOR IN UH ONE OF THESE CARRY COTS
AND THEN GO UP AND TEACH A CLASS AND COME BACK
BECAUSE I COULD DO MY WORK AT HOME AND MY MY STUDENTS WHO WERE WORKING ON THEIR MASTER'S DEGREES AND STUFF WOULD COME TO MY HOUSE AND I WOULD MEET WITH THEM THERE
SO IT WAS REALLY IDEAL AND THEN LATER ON UM WHEN HE WAS GEE MAYBE TWO AND THREE I ACTUALLY TOOK HIM THEN I CHANGED TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL BUT IT WAS STILL WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE
AND UM HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN MY OFFICE BECAUSE I WAS UH DEPARTMENT CHAIRMAN
AND UM YOU KNOW REALLY DIDN'T INTERFERE BECAUSE ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD SORT OF BEEN USED TO THERE WERE QUIET TIMES
AND SO AND THAT WORKED OUT GREAT
YES
YES HE'S COMMUTING IT'S UM ABOUT
GEE HE COMMUTES FORTY FIVE MINUTES A EACH WAY BUT HE HAS TO ALLOW AN HOUR AND A HALF GOING TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S TOO TOO CHANCY FOR HIM TO MISS CLASSES
AND SO ACTUALLY WE DON'T I MEAN WE STILL SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER IN THE SENSE THAT WE ARE ALWAYS TOGETHER FOR DINNER AND AND
UM THEN YOU KNOW HE'S IN THE HOUSE STUDYING IN THE EVENING
AND HE ALSO WORKS AND SO UM HE USUALLY CALLS ME
AT WHEN HE GETS HOME FROM SCHOOL AT NOON I MEAN NOT NOT CHECKING IN BUT MORE GEE YOU KNOW MISSED YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THIS IS WHAT'S NEW TYPE OF THING AND I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP FROM THAT STANDPOINT BUT I THINK IT'S
UNUSUAL AND I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT THAT WE WERE ABROAD FOR A GOOD PART OF THE TIME
UNTIL TILL UM SIX YEARS AGO
WELL I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
SO
YEAH
BILINGUAL YES YEAH ACTUALLY UM
HE HE WAS MORE IN A SENSE RAISED TRILINGUAL IN THAT I SPOKE SPANISH TO HIM WHEN HE WAS A BABY
AND THEN BUT HE ALWAYS ANSWERED IN ARABIC BECAUSE HE HEARD MORE ARABIC THAN SPANISH
AND THEN WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO VISIT MY MOTHER HE PICKED UP ENGLISH WHEN HE WAS TWO AND A HALF
AND HE HAD HEARD ME TALK ENGLISH ON THE PHONE BUT YOU KNOW HE HADN'T HE REALLY DIDN'T USE IT
SO
OH
WHERE ARE YOU FROM
OH OKAY
UM-HUM
CAUSE YOU THEY WERE NEWLY IN THIS COUNTRY
AH
UM-HUM
WHERE WERE THEY WHERE THEY WHAT VILLAGE
OH FROM DAMASCUS OKAY
OH OKAY
UM-HUM
YEAH BUT SEE THERE'S A BIG BIG ISSUE THERE BECAUSE MY MY FAMILY SPOKE GERMAN AT HOME SO THAT WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
AND AND MY UM NIECES AND NEPHEWS ARE NOT LEARNING THEIR MOTHER'S LANGUAGE
SO THAT I THINK THIS IS A A TENDENCY IN THE STATES IS BECAUSE IT'S A MELTING POT SO I THINK MY SON HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF WE WERE ACTUALLY LIVING OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY
SO THERE WAS A REASON FOR HIM TO LEARN IT
YEAH IT'S REALLY HARD
WELL I'M NOT SO SURE THAT IT'S THE THE ACADEMICS AS MUCH AS SPENDING TIME WITH HIM
AND I'VE BEEN CONCERNED IN THE STATES SINCE I'VE BEEN BACK WITH THE NUMBER PARTICULARLY IN THE WASHINGTON AREA WHERE I LIVE NOW
UM  WITH A SEEING HOW MANY KIDS COME HOME TO EMPTY HOUSES AND LIKE IN OUR COURT WE LIVE IN OUR TOWNHOUSE COURT
AND THERE'S SEVEN YEAR OLDS THAT COME HOME AND THEY'RE LOCKED OUT
AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS SORT OF FEEL SORR- SORRY FOR THEM AN- AND
YOU KNOW WOULD BE VERY RESPONSIBLE IF SOMETHING HAPPENED BUT THE PARENTS AREN'T WILLING TO TO PAY THAT PERSON TO SORT OF BE IN CHARGE AND AND I THINK THIS IS
I YOU KNOW I'VE JUST SEEN SO MUCH OF IT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT YOU WOULDN'T SEE IN IN CERTAINLY NOT IN THE ARAB CULTURE I MEAN
PEO- PEOPLE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THINGS SO
HE'S A TERROR WELL HE'S A TERROR HE JUST YOU KNOW CLIMBS ON CARS WALKS AROUND THE COURT THREATENING PEOPLE WITH STICKS
YEAH IT
RIGHT NOW WOULD YOU CONTINUE DO YOU WORK NOW
OH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM UM-HUM
RIGHT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT RIGHT THAT Y- HE'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT
RIGHT ACTUALLY WE TRAVELED EXTENSIVELY BECAUSE I WAS DOING ARCHEOLOGY AND SO
YOU KNOW HE WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO COME WITH ME ON ALL MY TRAVELS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PLACES I WENT BY CAR OF COURSE
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW I WAS LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND I TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE AND AND YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T DISLIKE TRAVEL NOW HE MIGHT NOT LIKE IT
UH YOU KNOW HE MIGHT NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO TRAVEL BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN A LOT BUT HE'S VERY COMFORTABLE TRAVELING
AND SO
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT YES I THINK SO I THINK SO
SO
NO
NO AND AND AND I FIND THAT INTERESTING BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TWO YEARS AHEAD IN THE SCHOOLS HERE
AND SO HE ALWAYS YOU KNOW WAS TREATED LIKE LITTLE BROTHER WHEN THE BAND NEEDED TRANSPORTATION THEY'D SAY OH HE CAN'T DRIVE SO
YOU KNOW WHEN HE'S A SENIOR HE CAN DRIVE SOME OF THE THE YOUNGER KIDS AROUND TYPE OF THING
AND HE DI- HE DIDN'T GET HIS LI- I MEAN HE WAS JUST SIXTEEN WHEN HE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL SO
YOU KNOW HE HE HAS FRIENDS BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY YOU KNOW HE HASN'T REALLY GOTTEN INTO THE SOCIAL THING
AND  HE'S I THINK THAT'S ALL RIGHT HE'S GOING TO IT LOOKS LIKE FINISH HIS DEGREE FIRST BEFORE HE GETS TOO INVOLVED
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP UP I MEAN KIDS APPRECIATE IT MORE IF YOU DON'T
I THINK IF IF THINGS ARE SPECIAL AND ARE FOR THEM THEY SEE THAT THEIR KIDS ARE BEING BOUGHT
THAT THEIR FRIENDS ARE BEING BOUGHT BY THEIR PARENTS
UH-HUH AND THEY DON'T NEED THEM AND THEY DON'T EVEN APPRECIATE THEM
I MEAN THAT'S MY FEELING I THINK YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST
IT'S A TOKEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ME SO YOU HAVE ALL THESE MATERIAL THINGS
UM-HUM
OH VERY GOOD AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE GOOD VALUES AND
WELL YEAH AND UM ACTUALLY I'M VERY INTERESTED WE ARE MY HUSBAND AND I ARE THINKING VERY SOON UM ABOUT HAVING CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT I AM JUST UM
A LITTLE BIT
UH BRAINWASHED OR WHATEVER BY JUST THINKING THAT KIDS ARE SO WONDERFUL AND CUTE AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE ONE AND I DON'T SEE THE REAL RESPONSIBILITY OF IT
UM AND AN ACTUALLY HOW DRAMATICALLY
YOUR LIFE CAN CHANGE WHEN YOU DO HAVE CHILDREN

WELL MY PARENTS WERE BORN HERE MY GRANDPARENTS MOVED HERE UM
AND THEN HAD MY PARENTS SHORTLY AFTER THEY MOVED HERE
IN DAMASCUS
UM-HUM FROM DAMASCUS ALL OF THEM ACTUALLY
AND UM I JUST I THINK IT'S A REAL SHAME BECAUSE NOW I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE AND I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY YOU KNOW AT MY AGE TO START LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A  KID YOU JUST PICK IT UP SO NATURALLY
UM-HUM
OH REALLY
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR BEING IN ACADEMICS UM HELPED YOUR SON

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH

UM-HUM
OH JEEZ

UH-HUH
YEAH OH NO THAT FOR SURE
AND THEN EVERY- WONDERS WHY WHY LIKE YOU SAID THAT SEVEN YEAR OLD YOU KNOW WHY TWO MONTHS FROM NOW HE'S ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING
OH REALLY

OH WELL HE HAS NO DISCIPLINE I MEAN NO ONE IS THERE TO TELL HIM WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG
YES I DO I WORK FULL TIME AND MY HUSBAND ACTUALLY IS GOING FOR HIS PHD AND UH WOULD LIKE TO TEACH
AND BE A PROFESSOR UM HOPEFULLY SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH I- I I'M FROM
BOSTON AND I I'M FED UP WITH THE COLD WEATHER REALLY BETWEEN BOSTON AND ROCHESTER
BUT UM IDEALLY I WOULD UM I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BE HOME FOR A YEAR
AND I REALLY JUST SELFISHLY DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT
AND UM YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND'S SCHEDULE HOPEFULLY WILL BE FLEXIBLE UM
IN THAT HE COULD DO A LOT OF HIS WORK AT HOME
AND UM I'M NOT SURE I I STILL WANT TO WORK I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO KEEP THAT UP AND I DON'T WANT TO UM YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO GO SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
BUT UM
BUT I THINK THAT HIM BEING UM A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE WITH HIS SCHEDULE WILL REALLY HELP US OUT A LOT
SO THAT THAT'S NICE THING ABOUT TEACHING
RIGHT AND I IMAGINE THAT OBVIOUSLY YOUR SUMMERS WERE A LOT LIGHTER AS FAR AS WORK LOAD
OH
OH WOW
UM-HUM

TO THINK ABOUT RAISING A CHILD BESIDES JUST THE THE ESSENTIALS YOU KNOW CLOTHES AND FOOD AND THIS AND THAT
I REALLY FEEL LIKE THERE'S THIS WHOLE UM YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE JONES OR WHATEVER THEY SAY AND UH YOU KNOW IT JUST SEEM LIKE WHEN I YOU KNOW WATCH

YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
NO NO I THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER THAT'S FOR SURE OR ELSE THEY WOULD'VE UH DONE SOMETHING BY NOW I GUESS
BUT UH
AND PROBABLY THE ONLY OTHER THING I CAN THINK OF IN THE LAST UH OH TWENTY YEARS OR SO I GUESS IS THAT UH FAMILY STRUCTURES HAVE CHANGED A LOT
UM-HUM THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH IT DOESN'T SEEM THE NORM TO HAVE UH HAVE PARENTS AND AND UH THE TWO WHAT TWO POINT FIVE KIDS AND ALL THAT UH
YEAH
TRUE
YEAH
BUT IT IT IT'S SAD THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOSING THE GRANDPARENTS AND THE UNCLES THAT THAT FAM- YOU KNOW BEYOND THAT FAMILIES DON'T SEEM TO GET CLOSE ANYMORE
AND THAT'S PROBABLY GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE MIGRATORY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I- I THINK THAT'S UH VERY RARE ANYMORE THAT UH DEFINITELY PEOPLE AREN'T AT FAMILY REUNIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND UH AND A LOT OF THEM I GUESS DON'T DO IT AT ALL SO
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG LONG TIME SINCE OUR FAMILY EVER DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO
THAT'S TRUE
UM-HUM
IT'S IT'S IT'S EASIER TO TO FIGHT I GUESS WHEN YOU CAN FIND THEM  I REMEMBER THAT WAS THE THE PROBLEM BACK THEN YOU JUST COULDN'T FIND THEM
YEAH I MEAN UH NOT NOT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM

MORE OF A
MORE INFORMATION PROCESSING YEAH
UM-HUM

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING PROBABLY YEAH
UM-HUM
OKAY UH WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UH INDUSTRIES TRENDS EVERYTHING
OKAY
ALL RIGHT WE'LL START TWENTY YEARS BACK AND COME FORWARD HOW'S THAT SOUND
ALL RIGHT
WELL YEAH I THINK THEY HAVE I- I REALLY DO AND IT'S IT'S NO LONGER THE ISSUE IT ONCE WAS AND I'M KIND OF GLAD LEAST I- I HOPE THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT UH
UH THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED UH MO- TO THE MORE EQUITABLE AT LEAST
UH YEAH I THINK THEY HAVE TOO I DON'T THINK WOMEN'S RIGHTS HAVE COME AS FAR
UH I- I THINK THAT UH IN GENERAL WOMEN WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY STILL SORT OF GETTING THE BUM DEAL
COMPARED TO UH SAY SOME OF THE MINORITY GROUPS
UH I KNOW MY WIFE WOULD
YEAH BUT UH I DON'T KNOW UH SEEMS LIKE WE COME UH A LONG WAYS IN TERMS OF  THE ECONOMIES OF OF THINGS UH
IF I RECALL BACK IN THE SIXTIES WE DIDN'T TEND TO RUN A DEBT ALL THE TIME BUT WE DID RUN A DEBT A LOT WITH THE GREAT SOCIETY A LOT SEVENTIES AND SO FORTH
AND THEN UH IT LOOKED LIKE WE JUST STAYED IN SOME SORT OF A E- E- ECONOMIC MORASS EVER SINCE
HELLO WE'RE THERE
RIGHT I CAN REM-
YEAH I CAN REMEMBER IN THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES YOU COULDN'T EVEN UH HARDLY FIND A JAPANESE CAR AROUND
AND UH WHAT FEW THERE WERE AROUND WERE VERY UGLY LOOKING THINGS MUST'VE BEEN
YEAH YEAH THEY MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY RELIABLE THOUGH BECAUSE SOME OF THEM THEY BUILT UP A FAIRLY GOOD FOLLOWING AND IT APPEARS THAT'S THE CASE DO YOU OWN ANY KIND OF FOREIGN CAR
I DON'T EITHER I'VE ALWAYS JUST UH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CALL IT BUY AMERICAN IT'S JUST THAT I'VE ALWAYS BOUGHT FORDS AND I GUESS I'LL JUST KEEP BUYING FORDS
UH BUT
WELL
SOME OF THE ETHICAL ASPECTS OF POLITICAL LIFE CERTAINLY SEEM TO HAVE GONE DOWNHILL AND CERTAIN
YEAH IN CERTAIN RESPECTS I FEEL LIKE THAT THE UH
UH REAGAN ADMINISTRATION COMING RIGHT OFF THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION DID TEND TO BRING BACK A MORE AGGRESSIVE UH
UH ASPECT TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND THE SORT OF THINGS THAT DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS REALLY STOOD FOR AND AND YOU KNOW AND UH BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE LIMELIGHT COMPARED TO THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES
AND I THINK THAT WAS A POSITIVE UH POSITIVE THING BUT IT SEEMS LIKE UH
UH WITH ALL THAT UH WE NEVER SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET OUR HOUSE IN ORDER WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMIC THINGS I- I BRING THIS BACK TO THAT AT LEAST UH IT SEEMS LIKE WE STILL CONTINUE TO RUN UH
UH HEAVY UH IN- INDEBTED BUDGETS AND THE LIKE I DON'T SEE ANY REAL WAY OUT OF IT EITHER I MIGHT ADD
YEAH WELL
YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT'S TRUE
YEAH I THINK THEY HAVE TOO SEEMS LIKE THAT UH THE COUNTRY'S MI- BEEN MORE UH MIGRATORY
AND FAM- THE THE OLD FAMILY STRUCTURE OF THE MOTHERS AND THE GRANDMOTHERS AND THE GRANDFATHERS MAYBE EVEN SOME GREAT GRANDPARENTS OCCASIONALLY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BROKEN APART PRETTY PRETTY WELL INCLUDING THE FAMILY STRUCTURE AS A UNIT ITSELF
YEAH WELL I HOPE THAT'S NOT RIGHT I DO I DO HEAR THESE STATISTICS SAME AS YOU DO AND UH AND UH I- I- I ALWAYS FELT LIKE AT LEAST THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY UNIT MOTHER FATHER AND CHILDREN
WAS A COHESIVE STRUCTURE THAT WAS HEALTHY AND WAS A INTEGRAL PART OF WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY
I DON'T KNOW SORT OF A STABLE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINE UH UH I DON'T KNOW SOME NOT NECESSARY DISCIPLINE BUT CERT- SOCIAL ORDER THAT'S IT AND I- I
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH IN MY MY FAMILY I KNOW MOST OF US ARE SOUTHERNERS JUST HAPPEN TO BE LIVING UP IN MARYLAND THOUGH BUT MY FAMILY UH WE'RE
WE SORT OF LIKE OUR ROOTS AND LIKE TO GET BACK AND HAVE FAMILY REUNIONS AND ALL THAT
AND I THINK THAT MAY NOT BE THE NORM FOR S- A LOT OF PEOPLE AS MUCH AS IT IS FOR US THAT DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I MUST SAY TOO IT SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE FLAVOR OF UH WAR HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT BACK AT THE VIETNAM ERA
AND WHAT ALL WE WENT THROUGH THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE IRAQI SITUATION IT SEEMS LIKE UH WE HAVE UH MADE UH UH UH A A RATHER
UH MAJOR ABOUT FACE IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE CONDUCT WAR AND THE WAY WE WE UH CAN TECHNOLOGICALLY UH UH CARRY OUT A WAR
THEY'RE A LITTLE HARD TO HIDE IN THAT DESERT
WELL UH THEN TOO I THINK THE PHILOSOPHY IS CHANGED I WAS JUST READING TONIGHT IN THE ONE OF THE NEWS MAGAZINES THAT YOU CAN TAKE YOU KNOW I- I- I TAKE NEWSWEEK TIME AND US NEWS AND WOR- WORLD REPORT ALL THREE AS A MATTER OF FACT
AND UH I WAS JUST READING IN ONE OF THE UH THE THOSE NEWS MAGAZINES THAT UH THERE'S A UM
A MOVEMENT AMONG CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT THE UPPER HIERARCHY UH UH UH OFFICER STAFF
TO UH CHANGE THE KIND OF WAY WE CONDUCTED WAR IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF UH INSTEAD OF MEETING THE EN- THE ENEMY SORT OF HEAD ON INSTEAD OF DOING MORE FEINTING AND AND AND AND TECHNOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE TACTICS LIKE THESE SMART BOMBS AND THINGS LIKE THAT DOING MORE
MORE SMART THINGS THAT ARE VERY DAMAGING GETTING IN GETTING OUT UH MAKING END RUNS ALLOWING MORE CREATIVITY AT THE LOWER ECHELON LEVELS FOR PEOPLE TO SLIP IN SLIP OUT AND DO THINGS
THAN UH HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST WHERE THE IDEA WAS TO MEET YOUR ENEMY SORT OF HEAD ON AND THE LIKE AND I THINK POLITICALLY WE'VE CHANGED A LOT I THINK IN THE VIETNAM WAR
UH WE WE CONGRESS GOT TOO MUCH INVOLVED IN IN TRYING TO MANAGE THE WAR
YEAH AND THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG WAY TO TO GO TO CONDUCT A WAR IN MY OPINION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN A WAR RIGHT OR WRONG YOU SHOULD LET THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT HANDLE IT AND AND AND GIVE THEM THE JOB THAT THEY'RE PAID AND SUPPOSEDLY SKILLED AT DOING
AND LET THEM GET ON WITH IT INSTEAD OF TYING THEIR HANDS WHICH I FELT LIKE WAS NOT THE CASE IN THE VIETNAM WAR BUT WAS ENTIRELY THE OPPOSITE IN THE CASE OF THE IRAQI WAR
WHERE THEY MORE OR LESS GAVE IT TO SCHWARTZKOPF AND AND THE REST OF THE MILITARY UNITS AND JUST SAYS HEY LOOK HANDLE IT AND THEY DID
AND I THINK THE MILITARY PROVED ITSELF COMPETENT TO DO EXACTLY WHAT IT'S PAID TO DO AND UH IT JUST GOES TO GIVE ME A A A FEELING THAT UH WE DID SOME THINGS WRONG
I THINK IN THE VIETNAM ERA UH AND THAT UH CONGRESS SHOULD HAVE STAYED OUT OF IT MUCH AS POSSIBLE
BUT UH THAT I SEE AS A CHANGE AND THEN INDUSTRIALLY GOING BACK UH I- I THINK UH UH INDUSTRIALLY WE'VE CHANGED I THINK WE'VE COME THROUGH AN ERA OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS OR SO TWENTY TEN OF A UH A
A NATION THAT WAS INDUSTRIALLY ORIENTED TOWARDS UH MANUFACTURING TYPE INDUSTRIES AND I THINK NOW WE SEEING OURSELVES TRANSITIONING INTO A MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ELECTRONICS AGE WHERE IT'S
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION AND AND COMPUTERS THAT IS REALLY OUR NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
AND UH YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME THE LEAST LITTLE BIT IF WE DIDN'T SEE THE WHOLE IDEA OF MANUFACTURE OF AUTOMOBILES AND THE LIKE EXCEPT TO SOME DEGREE WE HAVE TO KEEP A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERTISE IN THE HOUSE THAT BEING A BASE EXPORT TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND YOU MAY F- MIGHT FIND EVEN JAPAN AND
AND UH UH MAJOR POWERS LIKE UH THE THE BRITISH AND THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN ECONOMIES BEING LESS AND LESS DEPENDENT UPON THAT KIND OF INDUSTRY
UH BECAUSE IT'S UH SOMEWHAT LABOR INTENSIVE EVEN IF THEY START ROBOTIZING IT UH I- I- I I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE INSTEAD THE MORE
UH ADVANCED NATIONS WOULD TEND TO GET MORE COMPUTERIZED MORE TELECOMMUNICATION ORIENTED AND THE LIKE AND INFORMATION IS IS GETTING TO BE UH SORT OF THE THING
I- I- I THINK I DON'T KNOW
UM-HUM YEAH I- I THINK I- I- I- I THINK WE'RE MADE SOME MISTAKES TOO FOR EX- I THINK THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT REALLY KEPT ABREAST OF WHAT'S GOING ON INDUSTRIALLY
AND UH I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I WAS TALKING ABOUT I'VE SAID FOR YEARS BECAUSE I- I MY BACKGROUND'S IN PHYSICS AND UH I'VE SAID FOR YEARS THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT REACTED
TO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL UH UH UH INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTIONARY STATE OF THE COUNTRY AND BY THAT I MEAN WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL YOU GOT YOUR BASIC SCIENCES
AND UH THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH ABOUT IT
AND UH WHEN I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL I HAD TO SORT OF TEACH MYSELF EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED UH ABOUT COMPUTERS AND PROGRAMMING AND AND JUST YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BIT HARDWARE IN GENERAL RELATIVE TO WHY YOU CAN DO THINGS WITH DATA ACQUISITION PROCESS AND THE LIKE
AND UH WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL YOU HAD TO HAVE MATHEMATICS IF YOU WERE IN ENGINEERING OR SCIENCE OR ANY OF THE OTHER SCIENTIFIC FIELDS CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AND THE LIKE
BUT YOU NEVER HAD TO HAVE COMPUTERS AND EVEN TO THIS DATE IN COLLEGES IT'S NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE COMPUTER COURSES IF YOU'RE IN IN THE ENGINEERING OR THE SCIENCE FIELDS
UNLESS YOU'RE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST OR OR OR SOMEONE IN THAT AREA AND THEN IT IS REQUIRED OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE CURRICULUM AND UH JUST AS WE HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR OF ENGLISH IN IN IN COLLEGES AND A YEAR OF SOME SORT OF SOCIAL STUDY
HAVE YOU RUN INTO ANY PROBLEMS WITH INVASION OF PRIVACY THERE
UM
OH WELL THAT EXPLAINS THAT I GOT ONE THE OTHER DAY THEY THEY DID THAT UH IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PHONE CALL FROM SOMEWHERE AND THEY PUT ME ON A DEAD LINE FOR
OH IT MUST HAVE BEEN MINUTES AND I SAID WELL IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT IMPORTANT AND I WOUND UP HANGING UP AND I'VE I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THAT WAS
UM
YEAH YO- YOU DON'T MIND THEM
NO MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR ME WILL TRY TO GET A HOLD OF ME AT WORK THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN PIN ME DOWN
AND UH SO ABOUT ANY IMPORTANT PHONE CALL THAT I HAVE I'M GOING TO GET IT AT WORK AND IF THE PHONE CALL COMES TO THE HOUSE CHANCES ARE IT'S EITHER FOR MY WIFE OR ONE OF THE GIRLS
AND SO I JUST DO NOT ANSWER THE PHONE CALL YOU KNOW I'LL LET IT RING UNTIL SOMEBODY ELSE ANSWERS IT AND IF THEY SAY DAD IT'S FOR YOU
I SAYS WHAT ARE THEY SELLING  AND I'D SAY NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME IF THE CALLS FOR ME AT HOME IT'S SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO SELL ME SOME OIL LEASES OR SOME
SOME UH GRAVE SITES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM
I CONSIDER THAT TO BE THE INVASION OF PRIVACY PARTICULARLY WHEN I'M SITTING DOWN AT THE DINNER TABLE AND THEY GIVE ME A CALL AND I- I HAVE TO ANSWER THIS PHONE TO FIND OUT THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHING AND MY DINNER'S GETTING COLD
YEAH
WELL I THINK FOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY REALIZE THAT MOST PEOPLE WORK AND THAT THAT PROBABLY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE WORK AND SO THERE'S NOBODY HOME EXCEPT MAYBE SCHOOL KIDS AFTER SCHOOL
AND SO THEY MIGHT AS WELL NOT EVEN TRY YOU KNOW NOT EVEN TIE UP PEOPLE DIALING PHONE NUMBERS EXCEPT IN THE EVENING
FORTUNATELY THEY HAVE UH SUFFICIENT RESPECT THAT THEY DON'T CALL AFTER TEN O'CLOCK AND THEY DON'T CALL BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IF I GOT A PHONE CALL AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IT WAS SOMEBODY TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHING I WOULD CALL THE PHONE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY AND LIST THEM AS A NUISANCE CALL
YEAH
BUT I THINK THAT'S ABOUT THE BIGGEST INVASION OF PRIVACY WE HAVE UH THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS BUT UH I PRESUME THAT THEY HAVE LEGITIMATE PURPOSES
YEAH THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO INTERVENE QUITE A BIT UH ONE OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS I HAVE IS UH HAVE YOU EVER CHECKED YOUR CREDIT WITH THE CREDIT BUREAU
YOU OUGHT TO DO THAT IT'S INTERESTING THA- TO SEE WHO HAS INQUIRED ABOUT YOUR UH FINANCES IS UH THEY'RE REQUIRED TO KEEP TRACK AND FOR I THINK ABOUT THE PRECEDING YEAR
AND IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHO HAS UH CALLED AND INQUIRE ABOUT YOUR CREDIT THERE'S QUITE A FEW COMPANIES THAT UH WANT TO SEND YOU CREDIT CARDS OR UH OR CHARGE CARDS YOU KNOW WILL ASK FOR A UH CREDIT DUMP AND THEN
SEND YOU A LETTER TRYING TO GET YOU TO TAKE THEIR CREDIT CARD OPEN A CHARGE ACCOUNT WITH SOME COMPANY
YEAH
UM
YEAH THAT TAKES SOME PAPERWORK TO GET STRAIGHTENED OUT
YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL THERE ARE UH LISTS THAT GO BY ZIP CODES
AND UH A LOT OF COMPANIES WILL TARGET PEOPLE FOR SPECIFIC ZIP CODES BECAUSE OF UH YOU KNOW IF YOU LIVE IN THE ELTON REGION OR GREAT FALLS AREA OF FAIRFAX COUNTY OR OR MONTGOMERY COUNTY IN MARYLAND
UH YOU'RE A PRIME CANDIDATE TO BE LIVING IN A RICH HOUSE AND UH AND SPEND MONEY ON FOOLISH THINGS SO UH THAT GETS YOU ON A MAILING LIST FOR JAGUARS AND ROLLS ROYCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM  WELL THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE NEWS JUST THIS MORNING THAT UH SOMEBODY IN DOING THEIR
UH MASTER'S DISSERTATION OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE UH DID A STUDY
OF UH CREDIT CARD REPORTS OR OR CREDIT REPORTS AND THEY FOUND THAT SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY PERCENT OF THEM HAVE ERRONEOUS DATA IN THERE
UH DATA THAT WOULD PREVENT THAT PERSON FROM GETTING A LOAN IN THE FUTURE OR OR GETTING A CREDIT ADVANCE AND UH THE INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUS
SO UH I- I THINK EVERYBODY RECOMMENDS THAT UH WELL THEY'VE THEY THE UH STORY THIS MORNING ON THE RADIO SUGGESTED YOU OUGHT TO DO THIS ABOUT ONCE A YEAR BUT I FIGURE ABOUT ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS IS GOOD ENOUGH
UH IT'S ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS YEAH IT'S FAIRLY CHEAP
YEAH WELL I HAD IT DONE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WASN'T ANY WRONG INFORMATION IN THERE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE ALL RIGHT
WELL APPARENT APPARENTLY NOT NOT IF YOU UH APPROACH THE PEOPLE AND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE INTERESTED IN KEEPING THEIR RECORDS ACCURATE
BUT UH IT'S JUST NICE TO MAKE SURE THAT NO UH
UH STRANGE RECORDS SHOW UP
THERE WAS ONE CASE I THINK HERE RECENTLY WHERE SOME FELLOW DOWN IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA UH WOUND UP BEING ARRESTED FOR UH FAILURE TO PROVIDE CHILD SUPPORT
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN AND HE HAD A HECK OF A TIME CONVINCING THE AUTHORITIES THAT HE WASN'T THE THE PARTY THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR FAILING TO MAKE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS
YEAH
ALL RIGHTY
THANK YOU BYE
WELL WHAT I CONSIDER INVASION OF WELL MAYBE IT'S JUST INVASION OF MY PRIVATE TIME IS I- WE GET A LOT OF THOSE COMPUTER GENERATED UH TELEPHONE CALLS
WHERE THEY JUST YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THE LIST AND WHENEVER YOU PICK UP THE PHONE IT'S A RECORDING AND THERE  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HOLD ON FOR A VERY IMPORTANT PHONE CALL AND I FEEL THAT IF IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY WOULD UH BE THERE INSTEAD OF PUTTING ME ON HOLD
YEAH WE UH I DON'T KNOW W- WHY IT IS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY OF THOSE THAT UM INSTEAD OF THE THE SA- USUAL SALES CALLS THAT YOU GET THAT THEY UM
BUT WILL JUST RUN THROUGH THE LIST AND I GUESS WAIT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO HANG ON TO TALK TO THEM BUT UH YEAH TH- WE GET A LOT OF THOSE
ALMOST SORT OF LIKE THESE TI PHONE CALLS NO  THESE ARE BENEFICIAL TOO TOO UH FOR PERSONAL UH BENEFIT HERE SO

PUBLIC UH UH VOICE ABOUT IT THAT UH WE WOULDN'T GO FOR THAT
UM-HUM
RIGHT AND WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT IT IS UM AND THEY DON'T I MEAN ALL IT IS IS THEY JUST GO THROUGH DOWN A LIST OF NUMBERS I MEAN THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY'RE CALLING IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE UH IT THEY'RE JUST A HAPHAZARD UM
UH AT IT SO I DON'T KNOW

I MEAN I EVEN MY SOCIAL LIFE IS RENTING MOVIES OR SITTING AT HOME AND YOU KNOW WATCHING A RENTED MOVIE OR WATCHING A MOVIE ON TV
AND JUST NOW IT'S SO I MEAN EV- EVERYTHING IS JUST SO UH EASY THAT YOU ALMOST DON'T HAVE TO THINK OF THINGS TO DO ANYMORE

TO THINK THAT THAT WAS THE SOCIAL LIFE OF TEENAGERS TO GO TO UH YOU KNOW A A PLACE LIKE ARNOLD'S AND ORDER A SODA POP
AND UH YOU KNOW SIT AND HANG OUT AND AND YOU KNOW JUST THE DRESS CODES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE THE WHOLE ATTITUDE OF TEENAGERS AND SOCIAL LIFE WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THEN
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
I KNOW
I KNOW AND ALSO UM I THINK THAT IT'S SO MUCH MORE DANGEROUS FOR PEOPLE NOW
I MEAN BEFORE YOU COULD GO OUT AND AND YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE DRUNK DRIVERS AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS GETTING INTO THE WRONG CROWDS AND THIS AND THAT

ONE THING I LOVE TO DO AND MAYBE IT'S JUST  BECAUSE I LIKE TO EAT
BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO WITH FRIENDS IS JUST GO OUT AND TRY A NEW RESTAURANT
AND UH AND I DON'T KNOW JUST GO AND I DON'T KNOW TRY LIKE A A NEW ETHNIC RESTAURANT YOU KNOW INDIAN FOOD OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

ARE THAT AREN'T REALLY SOCIAL LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO A MOVIE YOU'RE NOT SITTING AND TALKING TO ANYBODY
AND WHEN YOU GO TO A BAR IT'S USUALLY SO LOUD OR SO CROWDED THAT YOU EVEN THAT YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANYBODY
YOU KNOW UM AND GOING OUT TO DINNER I THINK IS A NICE WAY YOU'RE OUT YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOUSE UM
I THINK PLAYING GAMES IS SOMETHING THAT MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE TO DO
WE'VE UM WE'VE BOUGHT PICTIONARY YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT AND I DON'T KNOW SOME OTHER GAMES AND UM AND I KNOW THIS SOUNDS KIND OF CORNY BUT
IT REALLY IS
AND IF YOU GET THE RIGHT GROUP OF FRIENDS
THEY HAVE A GOOD ATTITUDE ABOUT IT THEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TIME

LIKE A RADIO SHOW JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE FROM THE OLD DAYS AND I WAS THINKING GOSH THAT'S I MEAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT EVERYBODY LOOKS LIKE AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY HEAR IT AND HAVE TO DO IT AND IT'S I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S JUST TOO BAD THAT EVERYBODY HAS EVERYTHING FED TO THEM

OH JUST A LOT OF TIMES WE DO SIT AROUND AND
BECAUSE LIKE UH I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I'M IN LIKE UH THE CLASSES UH LIKE HONORS CLASSES AND SO IT'S LIKE WHAT'S REALLY GOOD ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU MEET PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE INTERESTED IN IN TALKING ABOUT THINGS AND DISCUSSING WORLD ISSUES AND
IT JUST AND IT MAKES ME SICK TO GO TO SCHOOL AND KNOW PEOPLE WHO JUST THAT'S ALL THEY DO IS LIKE GO OUT AND  YOU KNOW TRY TO GO FIND A NEW GUY OR SOMETHING IT'S JUST SO IMMATURE AND OH JUST FUTILE YOU KNOW

OH YEAH
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
OH THAT'S THE TRUTH
YEAH NICE TALKING TO YOU
YEAH
TALK TO YOU LATER BYE
WELL WE UH UH THIS WILL BE UH UH THE REUNION FOR NOT MY GRANDFATHER BUT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER AND THEN MY GREAT AND THEN MY GRANDFATHERS SO IT'S A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS
UM AND THESE WERE PIONEERS WHO CAME ACROSS THE PLAINS
AND UH THE FAMILIES WERE ARE QUITE LARGE AND SO WE'VE HA- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO GATHER UP
UH NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF ALL THE TONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED
AND SO IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND PLANNING
UM GOOD ACTIVITY THE WHAT
WELL INTERESTING ENOUGH WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT OVER AN EIGHT DAY PERIOD
UH THEY WILL NOT EVERYONE WON'T BE THERE FOR THE WHOLE TIME BUT THE FAMILIES CAN COME IN DURING THAT EIGHT DAY TIME AND KIND OF MEET ON THE ON THE LIVING FAMILY LEVEL
LIKE I WILL COME THERE KIND OF EARLY AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL COME SO THAT WE CAN GET ACQUAINTED AND THEN
UH IT GOES BACK THE THE GENERATION BEFORE WILL JOIN US AND THEY MAY MEET KIND OF INDIVIDUALLY IN THIS CAMPING AREA
AND THEN UH TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK THERE WILL BE TWO SPECIFIC DAYS WHEN WE HONOR THESE TWO UH
UH GROUPS MY THE GRANDFATHERS AND THE GREAT GRANDFATHERS
UH SO IT'S KIND OF ONCE MORE COMBINING THE WHOLE GROUP AGAIN
BUT UH IT'S IT'S IT'S UH IT REQUIRES A LOT OF UH LOGISTICS FOR FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE TO MEET
AND A LOT OF UH ARRANGING FOR ACTIVITIES
UH
WELL UH COURSE YOU WANT TO DO SOME KINDS OF THINGS THAT WHICH WILL HELP THEM TO GET TO KNOW THE ANCESTOR THAT YOU'RE HONORING
BUT BESIDES THAT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN AND AND DIFFERENT AGES YOU NEED TO TRY TO FIND THINGS
THAT UH THAT THEY WILL JUST HA- LIKE TO DO TOGETHER SO THAT THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY SAYS REUNION THEY WON'T RUN LIKE
THE FOUR WINDS
SO IT HAS TO BE PRETTY FUN TOO I THINK UH WE'RE WE'RE GOING UH GOING TO UTAH TO UH UH PLACE NEAR PARK CITY
AND UH AND IT'S A A PRETTY GOOD SIZE AREA WHERE THERE'LL BE HIKING AND AND THEN THERE WILL BE UH
OH JUST UH GENERAL KINDS OF THINGS LIKE UH SWIMMING AND WHATEVER DURING THE UH IN THE AREA ROUNDABOUT WHICH THEY WILL DO DURING THE DAYS WHEN THEY WANT TO
WHEN THEY'RE NOT UH UH REHEARSING OR WHATEVER FOR A PART OF THE THE PLAY AND THEN WE'LL KIND OF GET TOGETHER AND AND UH WORK OUT SOME SMALL
OH VIGNETTES OR OR UH ACTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT MUSICAL NUMBERS
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE TOGETHER EARLY DURING THE WEEK WILL HELP US TO GET TOGETHER TO PREPARE THOSE THINGS FOR THE FOR THE PROGRAMS AT THE END OF THE WEEK
SO IT IT WE'RE REAL EXCITED ABOUT IT NOW ALWAYS BEFORE WE HAVE ONLY HAD MY GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY AND UH
WE ONLY DID IT FOR ONE DAY
AND UH THE LAST TIME WE D- WE WERE DOING IT EVERY TWO YEARS AND WE DECIDED LAST TIME WE WOULD WAIT A THIRD YEAR BECAUSE IT CAME ACROSS SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO GET THERE AND UH
SOME PEOPLE COME FROM BACK EAST AND COURSE I COME FROM TEXAS SO THERE'S SOME OF US COME FROM QUITE A WAYS
UH AND SO WE WE HAD A LITTLE LONGER AND DECIDED TO TRY TO HOLD IT
UH IN A SITUATION THAT WAS A LITTLE LONGER LIKE A CAMPING SITUATION SOMETHING THAT WASN'T TOO EXPENSIVE BUT
UH COULD BE MORE OF A VACATION SITUATION FOR FAMILIES TO COME AND PARTICIPATE IN WHILE GETTING TO KNOW THEIR ANCESTORS AND RELATIVES
UH SO THAT MAYBE THEY'D BE ATTRACTED MORE TO BRING THEIR FAMILIES
NOW I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ALL MY FAMILY TO COME BEFORE BUT THIS YEAR I HAVE UH SEVERAL MARRIED DAUGHTERS AND AND SONS WHOSE FAMILIES ARE COMING EN MASSE SO IT IT IT LOOKS TO BE A LOT MORE INTERESTING ACTIVITY
WELL UH THE ANCESTORS CAME FROM THERE
AND UH AND WE WE WERE HOLDING THEM THERE BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME LIVING ANCESTORS UP UNTIL
UH FAIRLY RECENTLY AT THIS POINT IN THAT GENERATION THAT WE'RE HONORING
THERE'S ONLY WELL MY MOTHER IS NINETY THREE AND SHE WON'T GO THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO HARD ON HER
BUT UH AND THERE'S ONE OTHER WIFE BUT ALL OF THE ALL OF THE CHILDREN ARE NOW GONE THEY THEY'VE PASSED AWAY IN THE MEANTIME
AND SO UH AT THAT POINT WE WERE GOING FOR THAT REASON WE WERE GOING THERE
BUT IT JUST THERE JUST MORE OF THEM THERE STILL THAN THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THE REST OF US ARE KIND OF STRUNG AROUND SOME BUT WE- BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONVENIENT FOR THE BIGGEST MAJORITY IT STILL IS THERE
ALSO WE HAD A WE HAD A A THE MEMBER WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF IT IN GENERAL THIS TIME HAD SOME ACCESS TO THIS PARK WHICH WAS A BIG FACTOR
WHETHER WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT THERE AGAIN BUT THERE ARE OTHER KIND OF ARRANGEMENTS LIKE IN IN UH
IN SOME OF THE AREAS IN COLORADO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY SKI IN THE WINTER TIME YOU CAN MAKE SOME PRETTY GOOD ARRANGEMENTS FOR UH FOR GROUP UH ACTIVITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO WE MIGHT DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALSO SOMETIMES UNIVERSITIES WILL WILL RENT OUT UH AREAS FOR DOING THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT UH
WELL WE KNEW GENERALLY THE TIME OF YEAR UH THAT WE WANTED TO DO IT IN THREE YEARS AGO BUT WE COULD NOT SET THE DATE UNTIL THE FIRST OF JANUARY THIS YEAR BECAUSE THIS PARK WHERE THEY HAVE IT
UH THEY ALLOW PEOPLE IN THE VICINITY TO MAKE THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AHEAD OF TIME AND SO WE KIND OF HAD TO TAKE WHAT WAS LEFT
AND UH SO WE WE FEEL PRETTY FORTUNATE TO HAVE GOTTEN IN AT ALL BUT UH
UH I THINK YOU NEED TO PLAN ON YOU NEED TO BE SURE AND PLAN UH AT LEAST A YEAR AHEAD OF TIME OR YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE PEOPLE
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO PLAN THEIR VACATIONS THAT FAR AHEAD A LITTLE BIT
IF NOT EXACTLY AT LEAST KNOW GENERALLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO
WELL IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT TO TO KNOW QUITE A WHILE AHEAD OF TIME
UH THE LAST TIME WE HAD ONE UH I WAS IN CHARGE OF IT AND MY GOAL WAS TO WRITE A HISTORY OF MY
OF MY FATHER AND HIS  BROTHERS AND SISTERS
THERE WAS A HISTORY OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BUT THERE WAS NO HISTORY ON THEM SO I SPENT THE TWO YEARS BEFORE THAT COMPILING AND AND WRITING THE HISTORY AND THEN WE GAVE IT OUT AT THAT
THIS YEAR WE'RE NOT WE'RE WE'RE COMBINING IT IN THE AND THE PARENTS BEFORE AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME UM
UH ACTING OUT OF OF THESE GROUPS AND TRY TO HELP THEM GET BETTER ACQUAINTED AND MOSTLY IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING SO WE'RE WE'RE JUST KIND OF PLAYING IT BY EAR AND SEEING HOW IT GOES I THINK
BUT

GIVE THEM A CHANCE YOU KNOW WITH A POSITIVE HAVE THEM SIT DOWN WITH THEIR BOSS AND THEIR BOSS'S BOSS AND UH YOU KNOW JUST TALK WITH THEM ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
PO- THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT UH
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE SOMEBODY A BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BECAUSE EVERYBODY WOULD PROBABLY SAY OH WELL THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW I JUST TRIED IT ONCE TO SEE WHAT IT'D BE LIKE
YEAH SO YOU PRETTY MUCH GOT TO GIVE EVERYBODY ONE SHOT
AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO
AND AND IF THEY ADMIT TO HAVING A PROBLEM OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW I WOULD HELP THEM OUT AS AS LONG AS THEY WANTED HELP AND WOULD STAY IN THE PROGRAM I'D YOU KNOW HELP THEM OUT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
WHAT IF ALONG A SIMILAR TOPIC STRAYING FROM THE DRUG THING WHAT ABOUT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT AIDS TESTING FOR
UH SAY YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN AND UH A PATIENT COMES IN AND WANTS TREATED SHOULD YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TEST THEM FOR AIDS
YEAH
IN ADVANCED CASES YES
RIGHT
SEE THAT'S A QUESTION I'M WONDERING BECAUSE I'M PURSUING A CAREER IN MEDICINE
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE DECIDING THAT IN THE COURTS YOU KNOW AS I'M CONTINUING MY EDUCATION
SO IT W- YOU KNOW BY THE TIME I GET OUT AND BEGIN PRACTICING THEN
I DON'T KNOW YOU YOU KN- OR COULD BE EITHER WAY I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO KNOW IF THESE PEOPLE HAVE AIDS I MEAN I'M THE
BUT
AND
THAT'S
IT'S SUCH A TOUGH ISSUE I- I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT TO YOU TO MAKE THE CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE SINCE WE BOTH AGREE IT'S KIND OF HARD TO
YEAH
HUH
YEAH
UH YOU WORK FOR TI
OH OH
UH
IS THAT HOW YOU GOT ON THE
PHONE PROGRAM
MY WIFE WORKS FOR TI YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT

THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
WELL THAT'S GOOD
YEAH GOOD
HUH
WOW
WELL THAT'S GOOD
WELL NANCY IT'S BEEN GOOD TALKING TO YOU
WELL THANK YOU AND UH I GUESS I'LL BRACE MYSELF FOR A HEAVY STORM COMING MY WAY
ALL RIGHTY
BYE
I'M ALL FOR IT
BECAUSE I- I THINK IF YOU DON'T DO IT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IT
AND I DON'T DO DRUGS SO I NEVER WORRY ABOUT IT AND I- I THINK IT'S A I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA I- I EVEN THINK THE RANDOM IS FINE YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND THAT'S  IN A NUTSHELL AND I THINK YOU KNOW I SAY IF YOU IF YOU DON'T DO IT YOU R- REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT
WELL I Y- JUST UH LIKE I SAY I JUST THINK IT'S A A FINE IDEA AND I THE COMPANIES THAT I'VE HEARD THAT HAD A RANDOM TESTING I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA UH WHERE I WORK THEY DON'T
DO RANDOM TESTING AND UH NOW WHEN I HIRED IN I HAD TO HAVE A UH
A DRUG TEST WHICH WAS FINE WITH ME I- I WASN'T WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT THAT  BUT AND THEN I THINK THAT'S PERFECTLY I DON'T THINK IT'S INFRINGING ON YOUR RIGHTS OR I THINK THE COMPANY HAS A RIGHT TO HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE DRUG FREE
WELL
I GUESS I'D GIVE THEM
I'D GIVE THEM ONE CHANCE MAYBE I- I DON'T KNOW PERSON I'D F- IF IT WAS MY COMPANY I'D FIRE THEM RIGHT THEN BUT N- YOU KNOW IN TODAY'S SOCIETY YOU CAN'T DO THAT YEAH I GUESS YOU GUESS HAVE TO GIVE THEM A A WARNING AND THEN THEN THE SECOND TIME THEY'D BE TERMINATED
IF THEY TESTED POSITIVE
AND I REALLY WOULD WATCH THEM AFTER THAT BUT UH
I'D PROBABLY SEND THEM ON A EAT PROGRAM YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM I'D I'D MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THAT
AND UH THE FIRST TIME THEY'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE EAT PROGRAM
AND I THINK MOST COMPANIES HAVE THOSE  NOW I THINK THEY HAVE IT MUST BE A LAW OR SOMETHING BECAUSE AWFUL LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE THEM
AND I'D MAKE THEM DO THAT
AND IF THEY REFUSED TO DO THAT THEN THEY'D BE FIRED
WAY I'D DO IT WHAT WOULD YOU DO
YEAH
OR MAYBE IT'S A MY ANTIHISTAMINE I WAS ON THAT  YOU KNOW TESTED POSITIVE I- I DON'T DO IT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW IF THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT
SECOND CH- YEAH YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT IF THEY FLAT REFUSED YOU KNOW AND SAID NO I WON'T THEN I'D SAY WELL THEN I'M SORRY THEN YOU CAN'T SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE DRUGGIES IN OUR PAYROLL THE WAY I'D LOOK AT IT
FORTUNATELY I'VE NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SINCE I- I HAVE NEVER EVEN
TRIED UH A PUFF OR WHATEVER IT UH YOU KNOW AND IF SOMEBODY GAVE ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SAID NANCY GO BY SOME DO- I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO GO BUY IT I'M SURE YOU CAN AT ANY HIGH SCHOOL OR ANY STREET CORNER THEY TELL ME BUT I DON'T KNOW
UH
I GUESS IF HE SUSPECTED SURE I W- BECAUSE IF I WAS A PHYSICIAN I WOULDN'T WANT TO
TEST THEM I MEAN I WOULDN'T WANT TO TREAT THEM FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD YOU KNOW I I'D GET THAT BUT
I THINK IF IF YOU SUSPECT IT AND I'M SURE A DOCTOR CAN LOOK AT SOMEBODY AND SUSPECT DON'T YOU THINK BY LOOKING AT THEM
YEAH NOT PROBABLY NOT AT THE FIRST I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT OR NOT
I N- HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF THAT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YOU'RE RIGHT
OH I WOULD TOO ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY I JUST DON'T UH
AND I WOULD IF I WERE A DOCTOR I WOULDN'T
I- I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING WRONG FOR A DOCTOR TO REFUSE TO I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TO TREAT A PATIENT WITH AIDS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW WHY TAKE A CHANCE LIKE THAT DOCTOR IN NEW YORK THAT GOT INFECTED FROM A PATIENT AND YOU KNOW SHE ENDED UP I THINK
SHE DIED I DON'T REMEMBER IF SHE DIED OR NOT BUT SHE'S SUING THAT HOSPITAL BECAUSE
UH SHE WAS WORKING WITH UH WITH A AIDS PATIENT THAT GOT THEM
SO I- I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK I WOULD UH
TREAT ONE
YOU'RE
ISN'T THAT TOTALLY BORING
OH ME WELL UH NO I LIKE I SAY I'VE ONLY BEEN TESTED THE ONE TIME WHEN I HIRED IN UH I HAD WAS TESTED FOR DRUGS
AND OF COURSE THEY DO EVERYBODY YOU CAN'T WORK WHERE I WORK UNLESS YOU'RE TESTED FOR IT AND SO THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS FINE WITH ME BUT THEY MAKE YOU DO ALL THE SEALING YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING YOURSELF THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SEAL THEM OR
TAG THEM OR ANYTHING YOU YOU DO IT ALL YOURSELF THEY TELL YOU WHAT TO DO BUT YOU DO IT ALL YOURSELF
SO IF THERE'S A MISTAKE IT'S YOUR MISTAKE I GUESS
I DON'T KNOW
NO I DID YEARS AGO FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I WORKED UH IN FORT WORTH AT A A LANDING GEAR COMPANY MENASCO
AND UH LOVE IT JUST LOVE IT I WISH I'D FOUND THIS COMPANY TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT
SO I STARTED OUT AT TI YEARS AGO MY DAUGHTER WORKS AT TI
YEAH BECAUSE SHE WAS ON IT AND SHE HOW DID YOU GET ON IT
OH DOES SHE
YEAH I LIKED TI I LOVED IT I QU- QUIT BACK IN EIGHTY FIVE UH AND WENT WITH MARTIN MARIETTA DOWN IN ORLANDO
AND JUST HATED OR- ORLANDO JUST OH YEAH JUST HATED IT COULDN'T WAIT TO GET BACK AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT ALMOST FOUR YEARS TO GET BACK BUT I MADE IT
AND  BUT I'VE ALMOST DOUBLED MY SALARY SINCE LEAVING TI NOW THAT'S HOW BAD TI PAYS I HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED MY SALARY I REALLY HAVE AND I
UH BUT I LOVE TI I R- I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING THERE AND UH
BUT YOU KNOW IT WASN'T TO BE ANYMORE
HAD TO MOVE ON
BUT UH YEAH TH- YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY DO THE RANDOM TESTING AT TI
AND I- I- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT
IF YOU KNOW IF THEY I DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DO IT ON SUSPICION THEY C- THEY CAN JUST DO IT AND UH
AND THEY DO IT QUITE OFTEN I UNDERSTAND
AND I DON'T BLAME THEM AT ALL I MEAN
THEIR COMPANY AND
YOU'RE A DANGER TO PEOPLE IF YOU'RE ON DRUGS AND I THINK YOU'RE A DANGER TO TO PEOPLE THAT YOU WORK WITH AND THEN THEY HAVE TOO MUCH SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT OUT THERE TO HAVE SOMEBODY OUT YOU KNOW DOPED UP WORKING AROUND IT I THINK
SO UH
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY EVEN IF EVEN IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY OFF YOU KNOW AWAY FROM WORK USING DRUGS
THAT YOU CAN COME BACK AND AND RAT ON THEM AND THEY'LL GET THEM THAT WAY
IF YOU SEE THEM AT A PARTY TO YOU KNOW DOING DOPE YOU CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND TELL ON THEM
IS WHAT I'VE UN- I'VE HEARD
YEAH IT IS THEY'RE THEY'RE CRACKING DOWN ON THEM BUT UH THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET TOUGH ON THESE GUYS YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW AND THEY
TAKE THEM TO COURT AND THEN THEY JUST SLAP THEM ON THE HAND AND LET THEM THE DEALERS OUT AND YOU KNOW I JUST MAKES ME SICK I  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH CRIME I KNOW IT'S BECAUSE OF DOPE
I KNOW WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP YOU COULD SLEEP WITH YOUR WINDOWS OPEN WELL EVEN MY KIDS WERE GROWING UP WE DIDN'T LOCK OUR HOUSE AT NIGHT WE JUST WENT TO BED YOU KNOW AND LEFT THE DOORS OPEN THE WINDOWS OPEN YOU COULD W- TAKE WALKS AT NIGHT YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE
AND I THINK MOST OF IT'S DRUG RELATED MOST OF THE CRIME THAT WE HAVE IS DRUG RELATED
AND UH I- I DON'T I DON'T THINK MY CHILDREN HAVE EVER
IF THEY DID I DIDN'T KNOW IT
BUT I KNOW THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ON IT IF THEY EVER TRIED IT I DIDN'T KNOW IT AND BECAUSE MY SON WAS A
ATHLETE AND ATHLETES NORMALLY CAN'T
DON'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO STAY IN SHAPE MY DAUGHT-  MY DAUGHTER JUST WASN'T THE TYPE SHE JUST DIDN'T CARE FOR STUFF LIKE THAT AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM SMOKED CIGARETTES EITHER SO THAT'S THAT'S
YEAH I REALLY IS I DID WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP AND I TH- THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T BECAUSE I DID AND I QUIT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
AND THE SMARTEST THING I EVER DID
TOOK SHOTS FROM A DOCTOR IN RICHARDSON
AND HAVEN'T HAD A PUFF SINCE
SHE GAVE SHOTS IN THE NOSE AND IN THE EARS AND IN THE ARM SIX SHOTS AND THAT'S IT NEVER SMOKED AGAIN
SO
YEAH I'M REAL PROUD OF MYSELF
GOOD NICE TALKING TO YOU IF I CAN WILL UM GOOD LUCK ON IT
OH YOU YOU PLEASE DO
TALK TO YOU BYE-BYE
OKAY
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA
ALL KINDS OF LITTLE
LIKE I SAID IT'S GOOD THAT THAT IF YOU VISIT AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE COLLEGES BEFORE THEY EVEN YOU KNOW GO TO ATTEND GO DOWN THERE AND VISIT FOR THE WEEKEND THEY DO HAVE THOSE PROGRAMS WHERE YOU CAN GO DOWN THERE
UH WELL NO UH ACTUALLY UH MY MY DAUGHTER IS QUITE YOUNG YET BUT UH I WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL UH AND I FIND THAT OVERALL THEY'RE PROBABLY MUCH CHEAPER
AND THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION'S PROBABLY I WOULD SAY IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'D YOU GET AT YOU KNOW MOST OF YOUR LIKE A&M TEXAS AND UH YOU KNOW VANDERBILT SOME OF THOSE
I THINK THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCE BUT PROBABLY IN SIZE IN IN IN CAPACITY OF CLASSES AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT ALL IN ALL THE EDUCATION LEVEL PROBABLY JUST AS GOOD IF YOU IF YOU PARTICIPATE
YEAH
YEAH WELL I TELL YOU WHAT IT IT'S EXPENSIVE OF COURSE I WORKED MY WAY THROUGH AND UH I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA IN SOME CASES EXCEPT THAT NOW A DAYS IT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE
WELL YEAH IT IT IT IT CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE REAL QUICK YOU KNOW I I WANNA BE ABLE TO AT LEAST I WANNA PAY MY PAY THE TUITION
YOU KNOW GIVE HER TRANSPORTATION IF IT'S NECESSARY AND COURSE I'D LIKE HER TO LIVE IN THE DORM IF IT'S POSSIBLE
BUT I DON'T WANT HER TO HAVE TO WORK I I WOULD I WOULD I DON'T MIND IF SHE HAS A LITTLE PART TIME JOB TO EARN JUST A LITTLE EXTRA SPENDING MONEY THAT SORT OF THING
AND SUMMER WORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT UNLESS SHE JUST TENDS TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH BUT UH I DON'T WANT TO TO HAVE HER TO FEEL FINANCIALLY YOU KNOW BURDENED UH AND NOT YOU KNOW CONCENTRATE ON STUDYING AND THAT SORT OF THING
BUT UH I KNOW LIKE
I GUESS PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I'VE I'VE LEARNED IS THAT TO TRY AND PICK A COLLEGE WHERE THEY HAVE AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT DEGREE PLANS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE AS AN ALTERNATIVE YOU START ONE YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THAT ONE
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO CHANGE COLLEGES THEN YOU LOSE HOURS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT UH PRELIMINARY UH APPLICATIONS  YEAH YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL GO TO A COLLEGE WHEN THEY GET THERE THEY FIND OUT GOSH I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL
AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE THAT THEY WANT OTHER THAN THAT SO THEY ARE FACED WITH HAVING TO DO ALL THAT AND THAT CAN THAT CAN THROW AS MUCH AS A YEAR OUT OF YOUR DEGREE PLAN
BUT UH THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I THAT I ENCOUNTERED UH SO I I KNOW  YEAH SO AND THEN ALSO THE OTHER THING IS GOING TO A J- TO THE JUNIOR COLLEGE
FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS TO GET ALL YOU PRELIMINARY COURSES YOUR MATH YOUR ENGLISH HISTORY GOVERNMENT ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT ARE TIME CONSUMING UH AND SOME OF THE COURSE THAT YOU CAN TAKE ON TELEVISION
AND GET THOSE OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE YOU EVEN START A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE COURSE ESPECIALLY ENGLISH AND HISTORY
WELL LESS EXPENSIVE BUT NOT ONLY THAT BUT A LOT OF THOSE COURSE THEY THERE'RE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF YOU'RE STARTING OUT IN A FOUR YEAR DEGREE PLAN AT A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE
THEY'RE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND THEY GO A LITTLE FASTER AND AND IN JUNIOR COLLEGE THEY GO A LITTLE SLOWER AND YOU DO LEARN YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE SELF PACED AND UH
YEAH
WELL I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO GET AWAY YOU KNOW  NOT NECESSARILY SO FAR THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO THEM BUT AT LEAST
YOU KNOW A HUNDRED MILES OR OR EVEN TWO HUNDRED MILES WHERE YOU CAN AT LEAST GO DOWN THERE ON A ON A LIKE A MONTH A ONE MONTH BASIS OR THEY CAN COME HOME
YOU KNOW AND IT'S NOT REAL EXPENSIVE UH YOU KNOW UH LOT OF TIMES THEY CAN SHARE RIDES COMING BACK AND FORTH IF THEY YOU KNOW HAVE PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL AREA THAT LIVE NEAR THEM BUT UH
YEAH
YOU KNOW NONE OF DID THAT WE ALL STAYED RIGHT CLOSE TO HOME AND OF COURSE I WAS MARRIED THE WHOLE TIME I WAS IN SCHOOL BUT UH BUT IT WAS UH IT WAS STILL ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE MOM AND DAD WERE STILL AROUND IF YOU NEEDED THEM AND UH
YOU KNOW NOT THAT I COULD REALLY DEPEND ON THEM MUCH BUT THEY WERE STILL THERE AND YOU'RE NOT FAR ENOUGH
UH-HUH
I KNOW I GUESS PROBABLY ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I NOTICE IS THAT SOME OF THE COLLEGES ARE VERY MUCH
UH ENCOURAGING YOU KNOW THE KIDS TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL THE FRATERNITIES SORORITIES AND ALL THE EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
MUCH SO BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE MONEY MAKING THINGS AND THEY DO SUPPORT THEY DO HELP SUPPORT THE SCHOOL
BUT I PREFER COLLEGES THAT DON'T STRESS THAT AS THE MAJOR FOCUS
UH I I'D RATHER THEM GO TO THE SCHOOLS THAT FOCUS ON THE ON THE ACADEMIC PART OF IT
AND THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A KEY NOW A DAYS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE COLLEGE PROMOTE THE PARTYING AND THE AND THE SORORITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND ONCE YOU GET HOOKED YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY GET UH LOCKED UP IN THAT STUFF AND YOUR GRADES SUFFER
THEY REALLY DO UH I GOT WRAPPED UP IN THAT OF COURSE I WAS IN YOU KNOW ATHLETICS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IT GOT SO TIME CONSUMING IT GOT TO BE TO WHERE
I HAD TO DECIDE EITHER I WAS GONNA JUST QUIT ALL THAT MESS AND GO STUDY OR OR OR YOU KNOW JUST BASICALLY SKIN THROUGH
UH WELL I QUIT I QUIT FOOT- I QUIT FOOTBALL BECAUSE I JUST UH FIGURED THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THIS AFTER I GET OUT I'M NOT GONNA GO PRO FOOTBALL
UH I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH I FACED THE YOU KNOW FACED THAT UP FRONT AND SAY YOU KNOW I'D RATHER GET MY GRADES
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID I QUIT AND WENT AFTER AFTER THE GRADES
NO NOT AT ALL  SO IT
UH BUT
BUT YOU KNOW YOU A LOT OF KIDS GET HURT AND THEN THEY THEY WHEN THEY CAN'T PLAY PRO BALL ANYWAY AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE EDUCATION THEY SHOULD HAVE WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO
AND THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG THING RIGHT NOW THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE ATHLETICS THE A LOT OF THEM ARE PLAYING BEFORE THEY EVEN CAN FINISH COLLEGE
THEY'RE PLAYING PRO BALL I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE BE A PREREQUISITE THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A DEGREE WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GRADE POINT AVERAGE BEFORE THEY ARE EVEN ELIGIBLE FOR PRO BALL
BUT THEY DON'T THEY WONT DO THAT
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL I KNOW I- IT'S GETTING DOWN TO
IT'S GETTING DOWN TO GRADE SCHOOL NOW I THINK THEY REALLY NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU KNOW FROM STRESSING THE ATHLETICS AND EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND GET EVEN AT THE YOUNG AGE GET
GET THE POLITICS AND THE MONEY OUT OF THE ATHLETICS
AND START GETTING BACK IN THE SCHOOL
UH-HUH
MY DAUGHTER THIS WEEK UH
AS PART OF A UH IN HER HIGH SCHOOL HU- HUMANITIES COURSE SHE HAS BEEN TAKING A LITTLE SUB COURSE THAT WAS OFFERED WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WRITE OFF YOU KNOW AND REQUEST THEIR UM
PREFERRED COLLEGE THEY HAD TO WRITE TO A MINIMUM OF
THREE PREFERABLY FIVE
AND I THINK SHE DID FOUR AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD TYPED LITTLE LETTERS REQUESTING YOU KNOW CATALOGS AND WHAT NOT AND FIGURE UP MILEAGE EXPENSES AND
TRIPS HOME AND
THEY HAD TO FIGURE ONE AIRLINE
UH TRIP HOME AND AT LEAST ONE CAR TRIP HOME
PER YEAR AND GOSH YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
HAVE YOUR KIDS GONE TO STATE SCHOOLS
UH-HUH UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH UH-HUH UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
MY FOLKS KIND OF HAD A AN UNWRITTEN RULE THERE WERE NINE OF US AND
WE ALL JUST WORKED REAL HARD TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE  WE DID BUT IF WE WENT TO STATE SCHOOLS
WE GOT VIRTUALLY NO HELP IF WE WENT OUT OF STATE WE GOT A LOT MORE HELP FROM THEM UM AND KIND OF THE PREMISE BEING THAT UM IF YOU
YOU KNOW PART OF COLLEGE IS BEING FAR ENOUGH WAY THAT YOU CAN'T COME HOME AND DO YOU LAUNDRY AND COME HOME FOR ALL FOOTBALL GAMES AND
THAT KIND OF THING SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WAS SOME OF THE FOCUS ALTHOUGH
I THINK THEY RELAXED THAT I WAS ONE OF THE OLDER ONES BECAUSE IT GOT MORE EXPENSIVE THEY YOU KNOW ITS SOME
ITS JUST SO EXPENSIVE AND YOU KNOW THIS LITTLE EXERCISE WE DID THIS WEEK WITH OUT DAUGHTER WE JUST CRINGED IT JUST
OH YOU KNOW THE CHANCES OF HER BEING ABLE TO GO HER FATHER'S AND I ALMA MATER ARE PRETTY SLIM I'M AFRAID YOU KNOW IT UH
AND
UH-HUH
I JUST REALLY BELIEVE IN DORMS FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST YEAR DEPENDING ON THE CHILD BUT YOU KNOW I
AND OF COURSE SUMMER WORK AND
YEAH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
AND THAT'S OKAY
OH AND SOME A LOT OF THINGS JUST DON'T SWITCH THEY JUST DON'T SWITCH
YEAH
THAT'S REALLY A VERY VIABLE SUGGESTION I HAVEN'T EVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT ALTHOUGH AS YOU OUTLINED IT CERTAINLY MAKES PERFECT SENSE IT JUST
YOU KNOW FROM  FROM EXPERIENCE WELL IT'S
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND
UH-HUH UH-HUH
WELL THE UH COLLEN COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT WE HAVE OUT HERE IS JUST GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS WE HAVE BEEN SO IMPRESSED WITH IT AND UH YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SOME THE CONTINUING EDUCATION
UH PROGRAMS THROUGH IT AND AS A FAMILY WE'VE YOU KNOW BEEN INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THE ARTS THINGS AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S PROVIDED
I'VE BEEN REALLY  I MEAN THEY'LL NEVER GOING TO BE ON THEIR OWN HOW LONG AM I GONNA YOU KNOW HAVE KIDS IN MY HOUSE
STAYING UP TILL YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE IN THE MORNING
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH YEAH THAT'S
WELL AND YOU KNOW I THINK IF THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T GET HOME ALL THE TIME THEN THEY THEY'RE MORE BRAVE THEY KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FORGE SOME NEW RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU KNOW BE
ABLE TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND
THEY DON'T JUST HOLD ON TO THE OLD HOBBIES AND OLD THE OLD ACTIVITIES THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE ADVENTUROUS YOU KNOW AND
THOUGHTFUL UH-HUH
SO THAT
YEAH YEAH
YOU IT'S NICE TO KNOW WELL WE ALWAYS WERE
WE HAD A LOT OF FAMILY IN THE AREA EXTENDED FAMILY MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH UH UH WENT TO A CHURCH SCHOOL AND WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR FAMILIES THERE BUT WE HAD EXTENDED FAMILIES
AND UM UM
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH ME TOO
AND YOUR GRADES REALLY SUFFER
UM UH-HUH
AND AT THAT POINT DID YOU ALMOST SAY GEE I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS SCHOOL  TO DO THAT
HAVE YOU BEEN SORRY
OUR TEXAS SCHOOL SYSTEM SO REALLY
YEP MY UH
YEP
YEP I AGREE BECAUSE
I WAS JUST READING A THING IN THE UH THIS IS OFF SUBJECT SOME WHAT BUT IN THE READER'S DIGEST ABOUT UH
ATH- PRO ATHLETES AND THAT UH
THAT GOTTEN ON TO DRUGS YOU KNOW AND INVARIABLY IT WAS ONES THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO
YOU KNOW SOME WAY OR ANOTHER TO FINISH AND REALIZE THAT THERE WAS ANY OTHER MONEY ANYWHERE EXCEPT YOU KNOW IN DEALING DRUGS BUT INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE ATHLETIC ABILITIES AND
WELL  A THING THAT WE HAD HERE JUST RECENTLY
AND I I REALLY I FORGOT TO CUT THE ARTICLE OUT I WAS MAD AT MYSELF THAT I DIDN'T BECAUSE I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON IT
BUT THERE WAS MAN HERE IN THE PLANO SCHOOL SYSTEM WHO HAD
WHO HAS THE PREMISE THAT OUR GRADES IN THE METROPLEX IN IN YOU KNOW
SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW IRVING AND AND UH RICHARDSON LAKE HIGHLANDS AND PLANO I THINK WERE HIS TARGET ONES ARE INFLATED ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED GRADES
AND HE FELT LIKE THOSE KIDS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GOT IN TO COLLEGE SITUATIONS WERE NOT UM
THE BASIC QUESTION IS TOO MUCH
AND
I DON'T KNOW MY MY OPINION I GUESS HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA THEY ANNOUNCED THAT MAY SECOND WAS THE UH TAX DAY THAT'S WHEN YOU EVERYTHING YOU'VE EARNED SO FAR HAS GONE TO TAXES
THE REST OF THE YEAR IS YOURS
THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF YOUR INCOME
AND I DON'T KNOW UH WHO CAME UP WITH THAT FIGURE BUT I THINK IT REALLY COMES OUT TO BE MORE THAN THE THIRD
BUT UH I I DON'T KNOW I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION SORT OF LIKE SELECTIVE
APPROVAL ALMOST LIKE THE UNITED WAY CAMPAIGN WHERE YOU AGREE WITH MOST OF THE AGENCIES BUT UH DON'T AGREE WITH SOME OF THEM
AND
I THINK THAT WE COULD HAVE LESS TAX
BY CUTTING OUT SOME OF THE
THE UH
PROGRAMS THAT WE SUPPORT
BUT OVERALL I GUESS WE'RE PRETTY FORTUNATE NATURE NATION AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT WE HAVE TO PAY HOW DO YOU FEEL
YEAH I'VE DONE SOME BUSINESS OVERSEAS IN IN LATIN AMERICA AND OF COURSE KNOW ABOUT THE WE HEAR ABOUT SWEDEN WITH THEIR
UH SOCIAL PROGRAM BUT YOU DON'T HEAR WHAT THE COST IS SAME IN EUR- IN BRITAIN AND OTHER NATIONS MUCH HIGHER TAX RATES
BUT THE
OH YES
OH YES THAT THAT'S THE UH THE TYPE OF THING THAT REALLY IRRITATES ME WHERE THEY CAN GET SIGNIFICANT INCREASES WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS FACING LAYOFFS OR OR CUTBACKS OR
UH EQUATING IT TO A PERSONAL INCOME SITUATION
AND YET IT'S ALMOST AUTOMATIC OR IT'S HIDDEN AND
UH I THINK THEY NEED TO BITE THE SAME BULLET THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS DO
THE ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE RECENTLY IS
CENTERED ON SUCH THINGS AS THE TRIP BY DAN QUAYLE TO AUGUSTA GEORGIA TO PLAY GOLF
AND I REALIZE THAT CONSTANT COMMUNICATION IS NECESSARY
ESPECIALLY WHEN BUSH HAD HIS UH
HEART RHYTHM PROBLEM THIS WEEKEND BUT
WE CAN ALWAYS SEND JETS FOR SOMEONE I THINK IF IF THEY'RE OUT OF POCKET
RATHER THAN ACCEPTING IT AS THE NORM FOR A NICE GOLFING TRIP
SO THAT'S WHAT I MEANT ABOUT THE SELECTIVES SOME THINGS I THINK WE'RE DOING EXTREMELY WRONG COULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY
BUT OTHER THINGS UH
LIKE I ENJOY SEEING MONEY SPENT ON THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE NICEST NATIONAL TREASURES AND I LOVE TO SEE
KIDS OF UH ANY BACKGROUND ROAMING THROUGH AND SEEING SUCH GREAT COLLECTIONS
BUT
THEN WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE FOREIGN AID THAT WE GIVE AWAY
THAT BOTHERS ME A LOT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THOUGH WHEN AS YOU SAID THE UH BUREAUCRACY GETS OUT OF HAND REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU VOTE FOR
THE BUREAUCRACY CONTINUES TOO
UH-HUH
OH I THINK IT'S WAY
IT'S WAY OUT OF HAND I'M ALMOST TURNING INTO AN ISOLATIONIST
WHICH IS NOT NOT A GOOD ATTITUDE IN IN GLOBAL UH COMMUNICATIONS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE THIS THESE DAYS BUT IT'S A MATTER OF UH
I HATE TO SEE MONEY THROWN AWAY AND THAT'S WHAT I RE- I EQUATE TO SOME OF OUR FOREIGN AID POLICIES
AND THEY
I AGREE I THINK THAT'S
I HAVE SOME PROBLEM WITH SOCIAL PROGRAMS AT HOME IN TERMS OF MAKING IT TOO CONVENIENT TO BE ON ON WELFARE
OH YEAH YEAH I I THINK WHEN YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL TO STAY ON WELFARE THAN IT IS TO GET A JOB YOU'VE GOT A BASIC CONCEPT PROBLEM
YEAH
BUT I I THINK UH IF WE'RE GOING TO WASTE MONEY I'D ALMOST SEE RATHER SEE US WASTE IT AT HOME
THAN OVERSEAS TOO AND THAT THERE'S SOME UNUSUAL
THINGS WHICH CAN OCCUR IN THE FOREIGN AID UH
BY A STROKE OF A PEN I THINK OUR PRESIDENT CAN FORGIVE FOREIGN DEBT AND THAT'S A LOT OF POWER VESTED IN ONE
ONE PERSON IN OUR SYSTEM OF UH
GOVERNANCE
AND I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND YOU AND I ARE PAYING FOR IT
BUT JIM IT COMES BACK A LOT TO THE SAME THING THAT YOU SAID INITIALLY YOU'VE BEEN OVERSEAS AND HAVE SEEN
OTHER PLACES
AND I GUESS WE'RE STILL FORTUNATE BUT I THINK WE'RE JU- I JUST WANT US TO BE SMARTER
THAN WE ARE
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL YOUR YOUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH OKLAHOMA JUST VOTED FOR STATE LEGISLATORS UH ONE TERM
NO LET'S SEE
I FORGET WAS IT ONE TERM OR TWO TERM
FIXED
UH INCUMBENCY IN OTHER WORDS THEY CAN'T BE REEL- REELECTED AFTER
I THINK MAYBE THE SECOND TERM
FEDERAL
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT TAKES AWAY THE ISSUE OF OF A LOT OF THE UH SPECIAL LOBBYIST GROUPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
CREATING THE INCUMBENT UH
ABOUT
INVINCIB- INVINCIBILITY
BUT
THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THAT I'D WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD ONES AND I HATE TO SEE THEM LEAVE
BUT IT I GUESS IT'S HARD TO TO REALLY UH
IDENTIFY WHICH ARE THE GOOD AND WHICH ARE THE BAD
THE ELECTORATE SEEMS TO BE PUTTING THEM ALL BACK IN
AND I THOUGHT THIS LAST ELECTION WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT IT IT TURNED OUT IT REALLY WASN'T
UH-HUH
UH IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE NON ELECTED BUREAUC- BUREAUCRATS EITHER THAT'S
THAT'S AN ISSUE I THINK THAT REALLY FITS INTO IT BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SIT
IN THE SAME POSITION AND REALLY DON'T GIVE A HOOT WHO GETS ELECTED
THEY STILL KIND OF RUN THE SHOW AND AND SETUP ALL THE ROADBLOCKS AND THE
THE UH
HORRENDOUS REGULATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
BUT IT'S UH
IT'S OUR SYSTEM I THINK NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REALLY MANAGE IT WELL
UH-HUH UH-HUH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
WELL
YEAH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE GET UH
FROM CONGRESS THAT THAT AFFECTS US AS FAR AS THE UH
KNOWLEDGE TO TO ELECT THE RIGHT PEOPLE
I HAVE I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM FEDERAL REGISTER FOR INSTANCE
UH YOU CAN HAVE ALMOST PUT ANYTHING IN THERE YOU WANT TO
NO IT'S NOT IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER WHAT'S THE UH THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
UH SOMEONE CAN PUT IN INFORMATION RETROACTIVELY TO THAT TO SHOW THAT THEY SUPPORTED SOMETHING OR UH
YEAH IT
AND
WELL I I'VE LIVED OVERSEAS YOU KNOW IT'S WITH IN THE ARMY AND I SEE WHAT KIND OF TAXES THEY PAY IN OTHER COUNTRIES
IT JUST SEEMS AS IF
FROM THE TIME I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING POLITICS WHICH WAS I GUESS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE REALLY GOT INTERESTED IN POLITICS AND KEEPING UP WITH IT
IT JUST SEEMS SINCE THAT TIME THE BUREAUCRATIC MACHINE HAS JUST GOTTEN SO OUT OF CONTROL
AND THEN THEY SCREAM ABOUT THAT
THAT OR THE UH POLITICIANS SCREAM ABOUT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND NOT RAISE TAXES BUT THEY VOTE IN A RAISE FOR THEMSELVES EVERY YEAR
I I HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF FOREIGN I UNDERSTAND GOING INTO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY'VE HAD NATURAL DISASTERS
AND GOING IN AND GIVING RELIEF AID THAT WAY
BUT PAYING FOR THEIR THESE COUNTRIES TO RUN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS
I I'VE GOT A BIG HANG-UP WITH THAT
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY KEEP SAYING WE'RE HELPING THIS COUNTRY OR WE'RE HELPING THAT COUNTRY OUT
WOULDN'T OUR MONEY BE BETTER SPENT HELPING HERE AT AT HOME
THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD AND THAT SUBJECT IN ITSELF I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT ENTIRE THING REVISED
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE
YOU KNOW AND TURN DRASTICALLY
WELL WE'VE GOT
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE THE PEOPLE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE'VE GOT IT
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO MAKE CHANGE
BUT AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT CAREER POLITICIANS THAT SPEND TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE YEARS IN WASHINGTON
PLAYING POWER BROKER THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO T- TAP OUT THE WELL
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN NOT ONLY IN ALL THE STATES BUT IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURES TOO
TWO TERMS THEN THEY GOT TO SIT OUT ONE
AND I THINK
THE THING ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY UP THERE DOING WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE IN THAT OFFICE OR NOT IF THEY HAVE TO SIT OUT A TERM FINE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES
EITHER IN THE CAPACITY OF THE LOBBYIST OR IN
WORKING WITHIN THEIR PARTY OF OF THE STATE OR NATIONAL LEVEL TO GET THINGS ENACTED
THAT'S NOT GOING TO SLOW THEM DOWN AT ALL
I THINK COMPARED TO THE OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITHOUT A DOUBT WE'VE GOT PROBABLY THE BEST SYSTEM IT JUST NEEDS SOME FINE TUNING
WELL THE QUESTION IS WH- WHO'S READY TO PUT THEIR HAND ON THE FIRST WRENCH AND TIGHTEN THE FIRST BOLT
TRYING TO GET
THE UM
POLITICIANS TO ACTUALLY TRUTHFULLY
REPORT WHAT THEY DID VOTE FOR WHAT THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR AT THEIR DESK
IS ALMOST IS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO
THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY OF THEM
AT ANY GIVEN TIME IF YOU'VE BEEN TO WASHINGTON
OKAY UM I THINK THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE EVERYONE NEEDS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPOSURE TO COMMUNITY SERVICE
BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE AND I'M I'M THINKING OF THE COMMU- OF COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN JAIL NOW I THINK THAT MAYBE IF IF
IF SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN EXPOSED TO THE COMMUNITY GOTTEN EXPOSED TO WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DID THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY W- THEY UNDERSTAND PEOPLE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND HELPING PEOPLE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND THE PLIGHT OF PEOPLE
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM I WOULD THINK THAT FOR LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST FILTHY FILTHY RICH
I THINK THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT ALSO IN DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE SO THAT THEY
CAN SEE AND I'M I'M SPEAKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE BORN RICH
AND THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW AND I'M THINKING THAT COMMUNITY SERVICE WOULD HELP THEM UH JUST GET A FEEL OF WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE LIVING YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE TO WORK IN IN UH UH
I DON'T KNOW IN A SOUP KITCHEN OR SOMETHING THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER PEOPLE LIVE
AND UH YOU KNOW ON THE SAME NOTE IF POOR IF
POORER PEOPLE  UH WERE WORKING TO TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY
I DON'T KNOW THEY PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER PERSPECTIVE OF OF I DON'T KNOW JUST LIFE ITSELF
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM
UM-HUM DEMEANOR YEAH UM-HUM
RIGHT
UH-HUH
THAT'S GREAT
UM-HUM AND I- I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THIS ON THE SAME NOTE
BEING HE WAS EXPOSED TO THAT AND MAYBE HE WASN'T BEFORE AND NOW HE SEES AND I THINK THAT ANYBODY THAT WORKS
IN THE IN SOME KIND OF SERVICE OR FOR THE COMMUNITY OR SOMETHING THEY CAN SEE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T SEE WHAT YOU DON'T YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T SEE
YOU KNOW SO AND YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SOME THINGS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE POOR
BUT YOU THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT POOR IS
UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY SEE IT AND YOU KNOW HELP OR SOMETHING
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
THERE'S SOMETHING I I'VE REALLY BEEN SKEPTICAL OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WATCH TELEVISION YOU'LL SEE THE SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR CHILDREN IN OTHER COUNTRIES
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEND LIKE YOU KNOW FIFTY CENTS A DAY
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN HELP A CHILD
IT'S
I DON'T KNOW I GUESS IT'S JUST ME BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TRUST THAT OR NOT
I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY SCAMS AND THINGS GOING ON YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO HELP SOMEBODY
YOU KNOW BUT I JUST I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO
TRUST
THIS THIS COMPANY WHO'S TRYING TO DO THIS OR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO I DON'T KNOW JUST TODAY PEOPLE ARE JUST SO MONEY HUNGRY THAT I THINK THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING
AND SO I MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH MORE SELF-CENTERED UM

AND I PAY I'M PAYING PROBABLY THE HUNDRED OR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS MORE
THAN I WOULD BE PAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THAT TO ME IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY FOR ME TO BE YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY SAFE WHERE I AM

OF WHAT YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR UH YOUNGSTERS THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY DID YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT

UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WHEN I CALLED
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE UM-HUM I AGREE WITH YOU IN THE SENSE THAT UH I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UH ALSO SHARE GIVE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES

IN THE IN UH A WAY OF LIKE SELF-GRATIFICATION TODAY
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SHARING
UH-HUH
YEAH UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH AND I THINK THE PEACE CORPS IS GREAT TOO BECAUSE UH IT YOU GO TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND YOU SEE
UH YOU KNOW IN FACT I SAW AN INTERVIEW ON TV THE OTHER NIGHT WITH UH PATRICK SWAYZE AND HE'S MAKING A MOVIE IN
I THINK IT'S UH
CALCUTTA OR EITHER INDIA SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S A IT'S A VERY POOR POOR COUNTRY
AND HE SAID THAT PEOPLE IN THE WEST
HE SAID SINCE BEING THERE AND I GUESS HE'S BEEN THERE ABOUT SIX MONTHS HE SAID THAT HIS WHOLE IDEA OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT HAS CHANGED
AND HE SAID THAT PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HE SAID OF OF WHAT HUMAN SACRIFICE IS YOU KNOW SINCE BEING THERE HE'S HE'S LEARNED TO WHAT IT IS TO BE POOR AND HAVE NOTHING AND YET THOSE PEOPLE HAVE
UH SUCH UH A HAPPY
UH YEAH IN IN OTHER WORDS THEY DON'T DWELL ON ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEY DWELL ON WHAT THEY DO HAVE AND THEY'RE HAPPY WITH EACH OTHER TYPE OF THING
AND HE SAID THAT OUT HERE HE SAID THAT WHEN HE COMES BACK HE KNOWS THAT IT IT'S JU- COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS LIFE
RIGHT
EXACTLY
UH-HUH
EXACTLY RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
WELL I- I KNOW THAT IT THAT MUST BE TRUE ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF UH YOU KNOW HELPING THEM LEARN HOW TO SURVIVE HOW TO PLANT HOW TO FIND WATER AND I'VE SEEN SO MANY UH
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ON TV THAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE
WORKING IN THE PEACE CORPS AND HOW YOU KNOW UH THE PEOPLE OR THE COMMUNITY THEY WORKED IN IS SO MUCH BETTER
IT'S LIKE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AND I- I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH-HUH
YES
UH-HUH
I KNOW
AND HOW DO YOU
YEAH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
I KNOW
IT'S TRUE IT REALLY IS IT'S THE SAD LIFE I THINK TODAY IT'S UM
IT'S IT IT'S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE EVEN IN IN THE YEARS OF MY GROWING UP I MEAN I'M FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD AND I HAVE SEEN A TOWN CHANGE FROM A TOWN TO A CITY
AND IT'S UH PEOPLE YOU KNOW GROW FROM A SMALL TOWN TO A LARGE TOWN
AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE BETTER YOU KNOW SHARE MORE DO MORE YOU KNOW BE MORE COMMUNITY ORIENTED AND ALL BUT IF THEY JUST GET MORE UH
UNTO THEMSELVES KIND OF
RIGHT AND AND IT'S NOT THE SHARING OF UH A NEIGHBOR TO A NEIGHBOR
AND  WE WOULD GO OUT AND NOT EVEN LOCK OUR DOORS
AND NOT EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT
BUT TODAY I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE YOU WOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF DOING THAT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BARS ON THE WINDOW YOU'RE NOT EVEN SAFE YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IN DALLAS THEY
I WAS GOING TO SAY BECAUSE I- I HEARD UH IN FACT I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE FROM DALLAS UH JUST LAST WEEKEND THEY WAS SAYING THAT UH IN FACT IT WAS THIS ONE GIRL PARTICULARLY THAT WORKED FOR TI AND SHE HAD GONE OVERSEAS TO TOKYO
AND SHE ASKED THEM THERE IF THERE WAS SOME ANYWHERE THAT SHE SHOULDN'T GO BECAUSE SHE WAS ALONE YOU KNOW BEING A GIRL FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING
AND SHE SAID THEY THOUGHT FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEY SAID UH NO THERE'S NOWHERE THAT YOU CAN GO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE AFRAID
THEY SAID TO HER THAT EVEN IF SHE LEFT HER PURSE
ON THE SUBWAY
OKAY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THAT PURSE RETURNED TO HER
THIS IS HOW CONFIDENT THEY WERE OKAY WITH NOTHING MISSING
OKAY THIS IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY
AND YOU WOULD THINK YOU KNOW UH BEING UH AN AMERICAN OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW A FOREIGNER THERE THAT THAT WOULD BE ALL THE MORE REASON THAT THEY'D TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU
OKAY
AND SHE TOLD ME SHE SAID SHE COULD TELL THEM FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES PLACES NOT TO GO IN IN AND AROUND DALLAS
AND THAT'S WHERE SHE WAS FROM
SHE SAID EVEN CHOOSING HER APARTMENT SHE HAD TO BE SO CAREFUL BECAUSE OF BEING A WOMAN ALONE
YOU KNOW SHE HAD THERE ARE CERTAIN
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK IF PEOPLE WERE MORE EXPOSED TO
UH ESPECIALLY UH YOUNG KIDS GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
I MEAN AT ONE TIME THEY WOULD GO INTO THE SERVICE TO HAVE THE SAME EXPOSURE AND YOU KNOW UH TO FURTHER THEIR WORLDLINESS SO TO SPEAK
AND GO TO SEE UH FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT THEY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO SEE IT WAS LIKE THEY SAID JOIN THE NAVY TO SEE THE WORLD TYPE OF THING YOU KNOW
BUT NOWADAYS THEY DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE IT'S NOT UH A THING UH A LOT OF YOUNG MEN DON'T EVEN UH
HAVE THE DESIRE TO GO INTO THE SERVICE
OR TO UH YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE
AND I DON'T KNOW I- I ATTRIBUTED I THINK A LOT OF THAT TO WOMEN WORKING
YOU KNOW TO THE MOTHERS NOT BEING AT HOME
THE BONDING PROCESS YEP
IT VERY DEFINITELY IS
THAT'S RIGHT
YEP
AND THE THING IS LIKE I THINK A MAN CAN AFFORD TO SUPPORT A WOMAN
BUT THE WOMAN AFFORDS THE LUXURIES
IN IN OTHER WORDS LIKE ANYONE CAN LIVE ON A A CERTAIN INCOME NO MATTER WHAT IT IS YOU HAVE TO
SO TO SPEAK OKAY IT IT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU
NOW A FAMILY I- I THINK THAT LIKE GIRLS TODAY HAVE CHILDREN AND SIX WEEKS LATER THEY'RE BACK TO WORK
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A BONDING WITH THAT CHILD THEY DON'T EVE- EVER SEE THE
IT'S IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A CHILD THE FIRST LIKE SAY SIX YEARS OF LIFE
SO MUCH HAPPENS IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME
AND I MEAN ONCE THE CHILD'S IN SCHOOL IF YOU HAD A JOB FROM SAY NINE TO THREE
ALL RIGHT
WHAT UH WHAT BASEBALL TEAMS DO YOU FOLLOW
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
HUM
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH I GUESS MAINLY THE THE RANGERS SUCH AS THEY ARE
THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE A PRETTY TOUGH DIVISION THOUGH WITH OAKLAND AND KANSAS CITY AND WHITE SOX ALL UH
JAMMED IN THERE
OH I GET TO I DON'T KNOW QUITE A FEW IN THE SUMMER
YEAH IT LOOKED LIKE THEY'RE STARTING OFF KIND OF SHAKY BUT THEY THEY'VE GONE I GUESS OVER FIVE HUNDRED NOW
I WAS HOPING THAT NO HITTER THAT HE THREW WOULD WOULD GET THEM FIRED UP A LITTLE BIT
BUT IT'S HARD HARD TO TELL
UH I WAS TRYING TO THINK THEY WERE UP IN A STAND AT DETROIT
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE PLAYING TODAY OR NOT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH IT SAYS A LOT FOR THEIR FUTURE
OH I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THEM A WHOLE LOT UM I I HEAR ABOUT THEM OCCASIONALLY I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHOSE A A TRAINER FOR ONE OF THEIR FARM CLUBS
I THINK SO  WE HEAR OFF AND ON ABOUT THEM THEY'VE NEVER REALLY DONE A WHOLE LOT I MEAN THEY'RE UP AND DOWN KIND OF LIKE THE RANGERS ARE MOST OF THE TIME
IT'S BEEN PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR YEARS SINCE THEY WERE I THINK THEY FINISHED SECOND IN THEIR DIVISION I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY ENDED UP LAST YEAR THIRD OR FOURTH I GUESS
YEAH THEY HAVE BEEN OFF AND ON UH MAYBE MAYBE THREE OR FOUR TIMES SINCE THEY'VE BEEN HERE
UH-HUH
WELL THEY'VE BEEN LIKE A LOT OF TEAMS AND THE MINUTE THEY DO REAL BADLY IN THE PAST THEY JUST GOT GOT RID OF THEIR MANAGER THIS IS VALENTINE'S THE FIRST MANAGER THEY'VE HAD IN ON YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF LENGTH OF TIME
AND SO HOPEFULLY HE'LL EVENTUALLY PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER
I I CAN'T  I DON'T KNOW UH SOMETIMES I THINK HE IS AND SOMETIMES I WONDER
UH-HUH
YEAH TRUE
I GUESS I WAS FEELING PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE TEAM VALENTINE THIS YEAR UNTIL UH HE GOT MAD AT PETE INCAVIGLIA AND JUST CUT HIM FOR BECAUSE HE WAS UPSET AT HIM
WELL I I CAN UNDERSTAND HIS POINT I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF CHILDISH TO JUST CUT HIM INSTEAD OF TRYING TO TRADE HIM BECAUSE THEN DETROIT PICKS HIM UP AND
HE STARTED OUT REAL GOOD FOR THEM AND HE HE'S GOTTEN KIND OF SHAKY NOW
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST GOTTEN SOMETHING FOR HIM
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH I THINK I THINK AS LONG AS HE PRODUCES HE AND FRANCO THEY THEY RUN KIND OF HOT AND COLD TOO
I THINK FRANCO HIT A HOME RUN WAS IT LAST NIGHT TO WIN THE GAME
I THINK THEY WON SIX TO FIVE AND I THINK THAT WAS ON HIS HE HIT A HOME RUN AT THE END AND BROKE THE TIE UP
HUM
YEAH  THAT'D BE NICE
YEAH I THINK THE RANGERS HAVE TH- THE PITCHING STAFF THEY NEED IF THEY WOULD JUST PRODUCE SOME OFFENSE THEY MIGHT DO ALL RIGHT
YEAH YOU SAID YOU WERE A CINCINNATI FAN HAS UH ALL THIS BROUHAHA WITH PETE ROSE OVER THE YEARS
CAUSED CAUSED YOU ANY DISTASTE FOR THEM OR

AND THE DRAFT AND UH
YOU GOT TO LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND BUILDING THE TEAM THROUGH DRAFT PICKS AND STUFF LIKE THAT

YOU KNOW HE HE MESSED UP BUT I STILL THINK HE'S BELONGS IN THE HALL OF FAME AND

YOU KNOW HE'S BEEN THERE HE'S PLAYED A LOT OF BALL HIMSELF
SO HE'S BEEN IN SOME WORLD SERIES AND YOU KNOW HE'S
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AS A PLAYER AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT AS A MANAGER
AND SO
WELL
THANKS FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER BEEN CALLED SO IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING YEAH I USUALLY GET HOME AND PICK UP THE PHONE AND DO SOME CALLING SO UH
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR CALLING
ALL RIGHT TAKE CARE
BYE
SO I PERSONALLY UH DO CONSIDER THE SOVIET UNION A THREAT I- I- I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES AND THAT THERE'S UH UH THE UH
THE MOOD FOR CHANGE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE LEFT TO HAPPEN AND THAT THERE'S STILL UH COMMUNISM WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO DEMOCRACY AND THERE'S STILL MISSILES
YEAH
OH REALLY
YES
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT WELL I GUESS THAT THAT THAT BRINGS UP A QUESTION IS IT THEIR I THINK IN IN THE LONG TERM WE COULD SEE A A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE IN  INCREDIBLE CIVIL WARS
AND THAT THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTRY BREAKS DOWN AND THERE'S STRIFE AND MUCH MUCH DEATH
BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS BE- BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER UH EVENTS THAT COULD HAPPEN INCLUDING A RESURGENCE OF COMMUNISM WITH UH VIOLENT UH BACKLASH AGAINST DEMOCRACY
WH- WHICH IS WHERE WE COULD BE IN THREATENED I GUESS YOU'D SAY
I'M SORRY YOU YOU'RE RIGHT I'M AM MEANING TO SAY CAPITALISM
YES THAT'S TRUE UH-HUH
BUT NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH FROM THE SOVIET UNION'S PEOPLE'S POINT OF VIEW
I- YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT UM-HUM
I SEE
I- I AGREE WITH THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WILL HAPPEN
THE UM WELL ONE THING THAT'S CU- OF INTEREST IS IS IF THE SOVIET UNION'S STRUCTURE DOES BREAK DOWN AND THERE IS CIVIL WAR AT THE END OF THOSE CIVIL WARS OR DURING THOSE CIVIL WARS IN WHOSE HANDS WILL THOSE MISSILES BE
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM UH SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE MANY MANY REPUBLICS
RIGHT ALMOST A TERRORISTIC THOUGHT
YOU KNOW COME HELP US OR WE'LL BOMB YOU
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
I KNOW IT'S ALMOST AMAZING HOW LITTLE YOU HEAR ABOUT DAN QUAYLE AND WHEN YOU DO IT'S USUALLY TOTALLY
YEAH YEAH HE STILL WANTS TO SEND PEOPLE TO MARS
THE GUY'S UH L- L- L- LAME TO SAY THE LEAST
OH WELL SO THAT'S UH WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO BE REAL INTERESTING IS IF WHEN THEY HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
IF BUSH IS GOING TO RUN WITH QUAYLE AGAIN
OR IF HE'S GOING TO RUN WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHICH I THINK WOULD BE UH I WONDER IF THAT'S IF THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THAT WHERE UH THERE'S UH SAME PRESIDENT BUT A DIFFERENT VICE PRESIDENT
IS IT
BUT WITHOUT SOMETHING LIKE DEATH OR IMPEACHMENT
I- I- I CAN'T RECALL
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I GUESS IN THE LAST ELECTIONS IT WAS IT WAS THE LESSER OF SEVERAL EVILS BUT FROM THE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
OH WELL SO LET'S SEE BACK TO THE THAT KEY ISSUE UH
THE THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION WAS WHAT WOULD UH WHAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN TO CONVINCE ME
AND I'D SAY SEEMS TO ME UH THAT THE MISSILES ARE THE THREAT
AND SO WHAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN IS A COMPLETE DISARMAMENT
UH AND UH THAT'S I YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN BUT I DOUBT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS
I DON'T NO
PERSONALLY I- I- I RE- AS I SAID I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE IT HAPPEN BUT I JUST
UM-HUM
OH UNDER THE FE-
I SEE UNDER THE FEAR THAT THAT UH M- MOSCOW GETS BOMBED FIR- THAT'S A GOOD POINT THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT IN FACT
RIGHT
YES I SEE THAT'S A GOOD GREAT POINT
OKAY WELL SO
YEAH IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO BRIAN GOOD DAY BYE-BYE
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE I GUESS I'M I'M CONFUSED UH BY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES AND SO I'M NOT SURE I EVEN RECOGNIZE THE UNITED STATES AS ANYTHING TO BE THREATENED UM
THE UH I GUESS THE MAIN ISSUE IS IS THAT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS BREAKING UP INTO IT'S OWN INTERNAL PROBLEMS
UM AND IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE NICE IF THE VARIOUS UM REPUBLICS SECEDED
ON THE OTHER HAND I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF THE VARIOUS STATES IN OUR UNION SECEDED UH BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT UH
AND IT'S MUCH LESS THAN CLEAR TO ME THAT AS A MILITARY POWER UM THERE'S GOING TO BE ANYTHING LEFT UH GIVEN THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS
UH THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS KEEPING THEIR OWN PEOPLE HAPPY TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW NUKING OTHER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BOTHERING THEM
UM-HUM
I GUESS I'M CO- WHY IS WHY IS COMMUNISM ANTIETHICAL TO DEMOCRACY I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S ANTIETHICAL TO CAPITALISM
OKAY
UH ALL RIGHT BUT WE'VE ALREADY GOT A LOT OF ANTICAPITALISM IN THIS COUNTRY
UM
THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE
UH BUT CERTAINLY THE LATEST RUMORS IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS LET'S SOAK THE RICH SOME MORE SO WE CAN SPREAD OUT THE MONEY
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY COMMUNISM AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
UH
SO UM YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR IT TO HAPPEN
UM
AND THEY SO SO I GUESS SINCE THE PRIMARY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A MILITARY PROBLEM THAT'S LESS THAN CLEAR TO ME I MEAN IF THEY'RE SMART THEY'RE JUST GOING TO LET US HEAD TOWARD COMMUNISM ON OUR OWN VERY MERRY WAY
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT SORT OF THING BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'D GET MORE OUT OF IT THAT WAY
UM
SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I DON'T CONSIDER THEM A THREAT
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW SOMEHOW IMPORT COMMUNISM TO US
UM-HUM
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S THAT CAN BE A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT
UM
YEP YEP
YEAH
UM
OF COURSE THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO WIN FRIENDS BUT YEAH I MEAN I- I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE WHOLE THIRD WORLD ISSUE UH WITH HIM
WITH UH THE SOVIET UNION HAVING UM SUPPORTED UH IRAQ
UH PREVIOUSLY AND AND SO THERE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF POLITICAL POSSIBILITIES UM
BUT YOU KNOW JUST JUST TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE I MEAN GEORGE BUSH WAS RECENTLY IN THE HOSPITAL
AND SO FOR A MOMENT DAN QUAYLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
YEAH
IT'S A JOKE
RIGHT
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH
UH I THINK SO I CAN'T THINK OFF HAND WHO
YEAH

RIGHT AND ALSO HE WAS BASICALLY UNKNOWN SO I MEAN YOU'RE JUST LIKE OKAY SO IT'S IT'S BUSH AND SOMEBODY ELSE
UM-HUM

YOU DON'T THINK SO
I JUST I CAN'T SEE THEM MAINTAINING THE MISSILE BASES IN FACT I THINK IF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT STARTS RETREATING YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THESE CIVIL WARS AND STUFF THE FIRST THING THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS CLOSE DOWN THE MISSILE BASES IN THE REPUBLICS
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT THEM TO FALL INTO THE REPUBLIC'S HANDS
MIGHT BE USED AGAINST THEM THAT'S RIGHT
AND SO I THINK JUST FROM THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME LIMITED AMOUNTS OF DISARMAMENT THEY'LL STILL BE REPUBLICS WITH THE MISSILES THE ONES THAT ARE UNDER THE FIRMER CONTROL OF THE OF THE SOVIETS
UH BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW LIKE LITHUANIA AND STUFF I THINK WOULD LOSE THEIRS

I THINK THEY DID A GREAT JOB
UH-HUH AND YOU COULD ALWAYS FIND SOME CHANNEL THAT HAD SOMETHING ON BUT YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WATCH THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME

WELL THEY DO HAVE TELEVISION MONITORS STATIONED THROUGHOUT OUR BUILDINGS AND THEY USED TO HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED T NEWS AND JUST UPDATES OF OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON WITHIN TI WELL WHEN ALL THE THE MESS WITH UH
IN THE PERSIAN GULF CAME ABOUT THEY STARTED CARRYING CNN

SO WE CAN ALWAYS RUN UPSTAIRS AND YOU KNOW CA- GET A QUICKIE UPDATE ON WHAT'S GOING ON IF WE REALLY WANT TO
YEAH YEAH
YES
YEAH WE DON'T GET IT EITHER WE LIVE OUT IN THE COUNTRY AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT AVAILABLE OUT THERE WHERE WE ARE
BUT WHEN WE DID HAVE IT UH WE THAT'S WHAT WE USUALLY WATCHED WAS CNN AND SOMETIME WE'D WATCH THE WEATHER STATIONS
YEAH
OH I GET THAT TOO BECAUSE I I'M IN A VAN POOL AND I'M IN THE VAN YOU KNOW UH TWO HOURS A DAY AN YES YES AND IN THE IN THE MORNING I TRY TO SLEEP BECAUSE IT'S IT'S DARK THIRTY

UH HER HUSBAND IS IN THE M- NAVY AND HE'S STATIONED AT BETHESDA AND
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH NO I'D I'D RATHER HAVE BALTIMORE WITH THE HOME TOWN ATMOSPHERE
WELL MOST OF WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IN WASHINGTON IS IS THE
CRIME PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE HAVING THERE
UH-HUH I HEARD ABOUT THAT
YEAH WELL I KNOW BOTH OF MY KIDS DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE ANYWHERE AROUND THE THE DOWNTOWN AREAS THEY BOTH MOVED WAY OUT
I THINK ONE OF THEM LIVES IN GERMANTOWN AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE THE OTHER ONE LIVES
UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S MEANS THEY HAVE TO DRIVE A LITTLE BIT BUT
UH WELL NOW I I THINK HE CARPOOLS BECAUSE HE'S GOT FAIRLY REGULAR HOURS SINCE HE CAME BACK BUT UH NOW MY DAUGHTER HA-  THEY HAVE PROBABLY BEEN CARPOOLING TOGETHER IN FACT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN CALLED BACK UP ACTIVE DUTY
AND THEN SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF ACTIVE DUTY AS OF LAST FRIDAY
SO I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THEM THIS WEEKEND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS BUT SHE WAS
WE WERE GONE UH
NO WE WEREN'T HOME BUT SHE HAD SHE HAD LE- CALLED AND LEFT A MESSAGE ON OUR RECORDER BUT I HAD THAT FROM ALL MY KIDS EXCEPT FOR ONE
SO
WELL I THANK YOU FOR CALLING I HAVE ENJOYED IT I REALLY DO LIKE THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I GET TO TALK TO PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES YEAH
THANK YOU BYE BYE
ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN YOUR AREA
OKAY
SURE UH-HUH
YEAH I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT EITHER THE THE ROBIN HOOD APPROACH WHERE THE RICH GIVE TO THE POOR
NO I DON'T PEOPLE MOVE TO THE SUBURBS TO RICHARDSON AND PLANO UH UH MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION THAT'S OFFERED
YEAH WELL IT COSTS UH SO MUCH IN TAXES HERE AND UH EVEN IF THEY DO GIVE MONEY TO THE POORER SCHOOL DISTRICTS I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO LOWER MY TAXES AT ALL
YEAH
SURE
WELL THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WHAT THEIR DOING UM
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE TALENT AS FAR AS THE SCHOOL TEACHING UH GOES
YEAH
WELL I THINK IT IS TOO UH EVER-
NO I WENT TO SCHOOL IN WISCONSIN
RIGHT
UH-HUH WELL WE NEED QUALIFIED TEACHERS NO MATTER WHETHER THEY'RE TEACHING IN THE INNER CITY OR THE SUBURBS
UH THE TROUBLE IS THAT UH THE SUBURBS ARE ABLE TO PAY MORE THAT'S GOING TO ATTRACT THE THE BETTER UH TEACHERS
SURE AND UH IT COST MORE IN TAX MONEY TOO SO
WELL IT COULD VERY WELL BE UH THERE IS A DEFINITE RACIAL SPLIT HERE
WELL I WAS IN A RURAL AREA IN WISCONSIN AND UH WE HAD A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS GREAT I THINK THE CURRICULUM WAS VERY DEFICIENT TO PREPARE PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE
BUT UH THE THE RACIAL MIX OF UM STUDENTS IN MY AREA WAS ENTIRELY WHITE WE HAD UH NO MINORITIES AT ALL
OKAY WELL THAT'S INTERESTING
HUH
RIGHT
SURE
WELL THE GOOD SCHOOL DISTRICTS HERE DO HAVE HONORS PROGRAMS UH THEY DO ENCOURAGE THAT AMONG THE STUDENTS WHO ARE UH PREPARED TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT UH THAT BRINGS UP A WHOLE UH BUNCH OF OTHER PROBLEMS UM
SURE
ALL RIGHT I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET
THAT'S INTERESTING I KNOW SOME PEOPLE AT WORK WHO UH HAVE UH CHILDREN IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AT ALL AND THEY DO SEND THEIR KIDS TO THE PRIV- S- PRIVATE SCHOOLS
UM THEY SEND THEM TO SAINT MARKS I THINK WHERE EVER THAT'S LOCATED
YEAH UH-HUH
WELL H- HE SAID ABOUT SIX HUNDRED A MONTH AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THEIR PERSONAL EXPENSE
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UH COLLEGE UH LEVEL FEES HERE
SURE BUT I THINK I THINK THE HONORS PROGRAMS ARE GOOD IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS BUT UH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU GET ARE THE KIDS THAT ARE IN THOSE PROGRAMS GET HARASSED BY THEIR PEERS
FOR DOING TOO WELL
AND THAT DISCOURAGES THEM FROM DOING WELL
SO UH
YEAH
UH-HUH
WELL THEIR ALLOWED TO PROGRESS AT THEIR OWN PACE THEN
ALL RIGHT
NO
I CAN RELATE TO PART OF THAT UH IN IN MY HIGH SCHOOL UH SAY JUST FOR FOR EXAMPLE IN MY MATH COURSES UH I I WAS NOT TO BRAG ABOUT THIS AT ALL I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO CLASS
AND I GOT TO SIT BY MYSELF IN AN EMPTY ROOM WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS IN CLASS TAKING ALGEBRA AN- WORK AT MY OWN PACE
SURE
YEAH
YEAH I'M SURE THAT HAS A DEFINITE EFFECT
YEAH
WELL I I KNOW PEOPLE UH I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS EITHER BUT UH FR- I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN NEIGHBORS ONCE UPON A TIME
WHO HAD KIDS AND WHENEVER THE FATHER WAS TRAVELING AWAY ON BUSINESS OR THEY THEY HAD FINANCIAL PROBLEMS THEIR KIDS UH THEIR IT WAS DEFINITELY NOTICED AT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL
YEAH IT GOT SO BAD WITH WITH THIS ONE KID THAT UH THE THE SCHOOL UH CALLED THEIR PARENTS UP TO ASK IF THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS GOING ON
BECAUSE HIS PERFORMANCE AT SCHOOL HAD DEGRADED SO MUCH
I I BELIEVE IN THAT
YEAH
RIGHT WELL I REMEMBER AS A KID UH THEY HAD PTA PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION MEETINGS ALL THE TIME
AND UH MY PARENTS ALWAYS WENT TO THOSE UH
I I DON'T KNOW
SURE
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL THE THE DROPOUT RATE IS SO HIGH IN DALLAS AND FORT WORTH UH YES IT IS I I THINK IT'S UH THIRTY EIGHT PER-
UH WELL WE DON'T HAVE CHILDREN BUT UM FROM WHAT OUR PEERS TELL US UM MOST OF THEM DO ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE WAY THE DALLAS PUBLIC WELL I SHOULDN'T GET SPECIFIC THE WAY THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS RUN HERE
UM THEY JUST DON'T FEEL THAT UM THE QUALITY OF THE TEACHERS AND THE QUALITY OF THE UH CURRICULUM AND THEY ACTUALLY SEND THEM TO UH THE SUBURBAN AREAS I I GUESS IT'S OKAY IF I SAY THE AREA PLANO
UM AND I THINK ONE THING THAT THE STATE'S DOING RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE REFUNDING I THINK IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR IT'S NOT THAT I
YEAH
YEAH I- IS THAT THE BASIC REASON YOU DON'T AGREE WITH IT
YEAH
YEAH AND THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR IT I MEAN I YOU KNOW UM I KNOW WE USED TO LIVE IN GARLAND AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THERE SENT THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE UM THEY JUST DIDN'T LIKE WHAT WAS GOING ON
UH-HUH
I KNOW IT I MEAN I LOOK AT HIGH SCHOOLS LIKE UM WHAT WAS THE ONE IN RICHARDSON J J PEARCE HIGH SCHOOL THAT JUST WON THE NATIONAL ACADEMIC SOME KIND OF UM
UH CHAMPIONSHIP OR TOURNAMENT THAT THEY HAD FOR ACADEMICS AND THAT RICHARDSON IS ONE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BE HIT BY TAKING AWAY FROM THEM
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO SAY IT THE ROBIN HOOD UM APPROACH
YEAH
YOU KNOW I USED TO WORK AT EDS AND ROSS PEROT YOU KNOW THE BIG JOKE SOMETIMES UM ABOUT HIM BUT THE ONE THING HE DID A FEW YEARS BACK IN TESTING THE COMPETENCY OF THE UH FACULTY
I STILL THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHE- DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN TEXAS
AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN CHICAGO SO I CAN TELL YOU IT'S PROBABLY THE SAME TYPE OF THING THAT UM I HAD A REALLY GOOD EDUCATION BUT IT WASN'T WHERE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS AN INNER CITY BUT IT THE FACULTY WAS VERY GOOD
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT Y-
RIGHT
UH-HUH
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE I MEAN I'D GO WHERE I WOULD BE COMPENSATED THE MOST
YEAH I MEAN IT'S YEAH IN TEXAS I DON'T KNOW I DON'T IF IT'S BECAUSE OF UM THE INFLUX OF MINORITY UH IN TERMS OF THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PLEASE ALL PEOPLE AND THEIR NOT PLEASING ANYBODY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT REALLY
YEAH I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EXACTLY IT OR NOT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE UM
WELL I DON'T KNOW SCHOOLS IN WISCONSIN I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOME OF THE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT THE SCHOOLS UP NORTH COMPARED TO DOWN HERE
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE DOWN HERE THAT UNLESS YOU'RE IN A SUBURBAN ENTITY THEIR SAT SCORES THEIR READING COMPREHENSION LEVELS THEY'RE JUST NOT AS HIGH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
AND MINE WAS UH MINE WAS COMPLETELY UM HISPANIC IN TERMS OF PUERTO RICAN UH CAUCASIAN AND EASTERN EUROPEAN
UH
IT WAS VERY ECLECTIC UM BUT THE TEACHERS WERE WHAT DID CURRICULUM I MEAN THEY HAD THINGS LIKE PHILOSOPHY AND JOURNALISM I MEAN
BUT THERE WASN'T A UH REAL FOR PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF THAT KNEW THEY WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL AND KNEW THEY WANTED TO UM GO TO A FAIRLY COMPETITIVE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IT WASN'T WHAT I WOULD CALL A UH A CAREER A ACADEMIC
PA- PREPARATORY PATH FOR COLLEGE PREP UM AS OPPOSED TO SUBURBAN SCHOOLS LIKE EVANSTON ILLINOIS WHICH HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST  YOU KNOW
UH STUDENT BODIES IN THE COUNTRY AND THE AND THE MONEY BASE TO GO WITH IT UM
I DON'T KNOW I JUST LOOK AT HIGH SCHOOLS LIKE PLANO EAST AND WEST AND THE ONES IN RICHARDSON AND I THINK WELL YOU KNOW I WOULD SEND A CHILD THERE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH I MEAN MY HIGH SCHOOL DID HAVE HONORS PROGRAMS AND I WAS IN IT BUT IT REALLY YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH DIFFERENT IT WAS COMPARED TO IN TERMS OF CITY NOW THERE IS A HIGH SCHOOL UM
IS IT WTT WHITE OR IS IT JEFFERSON I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM UM BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT THE OF ONE OR TWO THAT ARE VERY GOOD BUT OUT OF HOW MANY YOU KNOW FIFTY TO SIXTY HIGH SCHOOLS
IT'S JUST UM AND THEN I READ THE OTHER DAY THAT PLANO WAS GOING TO BE THE SITE FOR A POSSIBLY NEW UM PAROCHIAL OR CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL
SOMETHING LIKE TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST ONES IN THE SOUTHWEST OR SOMETHING YEAH
UH-HUH
DO THEY SEE AND ARE THEY IN PLANO OR ARE THEY IN D- DALLAS
OKAY YEAH YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE MORE UM YEAH I HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT UH HAVE YOUNGER CHILDREN AND THEY SEND THEM TO THE MONTESSORI SYSTEM
UM AND WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THEY'RE PAYING YOU JUST
OH MY GOODNESS
YEAH TWELVE YEARS AND YOU ADD MORE THAN ONE CHILD TO THAT AND YOU SAY OH MY GOODNESS YEAH I
THIS IS TRUE YES I CAN PERSONALLY RELATE TO THAT YES
UH-HUH I DON'T KNOW I THINK ONE THING THE UNITED STATES DOES UM MY STEPFATHER'S FROM ENGLAND AND ONE THING THEY DO THEIR AT LEAST IN IN THE SECTION OF LONDON WHERE HE WAS FROM THAT THEY UM
THEY ACTUALLY THEY CALL THEM EXTERNSHIPS BUT THEY ACTUALLY THE CHILD'S UM UH THEY GO BY FORMS THEY DON'T GO BY GRADES AND I GUESS I GUESS
WHAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF OUR EARLY HIGH SCHOOL NINE TENTH GRADE THEY CALL IT THE TENTH OF ELEVENTH FORM UM
THEY ACTUALLY ARE FORCED TO TAKE TIME OFF AND PICK AN AREA OF STUDY IT'S PROCTORED IT'S YOU KNOW REGULATED AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING UM BUT THEY ACTUALLY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE LIBRARY AND DO THEIR OWN THING ON A PARTICULAR SUBJECT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS
IT HAS TO BE ACADEMIC BUT THEY IT'S FREE OF THEIR CHOOSING
RIGHT IN THAT ONE JUST FOR THAT ONE PARTICULAR SEMESTER QUARTER OR WHAT EVER YOU KNOW THAT ONE QUARTER UH A STUDY UNIT WOULD BE
AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK WE DO ENOUGH OF THAT HERE IN TERMS OF GETTING CHILDREN TO THINK INDEPENDENTLY
UH-HUH
OH MY
UH-HUH
SEE YEAH
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I MEAN UM UH I MEAN WE CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I'M NOT BRAGGING EITHER BUT IT'S THE SAME THING I MEAN I TOOK AP OR ADVANCED PLACEMENT CLASSES
AND I- THERE WERE THINGS THAT I PROBABLY KNEW ABOUT IN OTHER SEGMENTS BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T OFFER THEM I MEAN THEY OFFERED THEM IN THINGS LIKE ENGLISH AND CHEMISTRY
TWO THINGS THAT WERE OBSCURE TO WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN IN TERMS OF UM A CAREER UM
I THINK PART OF THE THING ABOUT SCHOOLS TODAY IS TOO IS THE WAY THE FAMILIES HAVE GONE DOWN THE TUBES THE STRUCTURE THAT NOW TEACHERS PLAY POLICE OFFICERS YOU KNOW THEIR PARENTING THEIR DISCIPLINARIANS
YOU KNOW AND I'M DOING THI- ALL THIS SECOND HAND WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS IN SCHOOL OR ANYTHING SO I CAN'T
UH-HUH
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING I MEAN ARE PARENTS
OH GOODNESS
I MEAN I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE GROWING UP NOW A DAYS THAT'S ONE THING UM BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SOLVE THAT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THE ACADEMIC PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW I THINK OF TWO OR THREE THINGS IN MY MIND I THINK TEACHERS SHOULD BE TESTED
AND THEY PROBABLY WOULD SHOOT ME IF THEY HEARD THAT AND I KNOW A LOT OF TEACHERS UM TWO I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE FUNDING OR THE MONEY WHERE THE PROVEN PROGRAMS ARE
AND THREE I DO THINK THAT PARENTS NEED TO BE MORE INVOLVED I DON'T KNOW I JUST IT'S PROBABLY EASY TO SAY BECAUSE NONE OF US HAVE CHILDREN BUT UM I JUST
YEAH
ASSOCIATION
YEAH
YEAH MINE TOO I MEAN AND DO THEY HAVE THOSE ANYMORE I MEAN I DON'T EVEN
I DON'T HAVE ANY UH BUT YOU KNOW JUST THE OTHER DAY WE WERE SOMEWHERE ACTUALLY ON SATURDAY WE WERE IN THE PARK CITIES ORDERING IN A WE WERE IN A SPECIALTY UH FOOD SHOP ORDERING SOMETHING TO SEND OUT OF STATE AND
THE MAN WE WERE ALL UPON THE TOPIC OF ADOPTION WHICH MAY BE IN OUR FUTURE UM IF WE'RE REAL LUCKY AT ANY RATE HE WAS SAYING HOW HE WAS GLAD THAT HIS TWO CHILDREN ONE BIOLOGICAL ONE NATURAL UM THIS HAD TO DO WITH THE ADOPT- THE ADOPTED ONE WHICH
BIOLOGICAL I MEAN ONE ADOPTED ONE NATURAL UM THAT'S IRRELEVANT BUT HE WAS SAYING THAT UH MY HUSBAND SAID AND WHAT DOES YOUR SON IS VERY GOOD LOOKING WHAT IS HE WELL HE'S NINETEEN HE GRADUATED LAST YEAR UM BUT HE'S INTERESTED IN THEATER AND HE'S JUST GOING TO RICHLAND AND
HE SAID YOU KNOW HE SAID I'M NOT CALLING HIM STUPID OR SLOW HE JUST HE SAID HE DID REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO STUDY AND HE GOES AND YOU KNOW HE LEANED OVER TO MY HUSBAND AND HE SAID WELL YOU KNOW SO AND SO HE SAID WHEN YOU HAVE THEM IF YOU GET ONE WHAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND IS YOU'LL JUST BE GLAD IF THEY DON'T YOU DON'T GET A CALL FROM THE POLICE
AND HE SAID OUR SON MARK YOU KNOW BLAH BLAH BLAH UM HE MAY BE HAVE ONLY BEEN A C STUDENT BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM HE SAID AND WHEN YOU RAISE A CHILD IN TODAY'S SOCIETY HE YOU'RE JUST GLAD THEY MAKE IT THROUGH SCHOOL

BAD POINTS OF WATCHING IT EACH EACH DIFFERENT ONE I MEAN YOU MAY NOT SEE A SPECTACULAR MICHAEL JORDANISH MOVE FROM A HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER BUT YOU KNOW IT'S MORE OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT IF IF THEY HIT

YOU KNOW I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S INTERESTING WE WE REALLY WATCH THE BIG NAME PLAYERS AND BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE A SOLID TEAM UNDERNEATH OR ELSE THEY REALLY DON'T DON'T GO ANYWHERE
SO I I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE MAVERICKS PROBLEM THEY HAVE OKAY PLAYERS BUT SOMETIMES THE STRONGNESS OF THE TEAM ISN'T TOGETHER
YOU KNOW EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY CLICK DURING A A GAME AND THEN IT WORKS FOR THEM BUT THEN IT'S JUST NOT ALWAYS THERE
SO I I GUESS THAT'S

I DON'T I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF COACHES IN THE IN THE NBA THOUGH

I GUESS I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF OF THE QUICKNESS OF IT UM AND AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT TAKES THE PLAYERS
HAVE TO BE
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A GAME WHERE YOU CAN JUST NOT PRACTICE I MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE ON THE TOP OF THEIR GAME TO BE IN THE NBA I THINK

BUT IT FASCINATES ME THE WAY THEY'VE DONE IT AND IT'S IT LOOKS GOOD IT'S ALL DONE IN BRICK THE WINDOWS EVEN VARY ON IT
AND THAT'S IT REALLY FASCINATES ME SO I'VE SAT ACROSS THE STREET FROM IT AND I'VE TRIED TO PUT IT DOWN ON THE PAPER NOW
IT'S ON UM
LET'S SEE FIFTEENTH AND UH PARK
WELL I LIVE RIGHT AROUND HERE
BUT IT'S NOT IF YOU DRIVE BY IT YOU DON'T NOTICE IT
BECAUSE IT'S ALL BRICK THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN THE FRONT EXCEPT YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IF YOU ACTUALLY STOP AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THAT'S WHY IT FASCINATES ME
BUT UH AGAIN YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT SOMEDAY AND ACTUALLY MAKE A HOUSE OF MY OWN
WELL SEE YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR GAZEBO YOU'RE PLAYING WITH NUMBERS
THAT'S ALL THIS IS YOU PUTTING IT ON PAPER SO YOU'RE JUST PLAYING WITH NUMBERS
IT'S LIKE I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WITH WORK BUT I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH IN MY HANDS
ANYMORE TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT I'VE PUT UP UH
LIKE UM A WALL BOARD FIXED A BEDROOM AND PUT IN A BATH
YEAH I HAVE A SMALL MITER BOX UH FOR HOBBY MITERING
AND IT DOES THE SAME THING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I'D LIKE TO WHICH I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND TO GO INTO AS FAR AS A PERMANENT HOBBY WHICH BECAUSE I'M HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THIS IS TO GO INTO UH I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN IT IS THOSE WOOD
UH
OH THEY'RE THEY'RE WOOD PICTURES ON THE WALL BUT IF ONE MOVE IF ONE PART MOVES IT COUNTERPARTS THE OTHER PARTS
AND SO LIKE IT'S A CONTINUOUS COUNTERPART AROUND IT
AND IT'S ALL MADE OUT OF WOOD
AND I HAVE AS I SAID I HAVE A MINIATURE UH
MITER BOX WHICH IS MADE FOR HOBBY WORKS
AND I'VE HAD THAT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY GONE INTO THAT PART I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MAKING UM
OH LADDERS AND EVERYTHING FOR MY UH POCKET PARROT BECAUSE THEY'RE HARD TO FIND TOYS FOR A POCKET PARROT THEY MAKE THEM FOR PARROTS AND THEY MAKE THEM FOR COCKATIELS AND A POCKET PARROT'S BETWEEN THE TWO
AND SO I NEED RINGS THAT ARE EXACTLY BETWEEN THOSE TWO SIZES SO I'M GOING TO I'VE GOT SOME DESIGNS FOR I GO INTO THE PET STORES BUT YOU CAN SAY AGAIN ANOTHER HOBBY I'VE GOT IS MY BIRDS SO
HUM
I HAVE A COCKATIEL AND A POCKET PARROT
BUT UM
OTHER THAN THAT
UH SAM UH COCKATIEL TALKS HE WHISTLES AT ME AND SAYS GOOD MORNING
UH HE PICKED UP MOST OF HIS SAYINGS FROM THE OTHER COCKATIEL I HAD THE POCKET PARROT IS A VERY QUIET BIRD IT'S AN EXTREMELY TAME BIRD
IT'S UH IF YOU'RE REAL GENTLE WITH IT WHEN YOU BUY IT IT'LL COME OUT AND SIT ON YOUR SHOULDER WITH NO PROBLEM
YEAH THEY'RE A VERY VERY TENDER BIRD
WELL SEE WHEN I WAS OH ABOUT I GUESS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN THAT LONG I TOOK MY DOG MY CAT AND MY BIRD INTO THE VET AT THE SAME TIME
AND HE WAS JUST SITTING THERE HE GOES CAROL YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I KNOW OF THAT DOES THIS AND I GO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ONE THING AT ALL ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE THE DOG AND THE CAT AND THE BIRD ARE ALL OUT OF THE CAGE
AND UH M- MY BIRD AT THAT TIME WAS PICKING THE FEATHERS OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HIS WING
AND UH HE FINALLY SAID WELL YOU OUGHT TO GET IT A MATE BUT THE BIRD TURNED AROUND AND BIT HIM HE WAS FURIOUS HE WAS SO MAD AT ME BUT YEAH HE HAD A PICTURE OF MY BIRDS
SITTING ON TOP OF THE CAGE WITH ONE TAIL INSIDE OF A FRONT OF A CAT'S FACE AND THE TAIL OF ANOTHER CAT WALKING UNDERNEATH THE CAGE
SO HE JUST LOVED IT HE JUST ABSOLUTELY ADORED IT
WELL THE ONE LARGE CAT THAT I STILL HAVE UH HE TOOK CLAW MARKS AND PUT IT DOWN MY DRAPES GOING AFTER THE BIRDS SITTING OUT ON A
BIRD RACK THAT WE SET UP OUTSIDE FOR BIRDS
GOING AFTER THE BIRDS
AND THEN HE'D GET DOWN AND JUMP BACK UP ON THE TABLE AND SIT NEXT TO A CAGE THAT HAD TWO COCKATIELS OUT ON TOP OF THE CAGE I'D GET SO MAD AT THAT CAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT HE WAS DOING UNTIL I SAW THESE BIG CLAW MARKS GOING DOWN MY
DRAPES FROM HIS BACK CLAWS
YEAH I DIDN'T THINK I DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT TOO MUCH I MEAN IT'S RATHER I THOUGHT IT WAS RATHER FUNNY HERE'S A BIRD DOING THIS AND TWO BIRDS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM BUT
I MEAN THE BIRDS WERE OUT THEY WEREN'T IN THE CAGE THEY WERE OUT I NEVER LEFT THEM IN SO BUT I THOUGHT BUT I STILL HAVE THAT CAT IN FACT I HAVE BOTH CATS WHICH ARE MY KIDS' CATS BUT THE BIRDS ARE IN HERE WITH THE CATS THEY DON'T CARE
THEY KEEP AN EYE ON ANY CAT THAT WALKS OUTSIDE BUT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE CATS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS I'VE SEEN

THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH AT LEAST I I JUST CONSIDER MYSELF BLESSED THAT I CAN STAY HOME  IT UH
I KNOW
I KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH IT HAS
I BELIEVE THAT TOO AND I THINK UH
THE KIDS ARE WHERE THEY NEED TO YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE CHILDREN IN THE WOR- IN THIS
COUNTRY

OH IT IT REALLY DOES I  JUST THE WHOLE UH
YOU KNOW SEEING HOW YOU REALLY ARE CRE- ARE ARE FORMING THIS YOU KNOW THE MIND
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
OR OR THEY JUST PUT IT IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND AND LET IT SLIDE I
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST SAY WELL YOU KNOW HE'LL LEARN EVERYTHING WHEN HE GETS INTO
UH YOU KNOW
BUT IT UM
I I KNOW EVEN JUST THIS FIRST YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN WITH UH MY SON H- HERE UM HE'S I CAN JUST SEE HOW MUCH
OF OF A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES STAYING HOME WITH HIM INSTEAD OF UH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
WELL IT'S NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
OKAY BYE BYE
WHERE ARE YOU FROM TINA
UM-HUM
YEAH UH-HUH I HAVE I HAVE TWO CHILDREN I HAVE A SEVEN YEAR OLD AND A THREE YEAR OLD
AND UH SO I TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH THEM
WELL UM
W-
WE DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH THEM YOU KNOW TAY- TAYLOR MY YOUNGEST IS OR MY OLDEST IS IN SCHOOL AND SO SHE HAS A LOT OF SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
HO- WAS IT A BIG CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE TO UH HAVE A CHILD
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH UH-HUH WHAT DO YOU DO DURING THOSE THOSE DAYS
YEAH WELL YOU SAID YOU SAID YOU WORKED A COUPLE DAYS A MONTH THOUGH WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU DO
OH ARE YOU
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH
THEY REALLY GROW UP QUICK ESPECIALLY AT THAT EARLY AGE
BUT MY MY WIFE WAS UH SHE WORKED PART TIME WHEN MY OLDEST WAS WAS LITTLE AND NOW SHE'S STAYING HOME ALL THE TIME BUT UH THAT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL BECAUSE IT'S A BIG TRANSITION I THINK TO HAVE CHILDREN
YOU KNOW TO GO FROM YOU KNOW NOTHING YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING EVERY NIGHT THAT'S FINE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE SO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU I
I I THINK THAT
MY WIFE LEANED THAT WAY AND I'M REALLY GLAD SHE DID AND YOU KNOW I'M GLAD SHE'S STAYING HOME BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE ARE SOME DAYS WHEN SHE WI- SHE WISHES SHE WAS BACK AT WORK BUT
YEAH
YEAH WELL SEE THAT'S THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD MY WIFE DID TOO BECAUSE SHE WORKED EITHER TWO TO THR- THREE DAYS A WEEK AND THAT GOT HER OUT OF THE HOUSE AND YET SHE'D GET TO SPEND YOU KNOW
THREE OR FOUR DAYS WITH YEAH YEAH AND SO
YEAH I DO TO I AGREE BUT THEN WHEN YOU START HAVING TWO OF THEM IT'S YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT TOUGHER
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY TO MAKE THAT PAYOFF AND STUFF
ARE ARE YOU FROM THE MARYLAND AREA
REALLY
UM UH I'M IN DALLAS TEXAS
YEAH
SO UH I'M I'VE LIVED HERE LIKE EIGHT YEARS OR SO MY WIFE'S FROM FORT WORTH
BUT
YEAH I WORK FOR TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
YEAH THAT EXPLAINS IT DOESN'T IT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WHAT'S YOUR HUSBAND DO
UH-HUH
OH
OH YEAH I'M SURE IT DOES
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH WHAT UH MY WIFE DID SOME TEACHING AT LIKE UH
LIKE A PRIVATE TUTORING PLACE
A SYLVAN LEARNING CENTER THIS YEAR AND SO THAT THAT GOT ME TO SP- TO BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE KIDS AT NIGHT AND STUFF YOU KNOW
BECAUSE NORMALLY IF IF THEY NEED SOMETHING THEY JUST GO TO MOM
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS I MEAN I COU- I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DOING IT FOR THEM BUT
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO GO TO MOM I GUESS THEY GET USED TO IT
SO BUT YOU KNOW WE'D GO TO THE LIBRARY AND DO THINGS LIKE THAT YEAH
BUT
OH YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH IT REALLY DOES BECAUSE I THINK YOU YOU KNOW YOU GROW CLOSER WAS YOUR UH WAS YOUR HUSBAND I MEAN NATURALLY A CHILD I MEAN HA- HAD HE BEEN AROUND CHILDREN OR
OH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND
UM YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEN
YOU'RE NOT GETTING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH AT HOME I MEAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT GETTING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AT HOME AS HE'D WANT TO
SO YEAH THAT THAT'S A TOUGH SITUATION BUT THEN THEN AGAIN YOU KNOW SOME YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
YOU KNOW TO GET ALONG TOO SO
UH-HUH WE- WELL LIKE I SAID MY WIFE NORMALLY FEELS THAT WAY THERE ARE DAYS WHEN UH I COME HOME AND SHE SAYS HERE TAKE THESE KIDS I'M GETTING OUT
SO SHE'S SHE'S HAD ABOUT ENOUGH DURING THOSE DAYS
BUT BUT FOR THE MOST PART I YOU KNOW I'VE REALLY FEEL LIKE THAT'S LED THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT JUST LIKE WHAT YOU SAID WITH THE COST OF LIVING AND EVERYTHING I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET BY ON JUST ONE SALARY AN
AND WON'T
AND SO I THINK THAT'S LE- TENDED TO LEAD TO A DECLINE IN IN FAMILIES AND FAMILY VALUES ESPECIALLY
AND I REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE NATION'S FACING THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YEAH
YEAH WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE SAID THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
DO YOU THINK
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
IT'S AMAZING HOW YOUR WHOLE FOCUS ON LIFE CHANGES AFTER YOU'VE HAD A CHILD
UH-HUH
WELL YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO YOU'LL SEE SO MANY INSTANCES WHERE YOU KNOW HE'LL MIMIC SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE DONE AND YOU SEE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I'M DOING HE'S LEARNING FROM
AND AND YOU THINK IF I WASN'T HERE HE'D BE LEARNING THAT FROM A BABYSITTER OR FROM A DAY CARE
YOU KNOW TH- THAT'S HOW THEY'RE DEVELOPING THEIR PATTERNS AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE EITHER DON'T CARE OR DON'T REALIZE IT YOU KNOW THAT'S
YEAH
YEAH EVENTUALLY
YEAH IT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH PLUS PLUS I THINK IT BECOMES PART OF Y- PART OF YOU TOO I MEAN YOU GET TO STAY HOME I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST FOR HIM BUT IT'S ALSO FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE BOTH KIND OF BONDING TOGETHER THERE TOO I THINK
SO
WELL IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU
OKAY GOOD LUCK OKAY GOOD BYE
OKAY CATHARINE CAN YOU UH GIVE ME YOUR VIEWS ON UH  WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE UH CARE OF ELDERLY
UM YEAH
UH WE UH JUST WENT THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE UM
BOTH MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY FAIRLY YOUNG AND UH
MY WIFE'S MOTHER DIED WHEN SHE WAS ONLY NINE YEARS OLD SO THE ONLY ONE THAT WE REALLY HAD WAS HER FATHER  AND UH
UH HE'S NO LONGER WITH US HE PASSED AWAY WHEN HE WAS UH HE WAS GOING ON EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD SO HE HAD A GOOD LONG LIFE
BUT HE ALWAYS MAINTAINED HIS OWN APARTMENT HE LIVED IN THE CITY HE LIVED IN UH RHODE ISLA- IN FACT WE LIVE IN RHODE ISLAND I WORK IN IN THE MASSACHUSETTS PLANT BUT I LIVE IN RHODE ISLAND
HE'S ALWAYS LIVED IN THE IN THE CITY AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF INDEPENDENT HE'S UH
HE'S NEVER HAD A A NEVER OWNED AN AUTOMOBILE NEVER HAD A DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU KNOW HE'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW YEAH
HE GOT AROUND YEAH YEAH BECAUSE HE LIVED RIGHT DOWN DOWN CITY IN THE IN THE
PORT AUTHORITIES RIGHT THERE SO HE USED TO TAKE THE STEAMER DOWN TO NEW YORK AND YOU KNOW I MEAN HE WENT
YEAH HE WENT EVERYWHERE HE WANTED TO GO
NO AND THEN UH ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO HE UH HE STARTED HAVING MINI STROKES
AND WE GOT KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT HIM AND THEN UH HE HAD FALLEN IN THE STREET A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT
HE UH
HE STILL DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP HIS APARTMENT
AND UH
FINALLY A YEAR AGO LAST THANKSGIVING UM MY WIFE TRIED TO CALL HIM AND HE WOULDN'T ANSWER THE PHONE SO WE KIND OF EXPECTED THE WORSE SO I WENT DOWN
AND HE HAD HAD ANOTHER STROKE AND UH I FOUND HIM HE WAS JUST HE WAS JUST STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ALL COVERED WITH SHAVING CREAM HE ALWAYS TRYING TO SHAVE AND UH HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS UH SO WE BROUGHT HIM UP TO TO UH STAY WITH US
AND UH HE S- HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT
HE UH
HE WAS PROBABLY UH
SAY NINETY FIVE PERCENT HIMSELF
AND IN IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT  DURING THE NEXT YEAR TOWARDS AGAIN IT WAS GETTING ON TOWARDS THANKSGIVING TIME HE STARTED HAVING YOU KNOW MORE STROKES AND THEN UH
UH ONE MORNING HE FELT REAL DIZZY SO WE TOOK HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
AND WHILE HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HE HAD A A MASSIVE STROKE
AND IT CRIPPLED HIM
ON ONE SIDE HIS RIGHT SIDE
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE THE USE OF OF HIS ARM OR HIS LEG OR AND THEN UH HE LOST THE ABILITY TO SPEAK
AND WE'RE NOT SURE BUT WE THINK THAT HE WAS
VERY HARD OF HEARING TO BEGIN WITH HIS ALMOST HIS WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE
SO WE FIGURED THAT UH HIS HEARING DETERIORATED EVEN FURTHER AND HIS EYESIGHT
UM WE DID AS AS MUCH AS WE COULD FOR HIM AND THEN IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULDN'T HANDLE HIM ANYMORE
UM I WAS WORKING DURING THE DAY AND AND UH
UH MY WIFE COULDN'T SHE SHE COULDN'T GET HIM UP
SO UM
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS TO PUT HIM BACK IN THE HOSPITAL WHICH WE DID AND THEY TOOK CARE OF HIM YOU KNOW AND HE SLOWLY DETERIORATED AND UH
TO THE POINT WHERE HE UH BECAME FAIRLY STABLE I MEAN HE HE KNEW WHO WE WERE WHEN WE WENT IN TO VISIT HIM  EVEN THOUGH HE COULDN'T COMMUNICATE WITH US
AND THEN THEY SAID THAT UM THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THAT THEY COULD DO FOR HIM AND HE HAD TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME THE DOCTOR SAID THAT HE COULDN'T COME BACK WITH US
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM
AND WE STARTED LOOKING AROUND AND THEY SAID NO THE FIRST NURSING HOME THAT'S CLOSEST TO YOU THAT HAS AN AVAILABLE BED IS WHERE HE'S GOING TO GO
SO WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE
WELL AT LEAST UP HERE UM SO HE WENT IN THERE ANYHOW AND MY WIFE WENT IN THERE EVERY DAY TO SEE HIM AND YOU KNOW SHE
UH AT FIRST W- AT FIRST NO
WELL IT'S A BUSINESS
YOU GET THEM IN UH YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR THEM AND THAT'S IT
UM SO I WOULD GO ON WEEKENDS AND SHE WOULD GO DURING THE DAY TO TO VISIT HIM AND THEY HAD A LAUNDRY YOU KNOW THEY HAD THE WHOLE FACILITY WAS THERE BUT
CLOSED UP MOST OF THE TIME SO SHE'D GO IN AND SHE'D DO HIS LAUNDRY FOR HIM AND SHE'D GO IN AND FEED HIM AND
AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE UM THEY WE KNEW THEM JUST AS MUCH AS THEY KNEW US AND AND THEY REALLY CARED FOR HIM AT YOU KNOW HE WAS IN THERE FOR ALMOST SIX MONTHS
WITH THE NURSING HOME RIGHT UM AND IT WAS RUN THE NURSING HOME WAS RUN BY UH
REGULAR STAFF BUT IT WAS OWNED BY SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS
WHICH WAS A SURPRISE TO US YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEY HAD I GUESS
UH BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE
WELL THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT THEY OWNED IT
BUT THEY
I SUPPOSE THEY CARED HOW IT WAS RUN BUT THEY HAD AN ADMINISTRATOR THAT RAN IT AND AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE UM
UH ALIENS YOU KNOW UH JAMAICANS OR AFRICANS OR
AND THEY UH THEY TOOK REAL GOOD CARE OF HIM THEY UH HE HAD LOST A PAIR OF SLIPPERS UH ONE DAY AND ONE OF THEM OUT OF HER OWN MONEY BOUGHT A  PAIR OF SLIPPERS FOR HIM AND YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF THING
BUT I THINK ONLY BECAUSE MY WIFE SPENT SO MUCH TIME THERE SHE WAS THERE I MEAN EVERY SINGLE DAY DURING THE WEEK AND THEN ON WEEKENDS WE WOULD GO IN THE BOTH OF US
AND SHE WOULD DO THINGS AND SHE WOULD DONATE LITTLE THINGS AND SHE'D HELP CLEAN UP THE TABLES AND YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF THING SO UM
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN MOST WHEN MOST PEOPLE END UP IN THERE AND I HEAR IT FROM A LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE THEIR GREATEST FEAR IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO END UP THERE AND NOBODY'S GOING TO SEE THEM
THEY'LL BE ABUSED BUT YOU HEAR HORROR STORIES ALL THE TIME
BUT IF YOU CARE
THEN IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE THOSE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE UH A A LOT OF VISITORS
AND WE HAD A GENTLEMAN THAT UH THAT UH
LET'S SEE MAYBE ABOUT A WEEK AFTER MY FATHER-IN-LAW WAS IN THERE HE SHARED HIS ROOM HE CAME IN HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL UH HE HE AGAIN HAD A HAD A STROKE AND HE WAS PARTIALLY PARALYZED
BUT HE WAS YOUNG ENOUGH WHERE THEY GAVE HIM THERAPY AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO MOVE UP BUT HE COULD TALK AND
YEAH YEAH IN FACT UH
WE GO DOWN TO SEE HIM SHE GOES DOWN OCCASIONALLY MAYBE MAYBE UH ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK J- JUST TO SEE HIM
AND UH I'LL STOP IN MAYBE ONCE OR ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH ON THE WEEKEND I'LL GO DOWN TO SEE HIM
UH YES BUT HE GETS OUT HE CAN GET OUT YOU KNOW HE CAN UH HE'S GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS AND THEY TAKE HIM HERE AND THEY TAKE HIM THERE SO HE'S NOT AS AS BAD OFF AS SOME OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE IN THERE AND IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT MY FATHER-IN-LAW WAS IN THERE
UM I'VE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THEM THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY VISITORS WHATSOEVER AT LEAST WHILE I WAS THERE
YEAH THEY JUST UH
YEAH AND UH WE HAD AN OLD DOG AN OLD SHEPHERD UH THEY WERE INSEPARABLE MY FATHER-IN-LAW AND THE DOG WE BROUGHT THE DOG DOWN THERE AND IT WAS NICE AND ALL THE OLD PEOPLE OH LOOK AT THE DOG AND
WELL MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T UH THEY DON'T THEY FI- FIGURE ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE YOU FORGET EVERYTHING AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY NOT THE CASE AND IT'S IT'S SAD UM
I HOPE THAT I NEVER GET INTO THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW THE KIDS WILL SAY WELL OKAY DAD YOU KNOW HERE YOU GO
I THINK I'LL WALK OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS SOMEWHERE OR OUT INTO THE
BUT YEAH YEAH AND YOU KNOW AND THERE'S SOMETHING TO SAY FOR THAT I THINK
RIGHT THEY DO AND AND THE PEOPLE THAT
THAT HAVE FAMILIES THAT DON'T
WELL
I WOULD I HATE TO SEE THEM BEING PUT INTO A A HAIR CA- OR A HEALTH FACILITY CARE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY THEN FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THE FAMILY HAS ABANDONED THEM
IS UH WHAT I GET THE COMMENTS FROM ELDERLY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENED TO
AND THE ELDERLY PEOPLE THAT I  THAT ARE STILL HANGING ONTO THEIR HOMES THAT IS THEIR GREATEST FEAR IS TO BE PUT INTO A A A CARE FACILITY RATHER THAN THEIR FAMILIES TAKING THEM IN
BECAUSE THE FAMILIES THEN SEEM TO NEGLECT VISITING THEM
BUT IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO A CARE FACILITY LIKE THAT I THINK THAT CARE FACILITY HAS TO BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AS FAR AS THE UH MEDICAL UM
EVALUATION WHAT KIND OF CREDENTIALS DO THE MEDICAL PEOPLE HOLD UH IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED UH WHAT TYPE OF RECREATION DO THEY HAVE FOR THEM UH THEIR FOOD UH SITUATION
UM
THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT THEY'RE THERE IS IT BRIGHT AND CHEERY UM
AND TO PUT THEM IN WITH PEOPLE THAT
HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF UH LIFESTYLE UH THAT THEY WOULD FEEL M- MORE WELCOME IN UH
IN MAKING NEW FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY CAN RELATE TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR PERSONALITIES
UM
SO I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT NOW RAY

AND I OF COURSE I WAS LISTENING TO ROCK MUSIC WHA- WHAT I CALLED ROCK MUSIC WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER  NOW THE MUSIC IS SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I USED TO LISTEN TO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I C- COULD CONSIDER IT THE SAME BUT
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH WELL
MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BOTH THAT WAY WE WE BOTH REALLY LIKE THE BEATLES A LOT AND UM
OH REALLY
THAT'S FUNNY WELL I'M PROBABLY OLDER THAN YOU THEN  BUT BUT I UH I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE BEATLES WERE GREAT AND

UM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S GOOD
YEAH I LIKE WILLIE NELSON TOO
YEAH WELL SEE I THE THE REASON I SAID MY TASTE IS PROBABLY DIFFERENT IS I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED COUNTRY MUSIC AND MY HUSBAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN JUST TOTAL ROCK
AND SO UH WE NEVER COULD AGREE ON WHAT WE WERE GOING TO LISTEN TO AFTER WE GOT MARRIED BECAUSE I'D WANT TO L- HEAR COUNTRY AND HE'D WANT TO HEAR ROCK AND WE COULDN'T GET ALONG BECAUSE HIS ROCK WAS TOO ROCK FOR ME I LIKE SOFT ROCK BUT I DON'T LIKE SOME OF THE HEAVY METAL STUFF HE WAS LISTENING TO
AND UM
SO BOTH OF US WERE REAL STRONG MEMBERS OF A CHURCH AND UH WE DECIDED WE START LISTENING TO CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC SO WE STARTED LISTENING TO ONE OF THE STATIONS AROUND HERE THAT WE BOTH REALLY LIKE IT PLAYS JUST CHRISTIAN MUSIC ALL THE TIME
AND WE'VE GOTTEN NOW WHERE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL WE LISTEN TO AND UH THERE'RE SOME REALLY REALLY TALENTED ARTISTS THAT'S YOU KNOW SONG WRITERS AND SINGERS THAT UH DO JUST CHRISTIAN MUSIC
SO OF COURSE YOU KNOW AMY GRANT AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN THERE'S A GUY NAMED  BRUCE CARROLL AND HE'S MY FAVORITE BECAUSE HE HAS A COUNTRY SOUND BUT IT'S CHRISTIAN LYRICS
AND HE'S A WONDERFUL SONG WRITER HE WON A AN AN IS IT EMMY OR WHAT DOES IT GRAMMY IT'S THE GRAMMY AWARDS THEY GIVE FOR MUSIC YEAH HE WON A GRAMMY FOR INSPIRATIONAL SONG OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR SO
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL THAT'S NEAT
OH SANDY PATTY AND YEAH WELL THAT'S PRETTY NEAT WELL SEE I'M EXCITED THAT KIDS THESE DAYS ARE LIKING DECENT MUSIC AND UH
I MEAN ALL THE SONGS OF OF COURSE ON ON THIS STATION HAVE REAL GOOD GOOD LYRICS AND GOOD IDEAS AND THAT KIND OF THING SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE MY DAUGHTER TO LISTEN TO THAT AND SHE RIGHT NOW SHE LOVES IT I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'LL STICK WITH HER SHE'S STILL YOUNG IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THAT SHE STILL CHOOSES THAT BUT YOU KNOW I LIKE THE COUNTRY SOUND THERE ARE SE- I LI- I LIKE WILLIE NELSON I ALWAYS LIKE DON WILLIAMS MY DAD THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY BUT
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND UM THEN MY HUSBAND ON THE OTHER HAND HE I GUESS WHEN HE WAS LIKE IN HIS EARLY TWENTIES REALLY GOT INTO THE HEAVY METAL KIND OF STUFF BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED AND
SO THEN HE'D WANT TO PLAY THAT STUFF AND I WAS LIKE OH THAT'S GIVING ME A HEADACHE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S RI-
YEAH
YEAH YEAH WELL I STILL WHENEVER THEY UM HAVE THESE ADVERTISEMENTS ON TV FOR UM RECORDS THAT HAVE LIKE ALL THE SONGS FROM THE SEVENTIES I WAS I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL LIKE FROM THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND UH
SO ALL THAT MUSIC BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES YOU KNOW AND I'M ALWAYS THINKING OH I'D LIKE TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS BUT SINCE WE MADE THIS AGREEMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO CHRISTIAN MUSIC I THINK OH WELL I'LL PROBABLY SET IT ON THE SHELF AND  WOULD NEVER YOU KNOW PLAY IT
YEAH  THAT'S RIGHT WE BUY THINGS THAT WE KNOW THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN LISTEN TO
UH-HUH
OH THAT'S NEAT
UH-HUH
OH THAT'S GOOD YEAH
YEAH WELL SEE I'M AN INTERESTING PERSON BECAUSE I GO TO THE CHURCH OF CHRIST AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE AT CHURCH OF CHRIST THAT THINK UH
THAT'S RIGHT AND AND I THINK MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THEY'RE MISSING OUT ON A LOT AND I LOVE UM THIS YOU KNOW THAT KLTY THAT'S WHAT I LISTEN TO ALL THE TIME AND I
I LOVE ALL THE MUSIC THAT THEY PLAY ON THERE BUT I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO TO CHURCH WITH ME THAT KIND OF CRITICIZE THAT AND THINK THAT UH IT'S WRONG AND ALL THIS SO UH I-
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WELL I TOLD MY HUSBAND THE ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT IT IS UH YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF THINK ABOUT WHATEVER YOU LISTEN TO I MEAN YOU JUST YOU MAY NOT REALIZE YOU'RE DOING IT BUT YOU DO AND UH WHEN I LISTEN TO CHRISTIAN MUSIC THEN I'M LIS- I'M THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING GOOD YOU KNOW AND
WHAT WOULD YOU SERVE AT A DINNER PARTY
OKAY
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YEAH
OURS WOULD LEAN MORE TOWARD UH I GUESS MONETARY CONCERNS RATHER THAN THE FORMALITY OF THE DEAL IF IF WE WERE HAVING A BUNCH OF FRIENDS OVER IF THERE WERE SIX TO TEN COMING OVER WE'D END UP SERVING ANYTHING WITH CHICKEN DUE DUE TO ITS CHEAPNESS
AND UH  OH YOU CAN RUN A A A REGULAR SPAGHETTI OR EVEN A CHICKEN SPAGHETTI TYPE CASSEROLES ANYTHING THAT THAT CAN BE SPREAD OVER A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR A FEW NUMBER OF DOLLARS
AND UH  OH IF IT'S SMALLER AND AND FOR A GIVEN OCCASION MY WIFE WILL WILL END UP COOKING A VARIETY OF OF UH SHALL I SAY MORE FANCY FOODS AS IT WERE BUT
I GREW UP IN A  IN A FAMILY THAT THAT HAD A A FEW FORMAL THINGS BUT UH
MY MOTHER WAS DEAF AND AND HUNG AROUND THE HOUSE A LOT SO SHE DEVELOPED A UH A COOKING HABIT THAT WAS JUST UNMATCHED BY MOST OF HER PEERS AND WE ATE SOME VERY
GOOD FOOD AND THEN LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT AND EVEN TO THIS DAY WITH THE TWO OF THEM UH RETIRED AND AND NONE OF THE KIDS AT HOME AND
THEY STILL KEEP A LARGE REFRIGERATOR TOTALLY FULL I- I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE I MEAN EVEN OUR REFRIGERATOR WITH A FAMILY OF FOUR DOES NOT HAVE THE FOOD CONTENT THAT THEY MANAGE TO DO  SO SHE STILL LIKES TO TO COOK A LARGE UH VARIETY OF FOODS UM
MY WIFE ON THE OTHER HAND COMES OUT OF THE MILITARY TYPE FAMILY AND AND THEY WERE ALWAYS ON THE GO AND THEY NEVER REALLY HAD A A FORMAL SETTING AS IT WERE AND SO SHE TENDS TO COOK A LITTLE MORE UH
INFORMAL TYPE THINGS AND WHEN WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER IT'S USUALLY JUST FOR A UH A LIGHT
PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE WOULD EAT ANYWAY A LIGHT INFORMAL MEAL AND THEY USUALLY BRING SOMETHING A DESERT OR A SALAD OR WHATEVER AND UH
I DO LIKE THE UH  INSTEAD OF THE
FAMILY YOU KNOW SO SO WE DO GET SOME WEIRD CONCOCTIONS ON OCCASION THAT SHE'LL SHE'LL EXPERIMENT ON THINGS SHE HAS A REAL UH NICE REPERTOIRE OF UH DESSERTS AND UH
I LIKE TO LIKE TO EAT DESSERTS
HM
HM INTERESTING
YEAH
HM
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S IN- THAT'S AN INTERESTING DISCIPLINE I HAVEN'T UH I- I PROBABLY SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT I- I NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT UH IT DOES SEEM TO BE A BIT OF A CHANGE IN WHAT I'VE BEEN SERVED AT DIFFERENT HOUSES OVER THE YEARS UH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH HM
AND JUST AS EDIBLE  VERY BALANCED VERY GOOD YES YES
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD DEAL
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YEAH POPCORN HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE THE MOST FILLING AND LEAST UH YOU KNOW BAD FOR YOU AS IT WERE AND IT SEEMS TO BE GOOD IN ALL THOSE CATEGORIES THAT THEY'RE RATING THESE DAYS
FEW CALORIES AND FEW WELL IF YOU DON'T DRENCH IT IN BUTTER I GUESS
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
PURE OATS
HM
INTERESTING
UH-HUH
HUH
YEAH
I'LL SAY
YEAH IT'S BEEN A COUPLE YEARS WE GOT RID OF OUR DEEP FRYER WE USED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BITTY BABY FRYERS AND WE'D UH DO EVERYTHING FROM UH
FONDUES TO  SOME OTHER LITTLE UH MEATS EVEN THE UH FRENCH BREAD WE USED TO ACTUALLY DO IN IN UH FRENCH TOAST AS IT WERE IN THE OILS BUT UH NOW IT'S JUST MORE LIKE A GRILLED PIECE OF UH
BREAD A A THAT'S INTERESTING I HADN'T I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED I GUESS THE WHATEVER ENTITY IS MOVING US TOWARD HEALTHY FOODS IS DOING WELL THE WHOLE NATION SEEMS TO BE MOVING SLOWLY THAT WAY
WELL THAT WOULD HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE UH NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE NATURE OF THE PARTY FAIRLY SMALL PARTIES WITH PEOPLE THAT I KNOW I TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CASUAL AND I WOULD TEND TO
TO UH SERVE THINGS THAT WERE BUFFET STYLE PERHAPS WE'D HAVE UH
OH I LIKE THOSE LITTLE LITTLE COCKTAIL SAUSAGES IN BARBECUE SAUCE OR OR MAYBE A SAUSAGE BALL UH CRACKERS AND DIPS CHIPS MAYBE UH
PROBABLY HAVE SOME KIND OF A OF A SALAD UH THAT'S EASY TO PICK UP AND SPREAD
FRESH VEGGIES PROBABLY UH POSSIBLY UH BLOCKS OF CHEESE AND CHUNKS OF UH DELI MEAT
HAVE TO INCLUDE SOME FRUIT OF SOME KIND I PREFER BERRIES UH LIKE SUGARED GRAPES AND THINGS THAT ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO SET OUT ON A ON A TABLE
A LITTLE BIT MORE FORMAL DINNER PARTY YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE FORMAL SETTING I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FORMAL DINNER PARTIES SO I CAN'T TELL YOU A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THAT
BUT I TEND TO BE VERY LAZY AND WANT TO DO WHAT IS EASY BUT LOOKS AND TASTES GOOD SO
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WELL
IN RECENT YEARS I HAVE BECOME FAR MORE CONSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUS OF BALANCING THE DIET AND HAVING HEALTHY FOODS IF I WERE HAVING PEOPLE OVER I WOULD WANT
HEALTHY FOOD TO BE ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS MOST OF MY FRIENDS REALLY WOULD PREFER A BOWL OF FRUIT AS OPPOSED TO A BIG GOOEY CAKE
UH THEY WOULD PREFER FRESH STICK VEGGIES AS OPPOSED TO CHIPS AND DIPS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME HARD CRUST CHIPS AND DIPPERS UH
AND I I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF NUTRITION CONTENT IN THE FOODS I'LL BE CAREFUL BUT FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE KIND OF CRACKER THAT I PICK TO GO UNDER A SPREAD
I MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CALORIES THAT ARE GOING INTO THE SPREAD I KNOW I WATCH MY WEIGHT AND I'M SURE THAT MOST OF MY FRIENDS DO TOO AND I APPRECIATE SOMEBODY BEING CONSCIOUS OF THAT WHEN I GO VISIT
SO I DO TRY TO COOK MORE HEALTHY THAN I DID EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO I LET MY PALATE DICTATE UH NOW I'M MORE CONSCIOUS ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
ABOUT THE KIND OF FOOD UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
WELL THERE WAS A TIME FOR EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD'VE MADE A BIG GOOEY CREAMY PIE FOR DESSERT NOW NOW I MAY USE AN ANGEL FOOD CAKE WITH FRUIT AND A LIGHT WHIPPED TOPPING
FAR FEWER CALORIES AND FAR LESS CHOLESTEROL UH
UH-HUH UH-HUH AND JUST AS PALATABLE I LOVE PEACHES AND STRAWBERRIES AND I SURE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN SEASON
AND UH AS FAR AS THE THE PARTY SNACKS UH I MAY FIX A TRAIL MIX OR A CARAMEL POPCORN FOR SNACKING AS OPPOSED TO WHAT PURE PEANUTS
YEAH OR OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT REALLY IS LOADED WITH EMPTY NUTRI- WITH EMPTY CALORIES NO NUTRITION
OH YEAH IT'S A FAVORITE UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH YEAH UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT
UH-HUH WELL I TEND TO I- I  NEARLY EVERYTHING I TRY TO BALANCE UH YOU CAN TAKE EVERYTHING TO AN EXTREME
EVERYTHING TO AN EXTREME AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE FLAVOR AND THE PLEASURE OUT OF THE FOOD IN ORDER TO MAKE IT QUOTE HEALTHY I'D RATHER DIE THAN EAT TERRIBLE TASTING FOOD
YEAH YEAH AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW YOU
PEOPLE WHOSE SYSTEMS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE CAN ACTUALLY TOLERATE IT MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT I KNOW THAT WHEN I BEGAN TO ADD BRAN TO MY DIET I HAD TERRIBLE BELLYACHE  UNTIL I UNTIL MY SYSTEM BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO IT
AND UH BY THE SAME TOKEN WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I FIRST MARRIED HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO A A GREASY DIET LOTS OF FRIED FOODS AND I NEARLY DIED THEN  BECAUSE I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FRESH VEGETABLES AND BAKED MEATS
OR BROILED MEATS OR GRILLED MEATS I PREFER MY MEAT GRILLED TO FRIED ANYTIME I MAY DO A LITTLE STIR FRY OR A LITTLE WOK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I DO NOT FRY MY FOODS THAT MUCH ANYMORE USED TO BUT I DON'T ANYMORE
TWO REASONS ONE IT'S JUST NOT THAT HEALTHY AND IT MAKES MY STOMACH UPSET SECOND IT'S A BIG MESS TO CLEAN UP  I'M NOT INTERESTED IN CLEANING UP A MESS
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
UH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WELL OF COURSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT WE'VE DONE SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND OUR BODY IS GOING TO
ARE YOU READY
SHE DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THAT TO YOU
OH I SEE THAT'S FINE UM I THINK UH THAT'S PLEASURABLE FOR ALL OF US  CHOOSE THE RIGHT RESTAURANT
SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON DINING OUT
NOT FOR THE PRICE

WHAT ABOUT FAST FOODS DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE IF YOU WERE GOING TO EAT A FAST FOOD
YOU DO LIKE ARBY'S SEE I DON'T LIKE ARBY'S
NO BECAUSE THEY USE EVERYTHING THEY CAN AND MAKE THIS INTO PRESSED WHATEVER THEY USE THE THEY USE THE INSIDES OF THE ANIMALS HEART AND LIVER AND THEY THEY FORM IT AND THEY MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ROAST BEEF AND I SAID NO THANK YOU
WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD FROM ONE OF SOMEBODY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
UH-HUH
REALLY
UNLESS SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO BLACKBALL THEM
UM-HUM

HOW ABOUT THE HEALTH FOOD UH RESTAURANTS
WELL LIKE THIS ONE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT ADVERTISED AS SUCH IS IT
OR
UH-HUH HEALTH FOOD UH RESTAURANTS THAT
WELL
WELL LIKE UM
WELL I CAN'T REALLY THINK OF ANY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE'S SO FEW AND FAR BETWEEN BUT THEY OUGHT THERE ARE RESTAURANTS THAT CATER TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY HEALTH CONSCIOUS
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THEIR CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AND THEIR THEIR FAT CONTENT AND YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM AND SO FORTH THAT ARE IN EACH PRODUCT AND THEY LIST THEM NOW THERE'S ONE RESTAURANT THAT DOES THAT AND IT'S CALLED RODOLFO'S OVER ON
PRESTON ROAD AND ROYAL LANE I BELIEVE AND THEY  HAVE VERY GOOD FOOD OVER THERE
UH-HUH UH-HUH THEY DO LIST UM YOU KNOW LIST THE FAT
UH-HUH UH-HUH
WELL IT WAS PRETTY REASONABLE I IT WAS AROUND TEN DOLLARS FOR LUNCH
OKAY WHI- WHICH IS KIND OF HIGH FOR LUNCH I GUESS
YES
YES UH-HUH YEAH
UH BUT UM
YOU WERE SERVED BY MAITRE D'S AND AND UH UM
MEN WAITERS
WELL IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NICE
UH-HUM WELL I GUESS IF YOU WERE HAVING IF YOU WERE TRYING TO IMPRESS SOMEBODY LIKE TAKING SOMEBODY THAT YOU HADN'T SEEN FOR A LONG TIME AND WANTED TO SHOW THEM A GOOD RESTAURANT IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION TYPE THING YEAH
UH-HUM
AND NOW THE RED LOBSTER I FOUND IS VERY NICE AT LUNCHTIME
BECAUSE THEY'RE
WELL THEY HAVE LUNCH SPECIALS THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT PRICE UH IF YOU WENT TO A CAFETERIA
WELL I HAD THE I HAD A BROILED CHICKEN BREAST AND IT WAS EXCELLENT
IT WAS A MARINATED BROILED CHICKEN BREAST AND IT WAS EXC-
OH IT WAS
WELL I'VE NEVER HAD CATFISH EITHER IN A
RESTAURANT BECAUSE I'M FROM THE NORTH AND THAT WAS A NO NO AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN OVER THAT FROM THE NORTH
I KNOW THEY SAY THAT THAT IS BUT I'M
BUT THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE CAUTION SIGNS NOW ON FISH
AND SO I KIND OF STAY A- BECAUSE OF ALL THE POLLUTION IN THE LAKES AND THE
EVERYWHERE I MEAN THERE ISN'T ANY SAFE HAVEN ANYMORE FOR FISH
I- AND ESPECIALLY UH IN WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN THEY SAY DON- BUYING OF OUR FISH
I
WELL
YEAH SO YOU I
AND THE THE BEST BRAND OF CHICKEN TO BUY IS THE UH
PILGRIM PRIDE BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE ALL THESE HORMONES TO PROMOTE UH UNNATURAL GROWTH IN THEIR PRODUCTS
SO I MEAN WE HAVE TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT IF WE WANT TO STAY HEALTHY
SO I'M I YOU KNOW I
UM-HUM
YEAH
CORRODE
HUM
UM-HUM
WELL I'D LIKE TO GET AHOLD OF SOME ENGINEERS AND KNOCK THEIR HEADS TOGETHER IF IT WOULD DO ANY GOOD
OH DEAR
WOW
SURE YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT EVERYTHING WE EAT EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING WE EAT SHOULD HAVE A LABEL ON IT  YEAH
WELL YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH I DIDN'T I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR ALL OF IT
RIGHT
WELL I I REALLY CHOOSE RESTAURANTS MORE FOR THE QUALITY OF FOOD THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WELL A LITTLE BIT FOR THE PRICE BUT UH I THINK THAT AS FAR AS QUALITY OF FOOD GOES THE M- SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLACES I'VE BEEN HAD THE THE REALLY THE THE WORST QUALITY OF FOOD
REALLY UM A LOT OF PLACES THAT EVEN DON'T LOOK DON'T LOOK LIKE MUCH SOME OF THE SOME OF THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD WAS OUT OF A OUTSIDE OR INSIDE OF A PLACE THAT WE DROVE UP AND I WAS LIKE
I'M NOT EATING IN THERE  ARE YOU NUTS AND UH WE WENT IN AND IT WAS THE M- IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL FOOD
YEAH I'M SERIOUS
UM A LOT OF
UH ONE PLACE THAT WE WENT JUST RECENTLY UH WAS TO ATCHAFALAYA NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT THAT'S NOT RIGHT THAT'S NOT RIGHT WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT RESTAURANT
THE HARI KRISHNA
KALACHANDJI'S IT'S ALL VEGETARIAN AND IT WAS JUST FABULOUS I MEAN MY HUSBAND WAS AGHAST BECAUSE I ATE TURNIP GREENS AND LIKED IT
UM KALACHANDJI'S IT'S UH IT'S A HARI KRISHNA RUN RESTAURANT
YES
UH I THINK SO IT SHOULD BE
UH IT STARTS WITH A K
SO
K A L A I THINK C H A N D
THAT SHOULD GET YOU CLOSE ENOUGH TO
TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT I THINK IT'S UH PROBABLY LISTED IN THE RESTAURANTS YOU KNOW
BUT IT'S UH IT'S JUST FABULOUS FOOD
WELL WE LIKE ARBY'S
AS FAR AS FAST FOOD GOES OH REALLY WHY
OH NO NO NO SOMEONE HAS BEEN LYING TO YOU WHAT THEY USE IS ROAST BEEF
THAT'S WHAT
OH MY GOODNESS
I'M SURPRISED MY DAD WORKED FOR ARBY'S FOR SEVERAL YEARS
YEAH
WELL THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE BUT WE LIKE GOOD UH W- WE'RE WE LIKE MEXICAN FOOD
AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO UM
A HEALTH FOOD
LIKE LIKE NAME ONE  I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
HUM
I DON'T GUESS I'VE EVER BEEN TO ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPARE IT TO
IT WOULD BE GOOD I THINK UH I DON'T KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE THEY ARE IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY
FOR ONE PERSON
OH
A BIT
SEE I I WON'T REALLY BE INTERESTED IN GOING TO GOING THERE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M I'M PAYING YOU KNOW FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE FOOD PROBABLY AND FIVE DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING THAT I COULD GET ALONG QUITE WELL WITHOUT
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE THAT YEAH
YEAH I COULD SEE THAT THEN MAYBE
YEAH I LIKE THE THE SEAFOOD THAT THEY WHEN THEY HAD IT YOU KNOW THE BROILED
YEAH PROBABLY THAT'S TRUE BUT I KNOW A LOT OF THEIR A LOT OF THEIR SPECIALS SOMETIMES ARE FRIED THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY GET AWAY FROM THE FRIED
NOW WHY WOULD YOU GO TO A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT TO EAT CHICKEN THAT'S ONE OF MY HUSBAND'S PET PEEVES HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEBODY WOULD GO TO A SEAFOOD PLACE AND EAT EITHER CHICKEN OR STEAK YOU KNOW
OH REALLY
OH CATFISH IS WONDERFUL OH REALLY
REALLY
WHY
OH
HUM
THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO STOP EATING IT
UH-HUH YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
OH ON ONE HAND I SEE THAT AND ON THE OTHER HAND UH MY OLDER SISTER
REMEMBERS WHEN UH AT ONE POINT THEY WERE TAKING RADIOACTIVE WASTES
AND STORING THEM IN TIN BARRELS WHICH I- I GUESS HAD A HALF-LIFE OF OH FIVE YEARS IF THEY SIT EMPTY ON DRY LAND
SO THEY'RE PUTTING RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN IT WHICH REDUCES IT DRAMATICALLY AND THEN THEY TAKE THESE THINGS THAT WILL RUST AND THEY THROW THEM IN THE OCEAN WHICH IS GOING TO SPEEDUP THE PROCESS EVEN MORE
OH AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T SINK THEY WERE FLOATING AROUND SO THEY SHOT HOLES IN THEM TO SINK THEM AND THIS IS BEFORE I WAS BORN
SO I MEAN WE'RE TAKING THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED AND
AND WHO'S YOU KNOW THE TUNA IS RADIOACTIVE
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT SO I THINK

TERRIFIC JOB BACK THERE I MEAN YOU KNOW Y- YOU PAY FOR IT TOO BUT IT'S IT'S LIKE REALLY WORTH IT THEY ARE PUTTING IN A DECK A REDWOOD DECK AND IT'S JUST
THEY ARE DOING SUCH A FINE FINE JOB AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT
UH-HUH
GREAT
YEAH
OH
LOOKS LIKE THE GEORGE TOWN BROWNSTONE YEAH
MUST BE A DREAM COME TRUE YEAH
I CAN'T
HE HAS NO INSULATION PROBABLY
OH MY GOSH WHAT A TRAP
AND YOU ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND CAN RESEARCH YEAH
YEAH
OH I DO TOO
BUT STILL UM IT'S WORTH IT FOR THE AREA AND FOR THE SCHOOL  THINGS LIKE THAT
THERE YOU GO FIRST QUESTION DO YOU OWN YOUR HOUSE
OUR NAME IS ON THE BILL SO THAT IMPLIES OWNERSHIP
THAT'S RIGHT AND I WOULDN'T OBJECT IF ANYBODY DID
YEAH WELL WE'VE WE HAD THIS ONE FOR FIVE YEARS NOW BEFORE THAT WE LIVED IN GARLAND UH
PROBABLY ABOUT YOU KNOW FOUR BLOCKS AWAY LIKED THE AREA CHOSE TO STAY INSIDE OF SPRING PARK IT'S A UH
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN UP HERE BUT IT IS A RESIDENTIAL HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION SO THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW ACTIVITIES A LOT OF PLUSES AND COMMON LAND
BUT UH WE THOUGHT WE WERE BUYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET YOU KNOW IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE GONE ANY LOWER AND SO WE WERE WRONG
YEAH
I THINK WHAT IT BOTTOM OUT ABOUT A YE- YEAR LATER
ODDLY ENOUGH TWO YEARS YOU KNOW I- I THINK THAT
NOT IN IN IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT LIKE THE
YEAH
NO IT'S IT'S RICHARDSON IT'S UH RICHARDSON AND HOLD ON A SECOND PAUL I CAN HEAR YOU PERFECTLY PERFECTLY WELL I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU YOU ARE BEING RUDE WHATEVER YOU ASK OR SCREAM WHEN I'M ON THE PHONE THE ANSWER IS NO DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW DOES THAT SOUND
YEAH THERE I GO YEAH YEAH WELL I HATE TO SAY HOW LONG THAT WILL LAST TOO NO THIS AREA UP HERE IS UH  ALL CUSTOM HOMES AND IT'S
I- I DON'T THINK THAT MANY BY THE BUILDER THAT WE THAT BUILT THIS HOUSE AND WE WERE NOT THE FIRST PEOPLE THE FIRST OWNERS I THINK WE ARE THE THIRD OWNERS IT WAS BUILT BY THE ARCHITECT FOR HIMSELF
WHO NEVER MOVED INTO IT WHO SOLD IT TO A COUPLE WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT HOMES EVER NEEDED UPKEEP
OH YEAH CAULKING WINDOWS WAS A GREAT MYSTERY TO THEM YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THEY JUST WATCHED THE WATER POUR IN ON THE CARPET BUT IT'S A SHARIF MYNEER HOMES IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING IT DID NOT REALLY MEAN ANYTHING TO ME EXCEPT I LIKED IT
HE BUILDS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSES NOW I THINK HE GOT OUT OF THE LOWER END MARKET AND DECIDED BUT THE HOUSES HERE IN IN THIS CLASS OF HOUSING NEVER DROPPED TO BELOW TWO HUNDRED
YEAH WELL  STILL I KNOW THAT THIS ONE WAS BUILT FOR TWO NINETY NINE WHICH IS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT WE PAID FOR IT AND I THINK OR SOMEBODY TOLD ME IT'S ALSO ON A CREEK SIDE LOT HEAVILY WOODED OFF THE GOLF COURSE
YEAH AND THE GUY AROUND THE CORNER IS BEING TRANSFERRED SO HE SAID UH WELL HE DID COMPARABLE THAT IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY DOLLARS
I THINK IT WAS
I DON'T REMEMBER IF HE SAID IT WAS SIXTY DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT OFF THE CREEK AND EIGHTY ON THE CREEK OR IF IT WAS EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED I THINK IT WAS SIXTY EIGHTY
I THINK
WELL TRY AND THINK IF IT WAS A HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT
NO IT COULD NOT BE BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS AROUND THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AND IT WOULD NEVER SELL FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST NEVER
NOW MAYBE YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT IT WOULD HAVE SOLD FOR UH BRAND NEW
OR AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT WAS BUILT FOR IT'S GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF NICE THINGS IN IT BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME IF EVER WHEN NICE THINGS AND REALLY QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND ALL THE OTHER ADDITIONAL AMENITIES
ARE REALLY UH
DESIRABLE IT'S SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE GO FOR SQUARE FOOTAGE ONLY NOW
AND UH BECAUSE HAVE YOU BEEN BACK TO THE PERRY HOMES BACK HERE
THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE MONOPOLY APARTMENTS
THEY ARE HUGE WHEN YOU ARE INSIDE THEM THEY'RE VERY SPACIOUS THEY'RE YOU KNOW I WAS I WAS IN ONE TODAY IT WAS FORTY TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET
YEAH UH-HUH
SEE WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEND THEM SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN YELL AND YOU WON'T HEAR THEM BUT I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THESE HOUSES GO UP AND I- I
DON'T WELL SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO LIVES BACK THERE I'VE ALWAYS QUESTIONED THE QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTION AND I- I DON'T THINK THEY EXCEED MORE THAN TWELVE NAILS PER HOUSE
WHEN YOU WATCH THEM GO UP YOU ARE JUST AMAZED THAT THEY DO NOT FALL OVER AND IT TAKES THEM SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY DAYS TO COMPLETE A HOUSE
UM-HUM
WE'VE GOT
THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DECKING BECAUSE THIS LOT SLOPES WAY BACK DOWN AND AND THE HOUSE IS BUILT AROUND THE TREES
AND WITH THESE DECK- DECKING THAT A CORPORATION AND A LARGE AREA FOR THE TREES TO COME UP SO IT'S REAL REAL SHADY BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS
THAT REALLY UH IMMEDIATELY PAYS BACK ON RETURN BUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU THESE PERRY HOMES BACK THERE
WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM MCI COME DOWN AND THEY ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE USED TO THE THE VIRGINIA AREA METROPOLITAN DC MY GOD THEY COME DOWN HERE AND AND THOSE HOUSES THAT THAT LOOK LIKE TO THEM THE COLONIAL LOOK LIKE WHAT THE
RIGHT AND THE IDEA OF EVER OWNING ANYTHING THAT HAS FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IN IT FOR LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT WHAT THEIR EQUITY IS THAT THEY GOT OUT OF SELLING THEIR HOUSE THOSE THINGS ARE SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES
BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS LIVING BACK THERE WAS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS HIS AIR CONDITIONING BILL PER MONTH LAST SUMMER WAS IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND I THOUGHT
AND HE WAS TALKING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU KEEP UP WITH THE UTILITIES HERE AND I WAS THINKING WELL YOU KNOW I KNOW WHY YOUR GOD DAMN BILL IS SO HIGH IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NO INSULATION INSULATION IN THOSE THINGS
YEAH
ANY YET YOU KNOW  THEY THEY SHOW VERY WELL UH THEY SHOW VERY WELL UNLESS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW LIVED IN A LOT OF HOUSES AROUND HERE OR
OR LOOKED AT A LOT OF HOUSES AROUND HERE
AND I THINK THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT I LIKE I LIKE THIS AREA AND EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN SAYING SAYS THAT IT'S
IF I I THINK IF WE HAD TO SELL NOW WE COULD COME CLOSE TO BREAKING EVEN
UH YOU'RE IN YOU'RE IN THE
UH WE ARE TO DISCUSS AIR POLLUTION AND UH WHAT WE THINK THE CAUSES ARE
AND I PROBABLY WOULD UH TARGET UH INDUSTRY AS BEING NUMBER ONE POLLUTER
WELL VEHICLES AND AND YES AND
BUT RIGHT BECAUSE UH THERE'S A LOT OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES OUT THERE ESPECIALLY THOSE THE BIG RIGS LIKE THE BUSSES AND UM
THE BIG UH EIGHTEEN WHEELERS AND SO FORTH
I THINK THEY WOULD GENERATE PROBABLY UH ONE OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY GENERATE ENOUGH FOR THREE CARS
BUT THAT'S NOT AND I THINK IT CAN BE RESOLVED IF UH IF THEY REALLY LET GO WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY HAVE AT UH AT THEIR HAND AND THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED IT YET
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HOLD BACK UH BECAUSE OF UH
OH PRIORITIES THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW AND UM IT'S YOU HAVE SOME CHILDREN
OH OKAY  DO YOU HAVE DO YOU WATCH CHILDREN OR DO YOU
UH-HUH
W- WELL THAT'S INTERESTING
UM
IS THERE ANYTHING
THEN WE GET OUT OF THAT PHASE
SOON ENOUGH
UM
OH YES
UM-HUM
UH-HUH SURE
UM-HUM  WELL I KNOW UH UH IN MICHIGAN UH THE WAY THEY USED TO TAKE CARE OF THE TRASH IS THEY WOULD INCINERATE IT AND THE FUMES FROM THE INCINERATION WAS A TERRIBLE POLLUTANT TO THE AIR
AND UM OF COURSE NOW
NO AND WHEN THEY AND YOU BURY IT AND IT'S NOT GONE EITHER BECAUSE IT HAS UNTOLD RAMIFICATIONS
AND UH
AND IT GETS INTO INTO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHICH IS UH THE THE MOST IMPORTANT UM
RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE IS PEOPLE AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE DESTROYING US THEY REALLY ARE
SO I THINK THE COCKROACH WILL EVOLVE UH S- SAFELY
SO THEY SAY
YES BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
AND WE NEED EXPERT COOPERATION
YEAH EDUCATION OF THE
EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE IS PRIMARY I WOULD THINK
AND UH AND WE'RE HARD TO TEACH
WE ARE HARD TO TEACH
ABSOLUTELY YEAH
UM-HUM
ABSOLUTELY YES UH OF COURSE UH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ACCELERATED BECAUSE UH OF THE CRITICAL NATURE OF IT
THE THE LEARNING OF IT AND THE JUST TO UM THINK THAT WAY WE HAVE TO BE IN THAT THOUGHT PATTERN AND ABLE TO UM MOTIVATE OURSELVES TO UM
UH DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE ATMOSPHERE
UM
I THINK WE'RE ALL CONTRIBUTORS I MEAN EVERY HUMAN BEING THAT LIVES IS A CONTRIBUTOR TO POLLUTION SO
WE JUST UM
UM-HUM
WELL HOPEFULLY IT CAN BE RESOLVED WITHIN A SHORTER TIME FRAME THAN WE HAVE SEEN IT DONE IN THE PAST
THAT THE TIME FRAME FOR CLEANING UP OUR AIR AND OUR AND OUR UM  LAND YOU KNOW WHICH UH WE GET OUR NUTRIENTS FROM YOU KNOW I MEAN EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO THE LAND
SO  UM IT'S JUST UM VERY CRITICAL I THINK AT THIS POINT TO UH GET THAT THROUGH TO THE PEOPLE AND GET US EDUCATED
UM-HUM
I- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY OFFER CLASSES IN UH THE UH IN THE GRADE SCHOOL UH UH SUBJECTING
IN SCIENCE OKAY
WHAT GRADE LEVEL WOULD THAT BE WOULD THAT BE UM
PERHAPS THE FIRST GRADE LEVEL WHICH WOULD BE
WELL I MEAN ARE THEY STARTING THOUGH AT AT WITH THE CHILDREN THAT ARE SO THEIR LITTLE MINDS ARE LIKE SPONGES AND THEY CAN REALLY UH RELATE TO THAT
TARGET STORES
OH OKAY
OKAY
OH I SEE
UM
HELP FIGHT THE POLLUTION OH THAT'S WONDERFUL
WELL I'M SURE THAT UH PERHAPS THEY'RE THE LEADERS YOU KNOW AND OTHER WILL OTHERS WILL PICK UP ON THEIR EXAMPLE AND CARRY IT UM  FURTHER
YOU KNOW BECAUSE UM
THOUGHTS ARE
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY A MAJOR ONE I THINK UH INDIVIDUALLY
UH
JUST BY THE VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE ARE THERE'S I THINK CARS ARE ALSO A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO IT
YEAH VEHICLES
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
JUST A MINUTE I'M ON THE PHONE
UH-HUH
YEAH  WELL IT
YES I HAVE I HAVE FIVE IN THE KITCHEN AT THE MOMENT YOU NEED TO SHUT THE DOOR PLEASE
SHUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW
WE HAVE THE AIR CONDITIONER RUNNING
WHAT DO YOU NEED  HURRY I'M ON THE PHONE
YES YOU MAY AND THEY KEEP TURNING THE TAPE RECORDER UP BESIDES
UM I HAVE THREE OF MY OWN AND I HAVE UH TWO THAT I'M TENDING FOR THE SUMMER OFF AND ON SO
THEY CAUSE MORE NOISE POLLUTION THAN AIR POLLUTION
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YOU CAN TELL WHEN YOU GO AROUND CITIES YOU CAN SMELL SPECIFIC THINGS FROM FROM UH SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES
I REMEMBER BEING I- I GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY
AND UH I CAN REMEMBER THE SMELL OF NEWARK VIVIDLY  AND IT'S THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WHICH OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CAN SMELL IT IT'S IN THE AIR
YEAH
WELL PEOPLE THINK YOU BURN IT IT'S GONE BUT IT'S NOT GONE
UM-HUM
THEN IT JUST GETS INTO THE SOIL AND INTO THE WATER
YEAH
YEAH
WE REALLY HAVE TO DO MORE
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE WITH THE RECYCLING THAT'S I'M I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE'S MORE OF THAT HAPPENING
YEAH
WELL IT'S A WE'RE GETTING AT LEAST THEY'RE STARTING YOU KNOW SO AT LEAST THEY'RE MOVING THAT DIRECTION
YEAH
UM-HUM WELL IT'S GOING TO IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A GENERATION OR TWO BEFORE
BEFORE IT'S REALLY GOING VERY WELL BECAUSE
NOW THE ADULTS ARE MORE AWARE OF IT AND THE CHILDREN ARE BEING TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS MORE
IT'LL BE YOU KNOW ON DOWN THE ROAD THIS IS GOING TO BE PASSED ON WHICH IS GOOD
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT EDUCATION IS A BIG THING YOU KNOW AND AS WE EDUCATE THEM INDIVIDUALLY WHAT THEY CAN DO
PEOPLE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE THINGS IN INDUSTRY TOO THAT THAT ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS AND AND I THINK THAT THEY'LL GRAD- THEY'LL WORK TOWARDS SOLVING THOSE PROBLEMS MORE TOO
UM
UM-HUM
YEAH JUST A MINUTE AND I'LL TURN IT UP I'LL TURN IT UP IN A MINUTE HONEY WHEN I'M DONE
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL I THINK SCIENCE HAS COME A LONG WAY TO MAKING IT
SO THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
UM
I THINK THEY TEACH IT A LOT IN SCIENCE
YEAH I WOULD THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD COME THROUGH
I
I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF GETTING IT IN ALL DIFFERENT GRADES
YEAH
I THINK THEY ARE STARTING PROBABLY IN THE FIRST GRADE THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE HEARING SOMEWHAT ABOUT IT UM
I KNOW UH TARGET HAS THEIR PROGRAM TO MAKE KIDS MORE AWARE OF IT AND
YEAH
THEY'VE GOT IF YOU GO IN THE ENTRANCE THEY'VE GOT UH STANDS USUALLY WHERE THEY HAVE UM
LITTLE UH KIND OF A LITTLE NEWSPAPER THING THAT THE KIDS CAN READ AND AND THEY CAN FORM A A GROUP TO
UH YEAH YEAH
SO
YEAH
WELL I- I KNOW IT'S HAR- IT'S A HARD PROBLEM TO SOLVE BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW LIKE MCDONALD'S HAS CHANGED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PAPER AND FOAM AND THAT KIND OF THING AND
AND THEY DO ALL THESE STUDIES ON WHICH ONES POLLUTE MORE AND THEN THERE'S THE PAPER AND PLASTIC BAG QUESTION
HI PAT
UH-HUH UH-HUH
WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT OUR FAMILIES HAVE CHANGED
SOCIETY HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S WELL
EVEN EVEN RAISING BOYS TODAY IS DIFFERENT THOUGH BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THEY USED TO YOU KNOW USED TO BE THEY WOULD JUST GO OFF TO WORK AND COME HOME AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS DONE AND IT
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD IT'S SOME GOOD SOME BAD UH
IT'S NICE THAT THERE'S A CHOICE I I HAVE CHOSEN TO STAY AT HOME AND RAISE MY CHILDREN AND I HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD AND A TWELVE YEAR OLD
AND I WAS A SINGLE PARENT FOR AWHILE AND WORKED
AND THAT WAS GREAT I WAS ABLE TO AND I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR MY CHILDREN AND AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS WONDERFUL
BUT I UM I THANK GOD EVERYDAY NOW
THAT I HAVE THAT CHOICE AND THAT I AM ABLE TO DO THINGS AT HOME AND AND UH I VOLUNTEER A WHOLE LOT
AND UH THAT'S MY JOB RIGHT NOW AND I I LOVE IT I REALLY LOVE IT
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT AND THAT WILL COME I KNOW THAT DAY WILL COME AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT TOO BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT PHASE IN MY LIFE AND I AM I AM GLAD THAT I AM ABLE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO RIGHT NOW
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT YOU ARE NOT BEATING RUGS YOU ARE NOT RIGHT DOING LAUNDRY BY HAND AND THAT KIND OF THING
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S THAT WAY WITH MEN TOO I MEAN YOU KNOW MEN ARE SITTING BEHIND DESKS A WHOLE LOT MORE
THAN THEY USED TO
YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
AND STRESS DISORDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
RIGHT RIGHT
YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY
YEAH YEAH IT'S FUNNY IT'S FUNNY I WAS REA- I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SUMMER THINKING OH WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME TIME OFF
AND IT'S BEEN REAL BUSY AND ACTUALLY TODAY IS REALLY THE FIRST AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER
BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH GOING ON THE PAST FEW WEEKS
AND UH YOU ARE RIGHT UH WELL THAT'S HOW SOCIETY HAS CHANGED UH YOU KNOW UH
THE FAMILY HAS CHANGED WE YOU KNOW WE FIND OURSELVES DOING THINGS THAT WE NEVER DID AS KIDS
YOU KNOW I DO NOT REMEMBER BEING INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE THIS IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S JUST
I DO NOT KNOW ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHETHER IT'S BETTER OR WORSE THAN THE WAY WE GREW UP BUT UH IT'S IT'S JUST VERY DIFFERENT UM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT BUT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE WORKING FULL TIME AND HAVE TO COME HOME AND PREPARE A MEAL AND GET HOMEWORK DONE AND YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU FIND THE TIME
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
THAT'S VERY TRUE AND THEN THAT WAY WE HAVE NOT CHANGED IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS HAVE WE YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THAT'S VERY TRUE THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE I AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND YESTERDAY WHO SAID SHE HAS A NEW POLICY IN HER HOME AND WHEN HER HER FAMILY COMES TO HER AND SAYS
FIX THIS YOU KNOW I AM HAVING A PROBLEM WITH YOU KNOW ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY SHE SAID I HAVE TAKEN A NEW STANCE AND I SAY NO I WILL NOT YOU KNOW YOU WORK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF
AND SHE SAID IT'S AMAZING SHE SAID YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS FAMILY EXPECTS ME TO GET AND THEY DRA- SUCK ME INTO THESE ARGUMENTS AND THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I HA- I AM SUPPOSED TO BE
THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO FIX IT ALL AND AND SOOTHE EVERYBODY AND SHE SAID I AM NOT DOING IT ANYMORE I I JUST
UM UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
HI
O- ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I HAVE CONSIDERED ABOUT THE ROLE CHANGE FOR WOMEN IS THAT
WOMEN OF MY AGE MY GENERATION WERE TRAINED AND TAUGHT AND BROUGHT UP TO BE THE LEAVE IT TO BEAVER HOUSEWIVES BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN THAT WORLD
UH-HUH FAMILIES UH-HUH OH YEAH SURE
UH-HUH
BUT CHARACTERISTICALLY YOU KNOW THE WOMEN ARE TRAINED OR HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST TRAINED IN THE HOME
AND I REALLY WOULD BE AT A LOSS TO TO RAISE AND TRAIN A GIRL I THINK I WOULD
OH SURE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH SURE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
SURE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
I DID VERY MUCH THE SAME THING UNTIL MY BOYS GOT INTO HIGH SCHOOL AND SAID MOM PLEASE DO NOT BE INVOLVED
THEN I WENT BACK TO WORK
YEAH
SURE
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ACTUALLY AND AND IT'S
IT'S IT'S LIKE THE IT'S LIKE OIL ON TOP OF WATER IT CHANGES BUT IT'S NEVER DIFFERENT IN A LOT OF WAYS
UH
WOMEN AT ONE TIME DID VERY HEAVY PHYSICAL LABOR
AND WERE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A HOUSEHOLD
THEN AS TIMES CHANGED
UH AS IT IS TODAY WE DO NOT DO A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR EVEN IN HOUSE EVEN IN HOUSEKEEPING AND HOMEMAKING THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR BECAUSE THERE ARE
UH-HUH RIGHT
AND IN THAT RESPECT WE HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES BECOME INVOLVED IN PHYSICAL EXERTION OR WE REALLY DO DEVELOP SOME HEALTH PROBLEMS
SO IN IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT I AM NOT SO SURE THAT THE HARD WORK OF YEARS PAST WAS NOT BETTER FOR US THAN WE ARE WILLING TO ADMIT
AND UH
OH ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT'S THAT'S TRUE WITH SOCIETY IN GENERAL
BUT SPECIFICALLY THE WOMAN'S ROLE IN SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND YOU KNOW M- MEDICAL REPORTS TELL US THAT WOMEN ARE DEVELOPING
DISEASES NOW THAT USED TO BE PREDOMINATELY MALE DISEASES HEART DISEASE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF MEN NOW THERE'S ALMOST EQUALLY PREDOMINANT IN WOMEN
AND I
UH-HUH UH-HUH RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A SYMPTOM OF OUR SOCIETY IT'S A SYMPTOM THAT THERE'S THERE'S A GENERAL ILLNESS THAT NEEDS TO BE HEALED
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HEALING PROCESS WOULD BE OR WHAT WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM I AM NOT I AM NOT GOD
BUT I I DO KNOW THAT IN RAISING MY BOYS
I REALLY DID MEET A LOT OF PRESSURES SAYING YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO MUSIC LESSONS YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO SPORTS YOU NEED TO GET THEM INTO THIS THEY NEED TO BE BUSY AND THEY NEED TO BE ACTIVE
AND I FOUGHT ALL OF THOSE THINGS I SAID IF THOSE BOYS WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT THEY WILL COME TO ME AND THEY WILL SAY MOM THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME I WANT TO DO IT OTHERWISE I WILL GUARD  THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE QUIET TIME
I REFUSED TO CRAM THEIR LIVES FULL AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH A WOMAN TOO
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH WELL
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OF COURSE
UH-HUH
WELL I JUST AM VERY MUCH A BELIEVER IN QUIET PERSONAL TIME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO TALK TO YOURSELF WHO ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO RIGHT
AND I GUARDED MY CHILDREN'S RIGHTS FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOMEN ARE SACRIFICING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DO
THEY ARE SACRIFICING THEIR TIME WITH THEMSELVES
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SITTING AND BEING BORED IF YOU ARE THINKING INTERNALLY AND YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR OWN SELF YOU ARE FINDING OUT WHO YOU ARE
WELL I THINK
UM WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S NOT YOUR HOMEWORK IT'S YOUR CHILDREN'S HOMEWORK
AND I WAS ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL TO BE THERE ONLY WHEN THEY CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME FOR HELP I HELPED THEM WITH EXACTLY WHAT THEY ASKED FOR AND THAT'S ALL
THAT'S A PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD AND THAT IS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THINGS THAT REALLY ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S RESPONSIBILITIES
THEY
THEY
THAT'S RIGHT THAT WAY HUSBANDS ARE CRIPPLED
THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL CRIPPLES AND SO ARE CHILDREN THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMSELVES
FOR THEMSELVES I DO NOT KNOW WHY GOD MADE WOMEN BRILLIANT  I
THEY TEND TO LOOK AT THE MOTHER AS THE ONE WHO SOLVES ALL PROBLEMS THEY ARE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE AND THAT'S NEVER CHANGED
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT
UH-HUH
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TODAY THAT IS VERY USEFUL AND I THINK EVERY WOMAN OUGHT TO DEAL WITH IT OR OUGHT TO AT LEAST BE EXPOSED TO IT AND THAT IS MEDIATION TRAINING
UH WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT STRIKES OR THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDIATORS WHO GET INVOLVED IN FAMILY CRISES PARENTS AND CHILDREN HUSBANDS AND WIVES UH YOU KNOW BOSS AND EMPLOYEE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
INTERPERSONAL MEDIATION BECAUSE THE MEDIATOR IS AN UNBIASED BYSTANDER WHO
OKAY SO WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
NO NO NOT AT ALL I WORK WITH COMPUTERS
YEP THEY WHAT ONE THING I
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT HAVE CHILDREN UH NOT THAT MANY ACTUALLY
UH
I DO NOT REALLY KNOW
EXCUSE ME TOO MUCH ABOUT CHILD CARE IN NEW YORK UM
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND
HUH-UH
NO NOT AT ALL IN FACT MY SITUATION IS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE I WAS UH A STUDENT FOR MANY YEARS AND THEN GRADUATED AND WENT AND WORKED IN FRANCE FOR AWHILE
AND I'VE JUST COME BACK AND WAS DOING CONSULTING WORK SO I AM JUST TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME OFF RIGHT NOW UH AND I MIGHT
YEAH WELL HOPEFULLY I CAN DO SOME CONSULTING WORK AT HOME AND IF I CAN DO THAT IT WILL YEAH I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND THE TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT CHILD CARE
BUT UH I MIGHT START TO GO CRAZY WITH IT TOO IT IS A LITTLE I- I MISS THE INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I REALLY IT WOULD BREAK MY HEART TO GIVE HER TO A STRANGER RIGHT NOW AND
OH YES
YEAH
WELL I THINK FOR ME THE IMPORTANT CONCERNS I DO NOT THINK I WOULD PUT HER IN DAY CARE FOR JOINT SITUATION RIGHT NOW UNLESS IT WAS LIKE ONE OTHER CHILD WITH A WITH A PERSON
I WOULDN'T WANT HER TO BE INTO A IN A LARGE DAY CARE SITUATION SO YOUNG BECAUSE I THINK A LITTLE INFANT JUST DOESN'T GET THE STIMULATION THEY NEED
YEAH MAYBE FOR IF I NEEDED TO DO WORK PART TIME LIKE FOUR HOURS A DAY I MIGHT DO THAT BECAUSE LIKE YOU SHOULD GET ENOUGH STIMULATION FROM ME THE REST OF THE TIME BUT UH I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S TWO YEAR OLDS RUNNING AROUND
THE WHOEVER IS TAKING CARE OF THEM THE CARE GIVERS ARE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE TWO YEAR OLDS AND ONLY WHEN THE INFANT SCREAMS ARE THEY GOING TO GO THERE AND IF NOT THE INFANT IS GOING TO LAY IN THE CRIB ALL DAY AND MAYBE HAVE A MOBILE ABOVE IT TO PLAY WITH
AND YOU KNOW I PLAY WITH HER MOST OF THE TIME SHE'S AWAKE AND I THINK THAT IS SO IMPORTANT
YEAH
WELL SUCH AS THINGS FOR LEARNING GIVES THE CHILD THE STIMULATION I THINK IS IMPORTANT
AND UH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH WELL SHE'S SHE'S JUST BEEN DOING ALL KINDS OF STUFF WHERE SHE'S YOU KNOW
SHE'S TWO MONTHS NOW NINE WEEKS AND SHE'S JUST DRASTICALLY MOVING HER EYES FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SHE'S JUST STARTED THAT LIKE YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE
AND SO EVERY DAYS ARE DIFFERENT AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I THINK CHILD CARE FOR INFANTS IS MUCH HARDER THAN WHEN THEY ARE OLDER AND
I'LL PROBABLY BE GOING BACK TO WORK AROUND JANUARY WHEREAS SHE'LL BE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS OLD AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW SHE'LL BE AT A I HAVE HEARD IT'S A ROUGHAGE TO PUT THEM INTO A
YEAH
BUT BUT I THINK IT
YEAH WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT UH BUT I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW LEAVE HER A FAIR AMOUNT EVEN AT THIS YOUNG AGE WITH HER GRANDPARENTS JUST TO GO TO A MOVIE AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT SHE'S USED TO OTHER PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF HER
MY PARENTS MY HUSBAND'S PARENTS ARE IN FRANCE SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER BUT DURING YOU KNOW SHE SHE SHE'S MET THEM ALREADY
NOT THAT SHE WILL REMEMBER THEM BUT SHE'S MET THEM
UH-HUH
ARE THEY ALL NEARBY
YEAH
WELL IF I WORK PART TIME THAT MIGHT BE DOABLE
YEAH WELL RIGHT NOW THE SITUATION IS SO TIGHT AT MANY PLACES THAT IT'S EVEN HARD TO HAVE A CHOICE
INCREDIBLE BUT YOU KNOW SINCE THIS IS PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET PREGNANT ARE FINDING CHILD CARE FOR THE KIDS  AND YOU KNOW I JUST FIND THAT INCREDIBLE AND MY SISTER-IN-LAW IS GOING TO HAVE A BABY VERY VERY SOON AND SHE'S INTENDING TO STAY HOME WITH THE BABY
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE DO SOME FREELANCE TYPE WORK FROM HOME AND SO IF I GO BACK TO WORK ON A PART TIME BASIS I'M HOPING I CAN LEAVE MY DAUGHTER WITH HER BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER YOU KNOW AGAIN WILL BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS
MY DAUGHTER WILL BE ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLDER THAN HERS AND YOU KNOW IT'LL BE A LITTLE ROUGH WHEN SHE IS A VERY VERY LITTLE INFANT BUT LIKE WHEN SHE IS A MONTH OR SO MY SISTER-IN-LAW HAS HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH BABYSITTING FOR LARGE FAMILIES AND SO UH
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT A COUPLE OF HOURS A DAY AND WE COUL- MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO DO IT ON A TRADE OFF BASIS THAT I WATCH THEIR BABY WHEN THEY WANT TO GO OUT TO DINNER OR TO MOVIES OR WHATEVER OR IF SHE WANTS AN AFTERNOON OFF EVEN IF SHE WANTS AN AFTERNOON JUST TO WORK
UH AND NOT BE BOTHERED WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE THAT WAY
AND SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT BUT I THINK THE WHOLE YOU KNOW IDEALLY I THINK THE
BUSINESSES SHOULD HAVE THE DAY CARE CENTERS THERE WHETHER IT'S THE PARENTS WHO TAKE TURNS WATCHING THE KIDS OR WHETHER THEY HIRE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND UH YOU KNOW PARENTS COME DOWN TO SUPERVISE OR WHATEVER
UM
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH WELL SHE'S MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ON A REAL SCHEDULE YET AND IT'S PROBABLY MY FAULT BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE A REAL SCHEDULE NOW BUT
YEAH WELL SHE'S BEEN STAYING UP LATE AT NIGHT AND  YOU KNOW SLEEPING LATE IN THE MORNINGS AND THINGS IS JUST FINE BY ME
RIGHT
D-  DO YOU WORK WITH DO YOU WORK AROUND CHILDREN WHEN YOU WORK WITH COMPUTERS
OKAY DO YOU HA- BUT YOU HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE CHILDREN
THAT HAVE BEEN
UH-HUH WHAT IS CHILD CARE LIKE IN NEW YORK WHAT IS
DOES THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR HAVE CHILD CARE ON PREMISES FOR THE EMPLOYEES
OH
OH MY
A SABBATICAL
WELL I HOPE YOU CAN STAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WITH
OH THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
I THINK IT DOES WHEN WHEN THEY'RE REAL LITTLE AND THEY'RE CHANGING EVERY DAY THERE'S AND YOU JUST MISS THE LITTLE THINGS AND AND UH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT WELL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE BONDING THAT THEY DO IT WITH THE MOTHER THIS IS
RIGHT
OUR OLDEST GRANDSON WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD WENT INTO A A MONTESSORI DAY CARE SYSTEM AND THEY TOOK INFANTS STARTING AT SIX WEEKS AND THEY HAVE A PROGRAM UH
IN THAT WAS DEVISED BY THIS MONTESSORI PERSON AND UH A CERTAIN TYPE OF STIMULATIONS AND THERE'S TIMES OF DAY THAT EVEN WHEN THE CHILD IS AWAKE THAT THEY THEY LAY QUIETLY
AND LOOK AT CERTAIN THINGS THEY KEEP DELIBERATELY KEEP THE ROOM NOT REAL BRIGHT AND AND UH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS THEY'LL THEY'LL PUT THEM DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND OF COURSE THEY NEVER HAVE MORE THAN LIKE FIVE
AND AND THEY'LL PUT THEM DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND THEY WILL HAVE OH I THINK ONE OF THEM WAS A LITTLE MIRROR AND SOME WERE JUST DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT HAVE HAD A DEFINITE PURPOSE FOR KIDS YOU KNOW AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR EYES
UH HOW OLD IS SHE NOW OH YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM
IT IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE CLINGING TO MAMA SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT
I THINK IT IT HURTS THE PARENTS TO LEAVE WHEN THE CHILD IS CRYING SO IT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE IDEAL IF YOU COULD GET SOMEBODY IN SO YOU ARE NOT REALLY LEAVING THE CHILD IN A STRANGE PLACE BUT THAT'S UNUSUAL
UH-HUH
IS IT YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR YOUR HUSBAND'S PARENTS
OH
RIGHT RIGHT  THAT'S NICE WHEN UH I MY I HAVE THREE GRANDCHILDREN ANOTHER ONE COMING IN SEPTEMBER AND I IT WOULD IF THEY WERE
WHERE I COULDN'T GET MY HANDS ON THEM I'M AFRAID I WOULD PROBABLY GO CRAZY I YOU KNOW I- I LIKE THAT BUT IF IT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PUT THEM IN CHILD CARE THAT'S
THAT'S AN IDEAL SITUATION FOR YOU IS TO STAY WITH THEM AS OR YOU CAN  SET UP YOUR WORK PROGRAM AND YOUR HUSBAND'S SO THAT ONE OF YOU IS THERE ALL THE TIME THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR THE CHILD
BUT RIGHT AND YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO WITH CHILD CARE YOU REALLY NEED TO TO
LOOK AT WHAT YOUR OPTIONS ARE AND AND LOOK AT THE WHAT THEY OFFER DROP IN AT TIMES THAT
ARE UNEXPECTED THE
UH
UH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
OH
OH THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH UH-HUH
OH
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
I DO TOO
REALLY WELL TRAINED PEOPLE RIGHT AND HAVE HAVE SOME KIND OF REAL GOOD PROGRAM SET UP SO THAT YOU WHEN YOU GO YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY THAT PERSON IN CHARGE KNOWS CPR OR FIRST AID OR
AND AND HAVE SOME KIND OF PROGRAM SET UP LIKE YOU SAY TO STIMULATE THE KIDS OR EDUCATE THEM IN SOME MANNER AND HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TOYS AND THE RIGHT SETTING AND
UH HAVE A AN ORGANIZED TYPE OF PROGRAM SET UP SO THAT THE KIDS HAVE A SCHEDULE YOU KNOW THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO LITTLE KIDS
UH-HUH THEY THEY ADJUST TO WHAT THE PARENTS
UH-HUH
WE- YOU KNOW THAT WORKS UNTIL THEY START SCHOOL AND THAT'S A PROBLEM SOCIETY IS GEARED TO A A DAY PERSON AND IT'S
OKAY WELL I UH I GUESS BECAUSE I WORK QUITE A BIT WITH LAWYERS I'M NOT A LAWYER UH THAT I FIND A LOT OF THINGS ARE SO SPECIALIZED THAT I'M NOT SURE
AND I I LOOK AT IT MORE FROM THE CIVIL SIDE OF THINGS THAT JURIES HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF THE VALUE OF AND WORTH SO THAT THEY HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WHEN IT COMES TO UH UH THEY CAN FIND GUILT OR INNOCENCE
UH BUT THEN WHEN YOU QUANTIFY THINGS AND THAT MIGHT ALSO HOLD CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR HOW MANY YEARS IS APPROPRIATE UH THAT THEY MIGHT LEAVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO UH HAS EXPERTISE IN THAT
UH-HUH
YEAH BECAUSE I FIND THAT UH I'VE BEEN ON A FEW JURIES AND UH AS A SAY I I TEND TO BE AROUND UH CIVIL CASES
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AN EXPERT WITNESS SOME AND UH
MANY MATTERS ARE SO COMPLICATED THAT IT'S SO HARD TO UH COME UP WITH THE FAIR VALUE UH
OR THE FAIR SENTENCE AND ONE THING THAT YOU GET IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERTISE IS
UH YOU KNOW THE RANGE OF OF POSSIBLE VALUES OR TERMS OR YOU KNOW HOW HEINOUS WAS THE CRIME
UH THAT UH WHEN I ONLY DO SOMETHING ONE TWO OR THREE TIMES I'M HARDLY AN EXPERT ON IT AND
MOST JURIES
OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOU MIGHT SIT ON THREE
AND SO HOW DO YOU RELATE AS TO WHETHER THIS
PARTICULAR ARMED ROBBERY WAS A YOU KNOW WORTH FIVE YEARS OR TWENTY FIVE
UM-HUM
YES
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL ONE OF THE OTHERS THINGS THAT GETS ME ON ON THE JURIES IS THAT OFTEN IN THE NEWSPAPER
I I TEND TO HEAR TWO THINGS WELL THAT GO ON ONE IS YOU OFTEN SEE IN THE HEADLINES
THE BIG NUMBERS
UH AND MANY OF THOSE GET OVERTURNED OR GET REDUCED IN TERMS OF SENTENCES OR GET CHANGED
BY A JUDGE OR AN APPEALS COURT AND THAT NEVER MAKES THE THE PRESS AND SO WHEN UH YOU OR I AS AN INDIVIDUAL
GETS ON A JURY WE TEND TO HAVE CERTAIN MENTAL IMAGES OF WHAT'S WHAT BECAUSE WE SEE THE HEADLINES
UH AND WE DON'T HAVE UH AGAIN A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON WHAT IS UH
REALLY THE RANGE OF SENTENCES OR AWARDS THAT ARE UH ARE ACTUALLY UH IN THE END APPLIED
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL THAT'S WHERE UH UH THE ROLE OF JURIES IS IS RESTRICTED AND UH I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT TO CHANGE THAT ASPECT OF IT ONE IS IT'S RESTRICTED IN THE SENSE THAT
JURIES ONLY DECIDE THE CHARGES THAT ARE ACTUALLY UH BROUGHT YOU KNOW IF IT'S FIRST DEGREE RAPE SECOND DEG- DEGREE RAPE OR WHATEVER
THEY ONLY GET TO DECIDE ON THAT WELL OKAY THIS PERSON HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH FIRST DEGREE RAPE UH AND YOU CAN DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE ON THAT UH SUCH LIKE MAYBE IN MURDER THEY GET TO CHOOSE WHETHER IT'S UH PREMEDITATED OR
ONE OR TWO OF THE LESSER DEGREES AN- THE OTHER THING THAT JURIES ARE RESTRICTED ON AND AND AT LEAST TO ME THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FRUSTRATING THINGS IN MY EVEN IN MY OWN EXPERIENCES THAT YOU
USUALLY DON'T GET TO HEAR ALL THE INFORMATION IT'S WHAT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED AND
UH I DON'T KNOW THAT JURIES HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW MORE BECAUSE IN A SENSE WE CALL THOSE SAFEGUARDS BUT OFTEN JURIES HEAR ONLY A FRACTION OF THE OF THE STORY
WHEN THEY HAVE TO DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE
UM-HUM
YEAH AND THE TRUTH THAT'S BROUGHT OUT IS UH AS I SAY WHEN I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW THE OATH IS TO TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
IS THAT THEY WANT UH THEY DON'T WANT UH THE WHOLE TRUTH I MEAN YOU CAN SAY YEAH THE BECAUSE STORIES LOOK VERY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HEAR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OF THE TRUTH
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT I AGREE TOO I DON'T THINK THE JURY SHOULD BE THE ONES THAT THAT PUT THE SENSINGS SENTENCINGS DOWN I THINK THE JUDGES SHOULD OR EVEN A PANEL OF OF LAWYERS IF IF IT GOT TO THAT POINT
MIGHT BE BETTER APT THAN JUST REGULAR CIVIL PEOPLE
NOT KNOWING YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THINGS ARE  FROM FROM MURDER ON UP TO LIKE TAX STUFF YOU KNOW
RIGHT
YEAH AND
RIGHT THAT'S YEAH AN- AND AND MOST PEOPLE THAT DO SIT ON JURIES SOME PEOPLE JUST SIT ON THEM ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE THAT LUCKY SOMETIMES  OR YOU KNOW WHAT WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AND AND MAY NOT HAVE ANY IDEA
OF WHAT WHAT THE STANDARD PUNISHMENT WOULD BE FOR IT AND IT THEY MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT IDEA I MEAN IT MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO PUT A SEN- SEN- SENTENCING DOWN THAT WAS UH
LONGER YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T FIT THE PUNISHMENT DIDN'T FIT THE CRIME
OR NOT LONG ENOUGH OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE
I I THINK THE JUDGES DO HAVE THAT THAT BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF IT THE ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT SOMETIMES IS IF IF YOU GET SOMEBODY IN THERE THAT THAT HAS A NAME THAT IS THE DEFENDANT AND
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES MIGHT HA- HAVE MORE PULL WHICH THAT DOES HAPPEN I MEAN W- WE CAN'T SAY IT DOESN'T BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN I MEAN NOT EVERYBODY IS IS YOU KNOW
HAS HAS THE RIGHT MORALS SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE CAN BE PAID OFF OR POLITICALLY OR
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AND SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT REAL FAIR EITHER THOUGH SO
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT WELL WELL ALSO WHAT I DON'T THINK IS FAIR EITHER IS WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE A SAY A RAPIST COME IN AND AND HIS ATTORNEY
GETS HIS SENTENCES SENTENCING REDUCED BECAUSE HE'S GONE TO A LESSER CHARGE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ASSAULT OR SOMETHING OR
BUT WHICH THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME EITHER I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PROVE RAPE AND WHATNOT AND AND AND THE PERSON THAT WAS RAPED OR WHATEVER DOESN'T I MEAN IT'S EMBARRASSING AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF AND THEY THEY'RE PUT ON LIKE
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT CAUSED IT OR WHATEVER BUT TO ME WHEN YOU DO THE CRIME
THEN YOU SHOULD PAY FOR WHATEVER YOU DID AND AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO ON THE LESSER CHARGE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE ALL'S THAT'S GOING TO DO IS SAY OH WELL YOU KNOW THAT WAS A BREEZE I CAN GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN AND YOU KNOW
HAVE THE SAME THING HAPPEN THAT'S THAT'S NOT RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
AND TO ME HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE A DECISION IF YOU DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF WHETHER IT BE WHETHER IT PERTAINS TO THE CASE OR NOT SOMEBODY THINKS IT IT HAD BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT IT THERE
SO THE LAWYERS THE TWO LAWYERS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION DON'T THEY
THEY ONLY PUT PART OF IT
YEAH
RIGHT WELL THAT'S JUST LIKE THAT OLD WITNESS GAME WELL IT'S A GAME KIDS PLAY TOO BUT UM
SOMEBODY DID IT JUST AH
JUST FOR YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT WHERE THEY THEY SHOWED SOMETHING
OKAY
ALL RIGHT WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW I- I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT QUESTION ABOUT AIDS SO I HAVEN'T THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I GUESS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE RESEARCH UM I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO BE SUCH A MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM
AND IF WE YOU KNOW AND IF IT'S NOT I SAY IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THE SOONER WE TAKE CARE OF IT THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THINK AND IT'S GOING TO START AFFECTING ALL OF THE POPULATION YOU KNOW I MEAN RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU KNOW AND IT'S JUST GOING TO BECOME SUCH A HUGE ISSUE
AND IT'S JUST SO SCARY THAT THERE'S JUST NOT MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE AT THIS POINT SO I GUESS
YES
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
W-
WELL I THINK SO TOO AND SO I GUESS I WOULD YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I WOULD BE REALLY IN FAVOR OF THAT NOW I HAVE HAD UM I HAVE TWO FRIENDS WHO'VE DIED OF IT
AND UH SO AND THOSE HAVE JUST YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BEEN REAL HARD AND I JUST HATE SEEING PEOPLE YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THIS
SO AND I KEEP THINKING IT'S GOING TO HIT OUR CHURCH EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE UH I- IT'S REAL INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE'VE NOT HAD ANYBODY YET BUT YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO JUST START AFFECTING I THINK EVERYONE
I KNOW
IT IS REALLY SCARY YOU KNOW I- I THOUGHT OF THAT FOR MYSELF FOR LIKE FOR MY CHILDREN THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE WHOLE BLOOD ISSUE IS VERY SCARY
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE THING THERE'S A F- THERE'S A TIME FACTOR IN THERE
I KNOW
I KNOW
WELL THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW PEOPLE GIVE BLOOD INNOCENTLY ENOUGH ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE OKAY I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WOULD GIVE BLOOD IF THEY FELT THEY I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THEY MIGHT BUT
UH YOU KNOW I- I WOULD HATE TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE I WOULD NEED A TRANSFUSION OR MY CHILDREN I THINK IT WOULD BE A REAL SCARY THING
OH
YEAH REALLY
THERE YEAH RIGHT WELL BECAUSE YEAH THEN WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO
UM THEY HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES I SUPPOSE UM
WELL I I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I JUST BUT THEN I THINK WELL UH YEAH I GUESS THAT BASICALLY I DO THINK WE JUST NEED MORE RESEARCH BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO SORT OF BE THE OUR ONLY ANSWER
WELL AND I WORRY YOU KNOW THE OLDER MY CHILDREN GET THE MORE EXPO- CHANCES OF EXPOSURE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE I MEAN I CAN'T IMAGINE WELL EVEN FOR YOU BEING A SINGLE PERSON I MEAN I THINK GOSH HOW SCARY YOU KNOW TO MEET PEOPLE AND
UH Y- YOU KNOW
UH
YEAH  THAT MIGHT EVENTUALLY HAPPEN BUT UH
I MEAN
I MEAN REALLY
I KNOW WELL IT'S JUST A IT'S JUST A SAD THING AND I DON'T KNOW HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO GET TAKEN CARE OF AT SOME POINT
YEAH
OH THIS WAS YOUR HUSBAND WASN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT YOU TOLD ME THAT BUT I'D FORGOTTEN
UH-HUH
AZT
HUM
WELL I KNOW AND A- YOU KNOW AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE TH- THAT CAN USE IT I YOU KNOW IF I WERE SICK I WOULD TRY ANYTHING I THINK I MEAN WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S SO CRAZY I MEAN WHAT'S TO LOSE AT THIS POINT
I WOULD IF IT WERE ME
YEAH I MEAN YEAH YOU'D WANT YOU'D WANT EVERYTHING AVAILABLE AND THEN TO THINK WELL IT'S AVAILABLE BUT YOU C- I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU COULD ONLY GET IT IN EUROPE UM
W-
WOULD BE A TERRIBLE
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE THING
BUT UM HOW LONG WAS HE HOW LONG WAS RANDY SICK
HUM
YEAH
HM
SO HE WAS REALLY SUSCEPTIBLE
THAT'S AWFUL
HUH
UM-HUM
UM
UM
WELL IN SOME WAYS THAT'S A BLESSING
I MEAN IT'S SUCH A
AWFUL THING TO SUFFER THROUGH
WELL MY
HUH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I KNOW IT IS WELL MY TWO FRIENDS BOTH ONE ONE LIVED A FAIRLY LONG TIME WITH IT I'D SAY KEN HAD IT
WELL HE THINKS HE HAD HE WAS HIV FOR TEN YEARS YOU KNOW I MEAN HE NO HE THINKS HE HAD IT EVEN BACK IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES UM
AND THEN HE DIED IN EIGHTY NINE
OKAY START US
YEAH
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE
YE-
YEAH
IT ALREADY HAS
RIGHT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE DOING A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THEY WERE FIVE YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIVING LONGER AND AND THEIR MEDICINES ARE A WHOLE LOT BETTER SO THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO GO THROUGH AS MANY OF THE AS OF THE OTHER DISEASES
OR SO IT SOUNDS ANYWAY AS YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN ALL OF THIS FIRST STARTED OUT THEY THEY CAME DOWN WITH EVERY SINGLE DISEASE THAT CAME DOWN THE PIPE BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEY SUFFERED SO MUCH WORSE
SO YOU KNOW AT AT LEAST THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS BUT THEY'VE GOT TO GET IT STOPPED THEY'VE GOT TO FIND A CURE
SO HAVE I
YEAH
WELL YEAH
WELL ESPECIALLY WITH YOU KNOW SURGERIES ALL THE TIME
IT'S SO SCARY
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH AND YOU KNOW WELL WITH THE TIME FACTOR IT COULD BE UP TO TEN YEARS
YOU KNOW SO THAT'S WHAT'S SO BAD AND AND YOU MAY TEST NEGATIVE THIS TIME BUT YOU MAY TEST POSITIVE YOU KNOW TWO WEEKS DOWN THE ROAD
SO
THE TEST IS RELEVANT FOR THAT VERY DAY BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOREVER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH A- AND LIKE WHEN I WENT IN THE HOSPITAL YOU HAVE TO SIGN A PAPER SAYING THAT THAT YOU'LL ALLOW THEM TO GIVE BLOOD IF THEY IF YOU NEED IT OTHERWISE THEY WON'T DO THE SURGERY
SO WHAT DO YOU DO I MEAN YEAH YOU'RE GIVEN THE OPTION OF SIGNING OR NOT SIGNING BUT IF YOU SAY NO I DON'T WANT THE BLOOD THEN THEY THEY MAY SAY WELL THEN I'M NOT GOING TO DO THE SURGERY
RIGHT RIGHT WHA- WHAT CAN THEY DO
WELL Y- THAT'S RIGHT AND THEY'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEY CAN'T PUT IT ON THE BACK BURNER
AND JUST SAY WELL YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH IS GOING ON IS DOING GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERE'S NO CURE YET
YOU GOT IT
YEAH
OF COURSE I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM
SLIGHT CHANCE YOU THINK
UH THAT'S
OH I- IT IS IT'S LIKE OKAY SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS
THEN WE'LL TALK
YEAH WELL THEY'RE DOING A LOT OVER IN EUROPE
WITH IT
AND I KNOW WHEN RANDY WAS SO SICK HE WAS HAVING MEDICATIONS FLOWN IN FROM EUROPE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET HIS HANDS ON IT OVER HERE AND UH
UH-HUH
YEAH SO HE WAS HE HAD A LOT OF MEDICATION COMING IN FROM EUROPE
AND THEN HE FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GET THE WHAT IS IT AZT OVER HERE ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD CONNECTIONS THAT WAS NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AT THAT TIME
SO
I DON'T KNOW BUT THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S EVERYWHERE
TO EVERYBODY
Y-
OF COURSE
THAT'S RIGHT
THERE'S NOTHING TO LOSE SO YOU MAY AS WELL DO WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO
YEAH OR IF IT WAS ONE OF MY KIDS
RIGHT NO PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH
LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS
LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AND AT THAT POINT HE WAS THE FIFTH FIFTH
LONGEST SURVIVOR
BUT SEE THAT WAS ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO
AND NOW THEY'RE LIVING A WHOLE LOT LONGER
SO BUT HE I MEAN JEEZ HE HAD EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN HE HAD HEPATITIS HE HAD MENINGITIS HE GOT THROAT CANCER
AND HE NEVER SMOKED EVEN A GRAPEVINE MUCH LESS A CIGARETTE YOU KNOW UM
JUST YOU NAME IT HE HE JUST OH IT WAS HORRIBLE IT WAS HORRIBLE
YEAH AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE DIE FOUR MONTHS AFTER RANDY DID
AND UH HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS SICK HE'D JUST YOU KNOW HAD A COLD THAT HE COULDN'T SHAKE ALL WINTER
AND KEPT GETTING SICKER AND SICKER AND FINALLY WENT IN THE HOSPITAL AND UH HAD PNEUMONIA AND BOTH LUNGS WERE FULL AND HE DIED WITHIN ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
YEAH
YEAH YEAH AND HIS FRIEND HAD DIED THE YEAR BEFORE
AND THEY SWORE IT WASN'T AIDS BUT I KNOW DARN GOOD AND WELL IT WAS
YOU KNOW SO
OOH IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S CLOSE TO HOME
YOU'RE KIDDING
UM MY GOSH
UH-HUH
THE AIDS ISSUE IS
IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM I GUESS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND NOT HAVING ANY IMMEDIATE FRIENDS WITH THAT PROBLEM IS IS THE FINANCIAL END I MEAN HOW
CAN A COUNTRY STAND TO UH SPEND AS MUCH OR MUCH MORE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE
ON SUCH A PROBLEM UH BUT THEN THAT KIND OF THINKING IS ALSO TEMPERED WITH THE THE KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST THE THE RUMOR I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT THAT UH WE'RE NOT SPENDING
AS MUCH PER LET'S SAY AFFLICTED PERSON ON CANCER UH THERE'S SOME UH TAKE BREAST CANCER FOR INSTANCE IT SEEMS TO BE DOING MUCH MORE DAMAGE AND AFFECTING MUCH MORE PEO- MEAN MORE PEOPLE THAN AIDS
AND YET UH MORE PEOPLE DIE OF IT AND YET THE FUNDING IS ALREADY UH EXCEEDED AIDS HAS MORE MONEY THAN UH BREAST CANCER
SO UH I MEAN IF IT'S TRUE I I'VE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THESE THINGS I'VE NEVER BOTHERED TO DIG IT OUT AND MAKE SURE BUT UH
I'VE HEARD IT ON MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENTARY THAT UH THEY WERE COMPLAINING THAT
WHOEVER'S SITTING UP THERE MAKING THESE DECISIONS UH OR WHATEVER INSTITUTIONS RAISE THE MONEY AND UH
IT'S JUST ONE BIG PR CAMPAIGN THAT YEAH WE THINK THAT'S THE WORLD'S WORST THING SO LET'S GIVE MONEY TO AIDS
AND YET WE'VE HAD BREAST CANCER PROBLEMS FOR YEARS AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE
WELL OF COURSE ONE OF THE SHOWS I SAW WAS TAKING IT FROM THE ANGLE THAT SINCE IT DOESN'T EFFECT MEN IT'S NOT GONNA GET FUNDED
AND UH HAVING THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE
WELL I I KIND OF I THOUGHT WELL THAT THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN IN CONTROL OF THAT KIND OF THING BUT THEN I GO- I GOT TO THINKING
THE THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF MEN SEEMS TO BE THE PROSTATE AND THERE'S ONLY ONE TEST THAT JUST RECENTLY GOT DEVELOPED UH A BLOOD AN- ANTIGEN UH  ANTIBODY TEST FOR THE ANTIGEN IN THE BLOOD
AND THAT'S FAIRLY RECENT AND YET MEN HAVE BEEN DYING FROM PROSTATE CANCER FOR YEARS
SO IT'S NOT REALLY CURE F- YEAH IT'S NOT UH NOT THAT HEAVILY FUNDED EITHER AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE THE MAJOR
UH PROBLEMS THAT MEN HAVE IN THE REALM OF CANCER SO I DON'T KNOW I I GUESS THERE'S JUST SOME STRANGE PUBLIC OPINION AS TO WHO THEY WANT TO GIVE TO UM BE IT
THROUGH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS MARCH OF DIMES TYPE UH TELETHONS OR OR BICYCLE RIDES OR WHATEVER
HOW THEY FUND WHATEVER UM ILLNESS THEY WISH I- IT'S KIND OF HARD TO
TO GET AN EVEN KEEL ON THAT I MEAN IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WELL THERE'S YOU KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR AFFECTED BY THIS ONE SO LET'S GIVE IT THIS AMOUNT AND THEN THIS OTHER ONE'S ONLY A TENTH OF THAT SO GIVE IT A TENTH OF THAT AND AND JUST KEEP DOLING IT OUT THAT WAY OR
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE
YOU KNOW THE THE OTHER THOUGHT THAT I HAD UM I'VE HAD SEVERAL MINUTES TO THINK ABOUT THIS AFTER I UH WHILE I WAS FINDING PEOPLE I UH
I COULD THINK ABOUT THE TOPIC LONGER THAN THE PERSON THAT RECEIVES IT SO IT'S KIND OF A
A UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AS THEY WERE BUT
THE OTHER THING THAT I'VE THOUGHT OF ON THIS IS I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY
UH IN OUR ECONOMY OR IN OUR SYSTEM UH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT GOES TO THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY DO A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD I MEAN YEAH THEY'RE KIND OF NICE BUT
WE HAVE SUCH AN AFFLUENT -OCIETY SOCIETY THAT I WONDER IF IF WE TOOK A LITTLE FROM HERE AND THERE AND THE OTHER IF WE MIGHT WIND UP WITH A UH CURE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING OF COURSE THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY ROOM TO PUT PEOPLE BUT THAT'S
YEAH YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THESE RIDICULOUS FIGURES FOR PIZZA OR YOU HEAR THESE THESE  PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS SPENT FOR THIS THAT OR THE OTHER AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL THE ARTS THAT THAT ARE NICE AND AESTHETIC BUT
ARE THEY THAT ENHANCING FOR THE M- FOR THE MASSES YOU KNOW THEY CERTAINLY DO WELL FOR THOSE WHO GO TO THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND ALL THAT BUT UH
AND WELL THAT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT YEAH
RIGHT
HM THEY'VE NOT REALLY GIVEN IT ATTENTION EITHER YEAH
RIGHT
WELL I'M I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S
YOU WISH THAT THERE COULD JUST BE MONEY FOR ALL THESE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SO SERIOUS YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S NOT SO SERIOUS I GUESS UNTIL IT AFFECTS YOUR FAMILY AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
SO I I WOULD HATE TO HAVE THAT  RESPONSIBILITY JUST PERSONALLY BUT BUT THEN AGAIN WE REALLY WE REALLY DO HAVE IT AS A SOCIETY JUST DECIDES WHICH THINGS WE NEED TO ADDRESS
I UH
I GUESS I IT IT FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK  OF SO MANY PEOPLE WITH WITH AIDS AND WITH CANCER AND
MANY OF THOSE THINGS UM IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TO BE INSURED THEN THE COUNTRY'S GONNA PAY FOR IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH
PREVENTION OR OR TREATMENT OR YOU KNOW
JUST UH JUST HELPING THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
SO IT SEEMS LIKE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE'RE GONNA END UP PAYING FOR IT
JUST CHANGE OUR P-
RIGHT JUST CHANGE OUR PRIORITIES A LITTLE BIT AND
RIGHT

WELL NOT THE RAIN SO MUCH AS THE COOL THE OTHER MORNINGS WHEN IT WAS LIKE SIXTY FIVE WHEN WE WOKE UP AND SIXTY SIX
AND TODAY AND I WHEN I GOT UP THE THE TEMPERATURE SAID MORE LIKE OF COURSE SEVENTY NINE OR EIGHTY
SO I'M KIND OF READY FOR THE PUMPKIN WEATHER
YOU DON'T ARE YOU A SUMMER PERSON
ARE YOU
WELL I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S THE SAME WAY AND ANYTHING BELOW SIXTY SHE'S JUST NOT HAPPY BUT I- I THINK WHAT I WOULD MISS IS THE CHANGE OF SEASONS AND ALL BECAUSE I KNOW IN PLANO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE AS MANY SEASONS AS THE
MY HUSBAND'S FROM NEBRASKA AND THEY HAVE MORE OF THE FOUR SEASONS
OH YOU'RE USED TO THAT TOO
YOU DON'T LIKE THE COLD WELL I USUALLY LIKE IT ABOUT SWEATER WEATHER AND THE PROBLEM HERE IN PLANO IS IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG IT GOES FROM HOT AND THEN YOU GET A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF THAT INDIAN SUMMER AND THEN IT'S COLD
AND I WISH IT WERE SEVERAL MONTHS OF THAT
WELL I DON'T EITHER UNLESS IT'S LIKE UH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE'S LIKE A FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN IT RAINS AND YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO AND IT'S SLEEPING TIME BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND GET OUT IN IT I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER
NO
OH YEAH
WELL SURE IT DOES THAT KIND OF SCHEDULE YOU REALLY NEED A LOT MORE SUNSHINE
AND ALSO THE EVENINGS ARE GOING TO BE GETTING UH DARKER SOONER
BECAUSE AS IT GETS COOLER
BUT I DID A WALK LAST NIGHT AND IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HOT STILL SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WORK UP A SWEAT YOU NEED IT TO BE A LITTLE BIT COOLER
WELL I AGREE ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALL RELATIVE BECAUSE I WAS FROM WEST TEXAS AND IT WAS VERY DRY AND SO I THOUGHT DALLAS WAS AWFUL
AND I STILL THINK SO BUT THEN THIS SUMMER WE WENT TO ORLANDO FOR A WEEK AND IT WAS SO HUMID THERE
THAT YOUR UM ALL YOUR WINDOWS WERE  WERE WET EVERY MORNING THEY HAD TO GET THE SQUEEGEES AND CLEAN THEM OFF AND WHEN WE GOT BACK TO DALLAS IT SEEMED REALLY DRY BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT YOU'RE USED TO BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THE HUMIDITY ESPECIALLY FOR CURLY HEADS LIKE ME
YES I DO NOT LIKE THE HUMIDI-
UM-HUM
YEAH I THINK SO TOO I KNOW OUR GRASS NEEDS MOWING TWICE AS OFTEN WHEN IT RAINS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HERE I WOULD LIKE IT TO RAIN AND THEN BE OVER AND THEN NOT RAIN FOR A WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN A RAIN PATTERN THAT'S ALL IT DOES
SO UH BUT I- I AM READY FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THE COOLER WEATHER AND NOT SO MUCH IN THE NINETIES BUT SOMETHING LIKE I GUESS MY MY BEST WOULD BE PROBABLY
SIXTY EIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP OR SIXTY SIX AND THEN PROBABLY SEVENTY FIVE DURING THE DAY
YEAH YEAH ARE YOU DO YOU LIKE THE HEAT IN THE SUMMER THEN WHEN IT GETS UP IN THE NINETIES AND HUNDREDS
YEAH SO
YEAH JUST KEEP IT THERE
YEAH
WELL I DO TOO I DO TOO AND THAT WAS ONE THING ABOUT THE YEAR AROUND SCHOOL THAT ORIGINALLY WE HAD BEEN SORT OF
NEGATIVE ON IT BUT THEN WE STARTED THINKING ESPECIALLY IN PLANO THE WEATHER IS SO HOT IN AUGUST THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T A LOT THE CHILDREN CAN DO OUTSIDE ANYHOW
STATIC HERE
YEAH
WE DO TOO I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE THE SAME
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH NOW THERE HAVE BEEN WORSE SUMMERS IN FACT THIS MORNING WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH HAROLD TAFT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MILDER
OF THE SUMMERS
AND MILDER FALL EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE YOU CAN TELL SOME OF THE NEWSCASTERS WHEN THEY LIKE THE HEAT BECAUSE THEY'LL TALK ABOUT IT BEING SO GORGEOUS ON THOSE DAYS WHEN WE'RE JUST
MELTING AND THEN YOU CAN TELL WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL WEATHER SOME MORNINGS AND WE'LL IT'LL BE TOO COLD AND THEY'LL SAY WELL THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT LIKE THE COLD WEATHER
OH YEAH HE DID HE DID IT WAS IT WAS REALLY A SHAME HE DIDN'T GO WITH ALL THE GIMMICKS THAT SOME OF THEM DID
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO KEEP ON ABOUT THE WEATHER FOR FIVE MINUTES
OH IS THAT RIGHT OKAY
OH GOOD
BASICALLY ABOUT THE SAME AS WHAT YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD
UM-HUM
OH YOU LIKE THE RAIN DO YOU
UM-HUM
OH ARE YOU I DON'T CARE FOR THAT AS MUCH  I'M A SUMMER PERSON I LIKE THE HEAT
YEAH AND I'M FROM UTAH SO I- I LIKE THE FOUR SEASONS I JUST DON'T LIKE THE COLD
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
THE THING THE OTHER THING IS THE I DON'T LIKE THE RAIN EITHER
WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN THAT ARE IN SPORTS AND SO IT ALWAYS MAKES THEIR GAMES BE POSTPONED FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER ON ON AND ON
SO
I LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
THE THING ABOUT WHEN IT GETS HOT HERE IS I DON'T LIKE THE HUMIDITY THAT I REALLY DON'T CARE FOR THAT
OH REALLY
OH IS THAT RIGHT  WELL ANOTHER REASON WELL I GUESS I CAN'T SAY THAT IT
I DON'T LIKE THE RAIN COMPLETELY WE HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN THAT WE HAVE AND AND SO IT REALLY HELPS OUR GARDEN AND YOU KNOW EVEN I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S BECAUSE PLANTS ARE JUST THAT WAY AND THEY LIKE RAIN OR IT SEEMS THEY THRIVE WHEN IT RAINS THEY JUST REALLY
UM-HUM YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WELL
WELL I LIKE SEVENTIES I LIKE SEVENTIES OKAY
OH I DON'T LIKE NINETIES YOU CAN GIVE ME SEVENTIES AND YOU CAN GIVE ME EIGHTIES AND I'M OKAY BUT WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT THEN IT'S THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT I STAY IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE IT'S JUST
IT'S JUST TOO HOT
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S OKAY UM I'VE I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT TOO AND UM WHEN WE TAKE OUR VACATIONS WE WE DO TAKE THEM IN AUGUST SOMETIMES SO THAT WE CAN BE AWAY FROM HERE
IT JUST REALLY GETS WAY WHEN IT GETS WAY TOO HOT IT'S
AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN HERE YEARS WHEN IT'S BEEN HUNDREDS
AND
YEARS UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH HE HE ALWAYS DID SUCH A GOOD JOB I THOUGHT
A GOOD WEATHERMAN
YEAH
ANYWAY UM
I GUESS IT'S
THAT'S OKAY THEY SAY WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU'RE DONE SO YEAH I YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO SAY Y- CUT OFF YOUR TIME YOU JUST SAY HAVE A GOOD DAY OR WHATEVER YOU SAY YOU TOO
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT SENDING AN ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBER TO A NURSING HOME
UH-HUH
RIGHT
AND WHAT TYPE OF RECOMMENDATIONS DID YOU HAVE WHEN YOU DECIDED WHERE TO PLACE HIM
OH MY
YEAH SO THE CONVENIENCE
RIGHT
MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED WITH US UM UNTIL AUGUST UM AND WE MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME SHE HAS LEUKEMIA
AND HER THE REST OF HER FAMILY AND HER REGULAR DOCTORS AND EVERYBODY SHE TRUSTED AND KNEW WAS IN DAYTON AND WERE SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES AWAY
SO I MADE THE DECISION TO PUT HER IN A NURSING HOME AND MY SISTER BEING ON THE OTHER END FOUND ONE
THAT SHE COULD HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED AN INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITY SHE HAD HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AND DIDN'T HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH ANYONE AND COULD BRING IN HER OWN CHAIR AND TV SET SO
YES AND THAT THE OTHER MAJOR FACTOR IS THAT SHE NEEDS BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS EVERY WEEK TO TEN DAYS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED A DAY OR TWO SO IN THIS FACILITY THEY CAN DO IT RIGHT THERE FROM HER OWN ROOM
SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED BACK AND FORTH SO SHE'S BEEN THERE SINCE AUGUST THE THIRTEENTH AND SEEMS TO HAVE ADJUSTED PRETTY WELL IT'S NOT HER FAVORITE PLACE TO BE IN SHE'D MUCH RATHER BE HERE WITH ME BUT
WHEN IT GOT TO THE POINT I WAS SPENDING MORE TIME AT THE HOSPITAL WITH HER AND I'VE GOT LITTLE CHILDREN HERE WHO NEEDED ME HERE
UM SHE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO WATCH HER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
SO
SHE WAS FALLING DOWN AND HEMORRHAGING AND YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL PROBLEMS SO IT JUST BECAME TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE EVEN THOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD HER STAY WITH HER HEALTH BEING WHAT IT WAS SHE COULDN'T ANYMORE
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YES
WELL I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE GET TO BE A CERTAIN AGE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO KIND OF HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS IT SURE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GRANNY'S DECISION TO LEAVE US AND GO BACK TO A NURSING HOME BUT SHE'S ACCEPTED IT REAL WELL NOW
SO
WELL WE ENJOYED HAVING HER HERE BUT WE FEEL SHE'S MUCH SAFER WHERE SHE IS NOW SHE STILL CONTINUES TO FALL BUT WHEN SHE DOES THERE A NURSE IS RIGHT THERE TO HELP HER
AND I KNOW SHE'S EATING THE RIGHT THINGS AND HER DOCTOR'S RIGHT THERE WHERE HE CAN COME IN AND CHECK ON HER SO
IT BECAME DANGEROUS FOR US TO KEEP TRANSPORTING HER BACK AND FORTH IN THE CAR BECAUSE SHE WAS SO WOBBLY AND NEEDED A WALKER OR A WHEEL CHAIR
SO I THINK SHE'LL ADJUST
SO IT
WELL I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT I THINK THAT AT SOME TIMES IT CAN BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE
SENT MY GRANDFATHER TO A NURSING HOME AT THE POINT WHEN HE WAS REALLY INCAPABLE OF CARING FOR HIMSELF ANYMORE HE ACTUALLY DIED A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT AND SO
AS AT LEAST IN RETROSPECT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE HE
IT WAS EITHER Y- KNOW A NURSING
HOME OR A HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF HIS TIME IN THOSE DAYS
UM WELL THE
SEE UH WELL WE
HE WANTED TO GET INTO A MENNONITE NURSING HOME WHICH IS VERY POPULAR AND HARD TO GET INTO AND HAD LIKE A TEN YEAR WAITING LIST
RIGHT WE WOUND UP JUST CHOOSING A ANOTHER MENNONITE NURSING HOME THAT WAS EASIER TO GET INTO
OR WE NO ACTUALLY NO IT WAS EVEN MENNONITE RELATED I'M SORRY IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT A PARTICULARLY GREAT NURSING HOME MOSTLY
THE THING WAS THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE HE SUDDENLY GOT SICK AND NEEDED TO BE PUT IN
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH THAT'S IMPORTANT I'D SAY
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT SO THAT
RIGHT AND THAT BECOMES DIFFICULT THEN
UM-HUM YEP WE TRIED TO CONVINCE MY GRANDFATHER TO LIVE WITH US AT SEVERAL  POINTS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE
BUT HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TOO PROUD AND TOO
INDEPENDENT SO THAT EVEN THOUGH HIS HEART WAS
GETTING INCREDIBLY WEAK AND HIS KNEES WERE GOING BAD HE
LIVED IN
HIS OWN HOUSE AS LONG AS HE COULD THOUGH HE WAS LIVING ALONE
HAD AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT COULD BARELY MAKE IT UP THE STEPS TO THE UH TOP WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
AND THIS EVENTUALLY
THINGS JUST WENT TOO FAR AND HE
HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PUT INTO A NURSING HOME
RIGHT WELL THAT'S
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY TOO TO THEIR PARENTS AND SUCH TO
HELP DECIDE WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING
AND
UM-HUM
YEP
YOU GO AHEAD AND START TELL ME HOW YOU'D YOU'D ORGANIZE
OKAY THE THINGS THAT CAME ACROSS YOU KNOW THEY SAID TO MAKE IT MEMORABLE MEMORABLE BUT I THOUGHT FIRST OF ALL YOU NEEDED TO
KIND OF ABOUT THE SAME TIME EVERY YEAR LIKE THE SAME WEEK OF THE THE SAME MONTH
AND AND THEN YOU'D HAVE TO SEND OUT
UH YOU KNOW GOOD FLYERS AND THEN MAIL TO ALL THAT YOU WANTED TO ATTEND
AND OF COURSE FOOD AND FUN ARE GOING TO BE YOUR YOUR
WAYS TO GET PEOPLE THERE UM THE ONES THAT I'VE ATTENDED
SOME HAVE HAD BREAKFAST AND LUNCH AND IT'S BEEN A WHOLE DAY AFFAIR SOME  OF COURSE JUST HAVE LUNCH OR
UM ALSO LIKE AT CHRISTMAS TIME IT'D BE A DINNER REUNION
AND
UH ALL KINDS OF EVENTS ARE USUALLY HELD
I'VE SEEN TALENTS FOR  MAINLY THE KIDS THAT ARE THERE AND
YOU NEED PROBABLY INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ANCESTORS TO TIE THAT TIE YOU TO-
WELL WHY DON'T YOU START BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU DON'T MIND
WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE THAT TOPIC
DO YOU I DON'T
NO I'M PRETTY OPINIONATED ABOUT THAT AND MANY OTHER THINGS AS YOU WELL KNOW
I AGREE WITH IT I THINK UH I THINK A COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TEST AT ANY ANY EMPLOYEE ANYTIME THEY SEE FIT
I JUST I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S A PLACE IN OUR EN- ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW IN THE WORK
FORCE FOR DRUGS OR ALCOHOL EITHER
RIGHT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YOU DID UH-HUH
WELL I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND THAT UH BUT NOT BEING A TEACHER AS YOU ARE YOU KNOW I- I WAS NOT QUITE AS SYMPATHETIC AS YOU KNOW AS I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF IF KAY WERE A TEACHER OR SOMETHING
BUT UH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
TH- THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK IT IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH THEM USING DRUGS FROM WHAT YOU READ YOU KNOW BUT UH
YEAH I THINK SO TOO I- I AGREE WITH IT UH I KNOW KAY'S COMPANY YOU KNOW THEY STARTED IT COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
AND SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE EVEN THE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WERE BOY THEY WERE SO AGAINST THEM DOING THAT YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT JEEZ TO ME IT'S QUITE SIMPLE UH
YOU EITHER NEED A JOB OR YOU DON'T THE THE JOB IS WHAT PROVIDES ALL OF YOUR NEEDS
AND UH IF THEY SAY HEY YOU CAN'T DO THIS WORK I'D SAY HEY I AGREE I DON'T I WON'T DO THAT AND I THINK MOST OF THEM HAVE AGREED TO THAT NOW ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT AT FIRST
YEAH I- IT IT IS I CAN SEE WHERE YOU WOULD THINK YEAH THAT IS BELITTLING YOU KNOW I'D PROBABLY FEEL THE SAME WAY
IF I HAD TO DO THAT
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YOU BET OH GOSH THEY W- THEY WOULD REALLY RAISE A STINK IF THAT WAS TO HAPPEN
RIGHT YES I AGREE WITH THAT I I I WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO IT AT ALL IT'S JUST OUR BLEEDING HEART  LIBERALS THAT WOULD
FIGHT IT TOO- TOOTH AND NAIL YOU KNOW
BUT UH  WELL LYNN I'VE ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE'RE SUPPOS- TO CARRY ON A CONVERSATION DO YOU
OH WELL WE'D BETTER KEEP TALKING BECAUSE I'VE NOT HEARD IT HAVE WE HAVE YOU HEARD IT
ANYWAY  SORT OF AGREE ON IT DON'T WE
A- ABOUT RANDOM TESTING
YEAH
IS THAT RIGHT
YOU JUST DON'T THINK OF THAT HAPPENING WITH TEACHERS
I REALLY DON'T I WHEN I THINK OF DRUG TESTING I'M THINKING OF THE
UH YOU KN- OUTSIDE OF EDUCATION
SURE SURE I KNOW THAT BUT UH YOU DON'T THINK OF THAT FIRST HAND NORMALLY
ISN'T THAT
ISN'T THAT MIND BOGGLING GOODNESS IT IT IS IT'S MIND BOGG- AND WELL YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU I KNOW
TEACHERS ARE
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SAME PROBLEMS  THE SAME UH GOOD QUALITIES AS ANYBODY ELSE
YEAH YEAH
Y- YOU THINK THE BENEFIT WOULD BE GREATER THAN THE
UH-HUH
AND THAT WAS IN YOUR CHILDREN'S HIGH SCHOOL ISN'T THAT AMAZING
IF IT IF IT'S IF IT WAS TRUE THERE I'M SURE IT'S TRUE WITH JUST ABOUT PROBABLY TO SOME DEGREE EVERY SCHOOL THERE IS
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A PRETTY GOOD
UH
NO CERTAINLY NOT UH CERTAINLY NOT
UH I DON'T KNOW I'VE GOT MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE TOPIC
NO OKAY
WELL
WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN DRUGS OR ALCOHOL BUT IF YOU'LL REMEMBER WHEN THE TEACHERS HAD TO TAKE THE TCAT
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT DRUG TESTING US
AND WE WERE LAUGHING THAT WE'D HAVE TO GO TO THAT EXAMINATION TO PROVE WE COULD READ AND WRITE WITH A SPECIMEN OF URINE
AND WE FOUND IT BELITTLING
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
BUT THEN YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TOKEN I'M NOT AGAINST BECAUSE I LOOK AT AIRLINE PILOTS
BUS DRIVERS
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT REALLY HAVE OTHER PEOPLES' LIVES IN THEIR HANDS TRUCK DRIVERS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH TRUCK DRIVERS USING DRUGS
AND ALCOHOL
AND
YOU KNOW IN THOSE AREAS I REALLY YOU KNOW DO BELIEVE THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD CLEAN UP OUR
YOU KNOW HOUSE
YEAH I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE A NEW CONCEPT YOU KNOW AS I HAD SAID IF I HAVE TO GO TO A TESTING AREA WITH MY URINE SPECIMEN I WAS INSULTED
BUT AT THE SAME TOKEN IN EDUCATION WE CAN'T DO D- DRUG RANDOM DRUG TESTING ON KIDS
YOU KNOW I MEAN THEIR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED
WHAT WELL BUT WHY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO TEACHERS OR PROFESSIONALS WHY NOT DO THE KIDS
WHEN WE SEE THEM AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW UNDER THE INFLUENCE
THAT'S TRUE
IT'S THREE MINUTES AND THE CLICKER COMES IN WHEN IT'S TIME TO
YEAH NO
Y- WELL DO WE AGREE OR UNLESS IT'S IT'S NOT ME  YOU KNOW HERE WE GO AGAIN I MEAN
YEAH YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT TRUCK DRIVERS AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE EVEN THOUGH TEACHERS HAVE OTHER KIDS LIVES IN THEIR HANDS AND IF THEY COME IN STONED OR THEY COME IN DRUNK
AND THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN MY CHILDREN'S HIGH SCHOOL WHERE A TEACHER STAYED DRUNK
UH-HUH
AND YET
UH WELL NO IT YOU KNOW WE ARE AS SUSCEPTIBLE A SOCIETY AS ANYBODY ELSE
AND UH
YEAH WELL DID YOU HEAR ON THE NEWS WHERE THE TEACHER OF THE YEAR WAS UP FOR CHILD MOLESTATION
IT WAS ON THE NEWS TONIGHT
YEAH
THEN I THINK YOU KNOW IF IT CAME PUSH CAME TO SHOVE I'D PROBABLY BE DRUG TESTED
YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT DOES YOU KNOW
YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS I SAY I'M SITTING THERE FUSSING AND FUSSING AND YET I KNOW OF YOU KNOW ONE TEACHER WHO WAS AN ALCOHOLIC
IN SCHOOL AS WELL AS YOU KNOW I PRESUME OUT
UM-HUM AND YOU KNOW MY CHILDREN BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION I NEVER WAS THERE TO SEE IT
UM-HUM
AND THAT'S NOT GIVING A GOOD EXAMPLE TO STUDENTS
LAWN AND GARDEN WORK AND WHAT YOU ENJOY AND WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DO I'M I'M A PUTTERER I CHOSE THAT TOPIC BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE GARDENING AS FAR AS FLOWERS AND SHRUBS AND JUST KEEPING A PRETTY YARD
OH

UH-HUH
BUT LIKE TODAY IT'S EIGHTY FIVE DEGREES IT'S REALLY STRANGE
BUT THAT'LL CHANGE REAL QUICK  THEN WE'LL WISHED WE'D PLANTED BULBS AND PANSIES ALREADY
OH MY GOSH
WELL TEXAS HAS GOTTEN TO WHERE IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AS FAR AS PLANTS BECAUSE OUR SUMMERS ARE SO TERRIBLY HOT
AND WE HAVE ICE STORMS EVERY YEAR AND THERE JUST AREN'T THAT MANY PLANTS AND SHRUBS THAT CAN TAKE BOTH OF THOSE EXTREMES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT USED TO BE HARDY ARE GETTING TO WHERE THEY DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE TWO SWINGS

WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY UH CHILDREN OR ARE YOU IN COLLEGE
I SEE WELL
CERTAINLY AND WHERE DID YOUR UH CHILDREN GO TO COLLEGE
WELL THAT'S GREAT
I SEE
WELL THAT'S GREAT I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS AT UTD
WELL WHAT ADVICE DID YOU GIVE THEM WHEN THEY WERE CHOOSING THEIR COLLEGES IT LOOKS LIKE THEY UH YOU HAVE A VARIETY THERE
WELL
WELL YOU'RE GOING RIGHT DOWN MY LIST UH THE FIRST THING THAT I ALWAYS TALK TO STUDENTS ABOUT IS THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT ISN'T GONNA DO YOU ANY GOOD NO MATTER HOW BAD YOU WANNA COME HERE
AND UH COST IS ALWAYS UH USUALLY NEXT ON THE LIST ESPECIALLY FOR THE PARENTS AND UH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SCHOLARSHIPS
AND USUALLY THEN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT UH THE SIZE OF THE SCHOOL AND UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT THEY CAN GET INVOLVED IN AND OF COURSE DISTANCE FROM HOME AND SIZE OF CLASSES AND
UM IT SOUNDS LIKE UH FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW HOW TO GO RIGHT DOWN THE LIST WITH THEM
YEAH YOU YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING ESPECIALLY WHEN UH UH MY EXPERIENCE UH HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY
AND UH A LOT OF THE STUDENTS IN THAT HOME TOWN UH SOMETIMES SHUN THE IDEA OF STAYING AND GOING TO SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET SO TO SPEAK
BUT UH IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL I'M GOING TO THIS STATE AND I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND I'M GOING WAY OVER THERE
AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN IT GETS RIGHT DOWN TO THE PRACTICAL ASPECT OF IT THEY END UP STAYING PRETTY DARN CLOSE TO HOME BECAUSE THEY CAN SAVE MONEY AS FAR AS HOUSING AND UH LAUNDRY
YOU BET  IT SURE DOES
SURE
UH I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S A SEVENTH GRADER AND THEN I HAVE A SON THAT'S A SOPHOMORE AT UH SHEPTON HIGH SCHOOL
AND SO IT'S UH IT'S BEEN INTERESTING WATCHING THEM UH SIGN UP FOR APPROPRIATE COURSE WORK AND THINGS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ON THE COLLEGE BOUND TRACK AT LEAST
WELL UH THEY CERTAINLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES BUT UH IN TERMS OF NEEDS THE OLDER SON IS INTERESTED IN THE MEDICAL FIELD
AND UH AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT YOU KNOW TAKING APPROPRIATE COURSE WORK BUT REALLY NOTHING UH THAT'S IN OUT OF THE ORDINARY
AND UH THE DAUGHTER HAS INDICATED THAT UH SHE WANTS TO GET A DEGREE IN UH
BUSINESS UM AND THEN GO ON TO BECOME PRESIDENT  YOU BET AND
WELL I UH YOU KNOW WE'RE WE WE TRY TO BE CONSCIOUS OF UH OF THE UH EQUAL UH EQUAL RIGHTS AND UH
MY GOODNESS THAT'S UNUSUAL
MINE UH WELL MINE ARE GROWN AND UH OF COURSE UH I'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THIS WITH THEM
AND I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO HELP WITH GRANDCHILDREN ONE OF THESE DAYS I HOPE
WELL ONE WENT TO A AND M AND ONE WENT TO UM  UH OH STEPHEN F AUSTIN AND ONE WENT TO NORTH TEXAS AND ONE WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS
AND ONE OF THEM ENDED UP AT EL CENTRO IN ONE OF THE UH SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS AND ANOTHER ONE IS PUTTING HERSELF THROUGH RIGHT NOW BACK AT UTD
OH WELL GOOD WELL I'M GLAD YOU LET HER IN
WELL THE MAIN THING WAS UH WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO STUDY  AND UH WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO GET WHAT YOU NEED AND
HOW FAR IS IT FROM HOME I HAD TO PUT IN AND AND THEN COURSE WE ALSO HAD TO INCLUDE HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL YOU HAVE TO BE PRACTICAL BECAUSE UH I KNOW UM OU- OUR FIRST DAUGHTER WENT UH TO STEPHEN F AUSTIN
AND UH HER ALLERGIES ACTED UP IN THE PINEY WOODS AND IT WAS TOO FAR FROM HOME AND SHE GOT LONESOME AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR HER SO I GUESS I LEARNED ON THAT ONE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
LAUNDRY AND FOOD I THINK FOOD HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT TOO
AND MOTHER DOING THE LAUNDRY  ESPECIALLY WITH THE BOYS THE GIRLS IT DON'T SEEM THE LAUNDRY ISN'T THAT QUITE THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT BETTER BUT THE BOYS IT'S THAT LAUNDRY THAT THROWS THEM THERE FOR A WHILE
EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW HOW TO USE THE WASHING MACHINE
OH
WELL WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE PASS KEY I GUESS DO YOU HAVE UH UH MORE THAN THE ONE DAUGHTER TO PLAN FOR
OKAY
UM-HUM WELL
THAT'S GOOD DO YOU FIND THAT UH THE BOY IS GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN THE GIRL AS FAR AS WHAT HIS UH UM NEEDS ARE AND THE TYPE OF COLLEGE HE WANTS
WELL YEAH
GOOD
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OKAY I'LL VOTE FOR HER IF SHE HAS GOOD TRACK RECORD HOPE I'M AROUND TO DO SO
OKAY VIC OUR TOPIC IS BUDGETS
DO YOU KEEP A MONTHLY BUDGET
UH-HUH
OH HOW INTERESTING
OH
WELL UH IT'S JUST LIKE THE MONEY IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF IT  AS IT GOES OUT
UH I'M A TEACHER AND WE'RE AT A MY HUSBAND AND I ARE AT A STAGE IN LIFE WHERE WE'VE GOT ONE LEFT IN COLLEGE
SO BUDGETING IS NOT OUR PRIORITY SINCE WE HAVE ONE IN COLLEGE  THEIR EXPENSES RUN BEYOND ANY BUDGETING ALLOWANCES
WE'VE QUIT
YEAH
OKAY I SEE I STOPPED THOSE FOUR YEARS AGO YEAH
YEAH OH YEAH NOW WE ARE YOU KNOW UM WELL WE'RE AT A POINT IN LIFE THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO RETIREMENT RATHER THAN YOU KNOW EARNINGS
SO IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE UM YEAH AU- AUTOMATIC TELLER I ONLY HAD THE CARD AND IT WAS ON MY OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNT AND IT GOT WAY OUT OF CONTROL VERY FAST
SO I HAVE A TENDENCY NOW I TAKE AN ALLOWANCE
AND WHEN IT'S GONE IT'S GONE YOU KNOW I'M FINISHED IF IT'S GONE THE FIFTEENTH OF THE MONTH THEN IT'S GONE
AND UH WE HAVE A TENDENCY NOT TO USE CASH WE PAY EVERYTHING BY CHECK
AND SO THAT WAY W- WE KEEP CONTROL OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING WHERE IT'S GOING WHAT IT'S GOING FOR
SO UM YOU KNOW IT I TAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S ALL I TAKE AND YOU KNOW I MEAN I DON'T BUY GROCERIES OUT OF I- IT'S MY OWN LITTLE
SLUSH FUND IF YOU WANNA CALL IT THAT AND THAT'S FOR MY LITTLE INCIDENTALS OR RUNNING TO THE GROCERY STORE TO GET A YOU KNOW GALLON OF MILK OR WHATEVER
BUT UM AFTER THAT IT'S CHECK ONLY
SO WE CAN YOU KNOW REALLY KNOW WHERE OUR MONEY'S GOING AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
WHAT ABOUT HOW ARE YOU ON CHARGE CARDS
GOOD
YES
OKAY
WELL
OKAY YEAH WELL THIS MIGHT HELP YOU BECAUSE SEE MY HUSBAND TRAVELS AS WELL
AND WE HAVE SEPARATE CHARGE ACCOUNTS
HE'S GOT AN AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THAT'S ONLY TRAVELING
THEN WE BOTH HAVE A VISA OR MASTERCARD
SO ANYTHING ON HIS AMERICAN EXPRESS IS HIS
AND IT'S HIS EXPENSE NOW HE GAVE ME ONE AND IF I GO WITH HIM ON WORK
I ONLY CHARGE ON THAT CARD I DON'T PUT IT ON MY MASTERCARD
SO WE'VE SEPARATED THOSE TWO COMPLETELY AND I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BECAUSE AT FIRST WE USED TO INTERMINGLE OUR FUNDS AND WE WEREN'T SURE  WHY OUR BILLS WERE OUTRAGEOUS
YES
UH I TALK ABOUT DOING THAT A LOT
UH I- I USE A UH COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL EXPENSES PRIMARILY IT'S A CHECKING
YOU KNOW A CHECK BALANCING PROGRAM BUT IT DOES CATEGO- CATEGORIZE EVERYTHING
A- AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO EITHER TO GO IN AND CREATE A BUDGET AND THEN COMPARE AGAINST IT OR ACTUALLY WILL SORT OF GENERATE ONE BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW YOU CATEGORIZE THINGS OVER THE OVER THE MONTHS
SO I HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THERE UM IT'S JUST THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN VERY DILIGENT AT AT REALLY TRACKING IT AND FOLLOWING IT
RIGHT RIGHT WHAT DO YOU DO
OKAY
UM-HUM
RIGHT
O- OKAY
UM WELL THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT I'VE HAD OR ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS UM
KEEPING TRACK OF CASH E- YOU KNOW EXPENDITURES
UH I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S UH MAKES BUDGETING VERY HARD IS THE CONVENIENCE OF AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINES
UH THE ABILITY TO GO UP AND GET CASH SO EASILY
REALLY
OKAY WELL SEE YOU HAVE CONTROL
UM-HUM
OKAY
HUH
WELL THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
UH-HUH
IT'S GONE HUH OH THAT'S GREAT
RIGHT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT
UM-HUM WELL THAT'S GREAT
OH WOW
UM-HUM YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UH PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THAT THA- THE LAST FEW YEARS ANYWAY WE DID HAVE A MASTER CARD THAT GOT OUT OF HAND FOR AWHILE BUT WE JUST JUST STOPPED USING IT DIDN'T GET RID OF IT
THERE ARE TIMES UH SUCH AS OH SOME MAIL ORDER TYPE THINGS UH WHERE IT'S VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE
UH BUT THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY THING IT IT'S USED FOR AND UH ONE ONE PROBLEM I DO HAVE IS WITH UH
IS IT I IN MY JOB I TRAVEL A GOOD BIT AND HAVE TO USE MY OWN UH CREDIT CARD I DON'T HAVE A BUSINESS CREDIT CARD
SO I USE THAT AND THEN HAVE TO FILE EXPENSE REPORTS AND UH
IT JUST ADDS ANOTHER COMPLICATION TO PROPERLY TRACKING EXPENSES KNOWING HOW MUCH OF IT IS REIMBURSED BUSINESS EXPENSE
UH OR HOW MUCH IS MY OWN EXPENSE FOR
YEAH I- I USE UH CREDIT CARDS NOT FOR CREDIT BUT J- FOR CONVENIENCE IN OTHER WORDS I PAY WE PAY MONTHLY THE BALANCE DUE UH BUT WE DO
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO DO IT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OKAY
RIGHT
UM-HUM
OH YEAH IT'S HARD TO BE S- TO BE SURE
RIGHT
OKAY WHEN THEY FIRST SAID THE SUBJECT MY MIND WENT KIND OF BLANK I THOUGHT GEE I HAVEN'T TAKEN ANYTHING BACK FOR A LONG TIME
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UM-HUM
OF COURSE  UH-HUH
RIGHT RIGHT JUST TO GET YOU BY FIVE YEARS AND THEN YOU'LL THROW IT AWAY RATHER THAN HAVE IT FIXED WE'RE WE'RE A WASTEFUL SOCIETY FOR SURE
RIGHT
RIGHT AND YOU USUALLY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT WE BOUGHT SOME WALKIE-TALKIES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEY WERE LIKE TEN DOLLARS AND WE EXPECTED THEM  TO WORK NICE FOR THE LITTLE KIDS AND
THEY DIDN'T WORK WORTH ANYTHING  SO WE TOOK THOSE BACK AND THAT'S ABOUT THAT ALL THAT I CAN REMEMBER TAKING BACK IN AGES SO
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
OH REALLY
IT'S HARD
OH WOW
UM-HUM AND IT'S JUST A PAIN TO HA- DEAL WITH
I AT FIRST I THOUGHT OF FOOD YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAINLY WHAT I BUY IT SEEMS LIKE AND UH YOU KNOW I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY ANYTHING TO DO THERE BUT
BUT I I THINK TOO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T BUY THEIR WARRANTIES EITHER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WHEN IT'S THAT OLD THEY'RE GOING TO BUY A NEW ONE
SO
YEAH MY HUSBAND IS REALLY GOOD AT FIXING THINGS TOO SO HE'LL USUALLY BE ABLE TO FIX ANYTHING THAT'S MINOR AND
AND THAT HAS SAVED US THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS  YOU KNOW FROM PLUMBING TO MECHANIC TO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT
BUT IT WAS INTERESTING TO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE MAKING THEM BETTER OR NOT I IT'S HARD TO SAY SOME I THINK THEY MAKE MORE OF THEIR PARTS PLASTIC WHICH YOU KNOW MAKE THINGS BREAK EASIER BUT I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY'S BETTER
THAT QUALITY
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
RIGHT WELL PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO PAY THOSE PRICES VERY OFTEN SO YOU KNOW FOR A HANDCRAFTED SOMETHING SO
WELL I HAVEN'T EITHER UH I I HATE RETURNING THINGS I MEAN I HA- I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IF SHE LIKES SOMETHING ISN'T SURE WHAT SIZE SOMEBODY MIGHT NEED WILL BUY IT IN EVERY COLOR AND SIZE AND
YOU KNOW TAKE EVERYTHING BACK AGAIN IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A GAME TO HER BUT I I DO NOT LIKE TO DO THAT I CONSIDER IT KIND OF A A WASTE OF MY TIME AND SO I'M USUALLY
UH PRETTY CAREFUL WHEN I SHOP AND I ALSO YOU KNOW USUALLY HAVE HAVE CHECKED OVER THINGS YOU KNOW IF IT'S LIKE AN APPLIANCE OR SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE UM
IT HAS THE FEATURES IN IT THAT I WANT NOW WE'VE HAD ONE LATELY UM
OH A UH A DUSTBUSTER PLUS THAT WE BOUGHT AND WE'VE HAD IT FOR A WHILE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN IT JUST WASN'T WORKING AND
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A PART MISSING FROM IT MY HUSBAND OPENED IT UP AND WHATEVER AND OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RECEIPT ANY MORE SO WE CAN'T TAKE IT BACK UH UH BUT
I- I THINK A LOT OF GOODS ARE MADE NOT TO LAST REAL LONG
UH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S TRUE AND LOT OF TIMES THOUGH IT IS IT COSTS SO MUCH TO GET SOMETHING FIXED THAT YOU ALMOST ARE JUST AS WELL OFF BUYING ANOTHER ONE YOU KNOW IF IT'S OH
UM-HUM
WELL YEAH I THINK A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU GET A BRAND NAME UH YOU KNOW IF IT'S A A GOOD BRAND I YOU I THINK THERE'S THERE CAN BE A LEMON IN ANYTHING
BUT UH I THINK MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YOU YOU PRETTY WELL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AHEAD OF TIME AND UH
YOU KNOW IF IF YOU BUY A GOOD ONE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY YOU KNOW TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM WITH IT I MEAN WE WE HAD A CAR ONCE THAT WE TRIED TO HAVE DECLARED A LEMON UNDER THE LEMON LAW
WHICH IS EX-
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO WE NEVER COULD GET IT DECLARED A LEMON AND THE CAR WOULD GO AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHAT SO EVER YOU COULD BE GOING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT SIXTY AND IT WOULD STOP
AND I THERE WAS JUST YOU KNOW AND OH WE WENT ROUND AND ROUND WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND AND EVERYTHING AND THEY GOT IT FINALLY SEMIFIXED BUT IT WAS SUCH A HASSLE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH IT IT REALLY IS UH
BUT GEE  THIS IS OF ALL THE TOPICS I HAVE HAD I'M DOING THIS THING THIS IS KIND OF THE STRANGEST ONE
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK THAT'S TRUE AND I UH NOW WE GENERALLY DON'T BUY A WARRANTY BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU KNOW AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS NOTHING SHOULD GO WRONG WITH IT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YE- I THINK TECHNOLOGY IS BETTER I'M I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD POINT WITH THE PLASTIC AND THAT I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT THINGS ARE BEING MADE BETTER UH
YOU KNOW I I EVERYTHING IS SO AUTOMATED UH AND THINGS CAN BE MADE WITHOUT I THINK A HUMAN HAND EVER TOUCHING IT YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK UH THAT CERTAINLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE FROM
BACK FROM THE TIME WHEN SOMEBODY HAND CRAFTED SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT
WELL YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE
UH DID YOU HEAR I GUESS YOU HEARD THE SUBJECT RIGHT
RIGHT WELL I TELL YOU I'M ABOUT A MAGAZINE JUNKIE SO THIS IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY

AND SHE SAID WELL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THERE WAS JUST ONLY A HANDFUL OF BASIC PRODUCTS YOU COULD MAKE COSMETICS OUT OF ANYWAY SO THEY WERE NEARLY ALL PRETTY SIMILAR
RIGHT
FOR THE PACKAGING
SO UH AND THAT ALWAYS STOOD OUT IN MY MIND AND I REALLY BUY A LOT OF CHEAP UH LIPSTICKS AND I THINK THEY'RE JUST AS PRETTY AND THEY LAST AS LONG AS THE REAL EXPENSIVE ONES
RIGHT YEAH THAT'S WHAT I HAVE
OH THAT'S RIGHT I FORGOT I WONDER WHO HAS TO LISTEN TO ALL THIS GARBAGE

IT IS IT'S DIFFICULT WELL LET'S SEE YOU YOU HAVE ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT OH I SUBSCRIBED TO AT ONE TIME AND HAVEN'T FOR SOME TIME BUT I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING IS CONSUMER REPORTS
DO YOU GO A-
WELL DO YOU ACTUALLY ACT ON ANY OF THE UH TIPS THAT THEY GIVE YOU
YES
IT'S ONE I PROBABLY OUGHT TO RESUBSCRIBE TO YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE GETTING READY TO BUY SOME KIND OF A MAJOR PRODUCT
BUT IT'S INTERESTING EVEN WITH THE EVERYDAY YOU KNOW LIKE THE SHAMPOOS AND ALL UM THEY HAD ONE I RECALL NOT TOO MANY YEARS AGO THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS BRANDS OF SHAMPOOS AND HOW UH
YEAH AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES WERE NOT THE ONES THAT THEY RECOMMENDED
UH-HUH
I KIND OF HAVE HEARD THAT TOO BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO PAY UH FOR THE BRAND TO FEEL GLAMOROUS OR WHATEVER UH-HUH EXACTLY
WELL I ONLY DO MAYBELLINE MASCARA BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE BEST
I DON'T KNOW IT'S GOT TO BE A BORING JOB
AH I WAS IN THE PROJECT OH MAYBE SIX OR EIGHT MONTHS AGO AH AND THEN OH I MADE MAYBE FIVE SIX SEVEN AND THEN THEY HAD SOME PROBLEMS ON THE SYSTEM AND I JUST KIND OF GOT OUT OF IT AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE SINCE THEY BROUGHT IT BACK UP AGAIN THAT I HAVE DONE
BUT UM FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY GET PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT I- I
OH
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ANYONE OUTSIDE THE DALLAS AREA
YEAH

WELL IT HELPS US WITH OUR FIVE DOLLARS A CALL

WELL THAT'S FUN
NO JUST A FRIEND OF MINE AH INTRODUCED ME TO IT

I DO TOO I THINK THEY'RE GREAT
WELL IF YOU DO NOTHING ELSE WITH THEM I TEAR THEM OUT OF THE BOOKS AND PUT THEM IN MY LINGERIE DRAWERS OR SOMETHING
SURE
OKAY UM
I'M VERY UNHANDY IN THESE THINGS AND UH I DON'T LIKE TO DO ANYTHING MYSELF
I LIKE TO HAVE A SERVICE STATION
I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT
WHICH IS PROBLEMATICAL
UM-HUM
OH IS IT IS THE PROBLEM THAT IT'S HARD TO GET THE APPROPRIATE BATTERY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS FOR A SIXTY SIX CAR
IS DO YOU RELY ON THIS CAR FOR FOR PRIMARY TRANSPORTATION OR JU- -CUSE ME
I'M SORRY
SO  ARE YOU STRUGGLING TO GET AROUND AS A RESULT
I TRY NOT TO UM
I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO LEARN TO CHANGE THE OIL AND THINGS I CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY DOING THAT
TALK CONFIDENTLY WITH PEOPLE WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT SOMEWHERE TO GET PARTS OR WHATEVER
WAS IT EASY TO GET
A MORE APPROPRIATE CLUTCH
YOU HAVE A SLIGHT
OH
UM
WELL
THE CAR I DROVE IS AN EIGHTY FOUR AND IT'S REACHED THE POINT
WHERE VARIOUS THINGS ARE ARE GOING WRONG WITH IT AND IT'S HAD TO BE IN RECENTLY
IT NEEDED A NEW BATTERY IT WOULDN'T START UM
MY WIFE AND I DID MANAGE TO TO UH RECHARGE THE BATTERY FROM THE OTHER CAR UM AND THE EXHAUST SYSTEM HAS NEEDED WORK AND UM
UH SO  THE LATEST WORK DONE IT JUST YESTERDAY WAS TO HAVE THE FRONT WHEELS ALIGNED
UH SO WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
IN FACT ON THE BATTERY UH
UH IT'S THE OLD ONE IT HAD A FOUR YEAR WARRANTY AND THE DAY IT GAVE UP WAS FOUR YEARS AND SIX DAYS
UH
YEAH
YEAH I UH
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY CAR SINCE OR ACTUALLY ON ON CARS SINCE I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FOURTEEN
UH I'VE I'VE GOT A SIXTY SIX MUSTANG OUT IN THE BACK THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET RUNNING HERE LATELY THAT'S GIVEN ME A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND TH- THE CLUTCH AND STUFF ISN'T WORKING OUT RIGHT
AND EVERY TIME I TRY TO PUT THE BATTERY IN IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHARGE ON IT SO I HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND GET IT CHARGED UP AGAIN T- TRY IT AGAIN IT RAINED HERE ALL LAST WEEK SO I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO DO IT
UH NO IT'S NOT  EVERY TIME I CHARGE IT UP IT IT HAS TO SIT
I I I WENT AND GOT A NEW BATTERY AND BROUGHT IT HOME AND THEN IT SAT THERE FOR TWO WEEKS SO I WENT OVER TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND CHARGED IT UP
AND THEN IT STARTED RAINING SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT FOR ANOTHER WEEK SO I'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER THERE AND GET IT CHARGED AGAIN AND MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IF THAT WON'T GET IT GOING TOMORROW
BUT UH
BUT MY MAIN PROBLEM'S BEEN MY CLUTCH I
I SAI- I SAID I'M SUPPOSED TO
IT UH IT'S BEEN DOWN FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW AND I BEEN HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH IT
YEAH I HAVE TO RELY ON FRIENDS AND PARENTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO YOU YOU DON'T DO ANY KIND OF CAR WORK OR
TRY NOT TO ANYWAY YEAH
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
YEAH I THINK
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I IT'S NOT THE MOST FUN IN THE WORLD BUT
IT IT LIKE YOU SAID IT IS IT IS CHEAPER ON YOURSELF TO TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT YOURSELF THAN GO SPEND FIFTY SIXTY DOLLARS TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE YOU KNOW JUST CHANGE YOUR OIL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT MY NEXT OPTION IS IF THE IF THE CLUTCH DOESN'T WORK RIGHT TO TAKE IT TO SOMEBODY AND SEE IF THEY CAN'T DECIPHER WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
I I HAVE A FEELING MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT I'VE I'VE PUT TOO STRONG OF A CLUTCH IN IT BECAUSE I'VE GOT IT'S A IT'S A STRAIGHT SIX TWO HUNDRED WITH A THREE SPEED TRANSMISSION IN IT
AND I'VE TRIED TO PUT A RACING CLUTCH IN IT WHICH I THINK IS GONNA YOU KNOW I THINK THAT MAY BE WHAT MY PROBLEM IS IT'S IT'S TOO MUCH CLUTCH FOR THE AMOUNT OF ENGINE I'VE GOT
BUT UH
WE'LL SEE
PARDON
YEAH IT'S IT I JUST GO TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD PARTS STORE AND GET ANOTHER ONE IT'S THAT WHEN I WHEN I HAD TO RE- EN- ENGINE REBUILT I DECIDED TO TRY A UM A BETTER CLUTCH SO THAT I'D QUIT CHANGING THEM OUT EVERY SIX MONTHS
I I HAVE A SLIGHT LEAD FOOT
A SLIGHT LEAD FOOT YES
IT MEA- IT MEANS I'VE ALWAYS GOT MY FOOT IN THE GAS AN- AND AND THE OTHER ONE IN THE IN THE CLUTCH SO I I BURN UP THE CLUTCH A LOT
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR IT
BUT UH
ANY ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT UH ANYTH- ANYTHING EASY TO TO WORK ON OR WHATEVER OR ARE YOU TRYING TO GET YOURSELF INTO WORKING ON CARS OR WHAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DON'T DON'T DON'T TELL ME LET ME GUESS YOUR WARRANTY JUST RAN OUT AND NOW EVERYTHING GOES WRONG RIGHT
TYPICAL  I I D- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS SOMEHOW ANOTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS AND THE MANUFACTURERS OF NEW PARTS FOR THEM
AH I GUESS MY PERSONAL OPINION I- I DON'T MIND PAYING TAXES NECESSARILY I I JUST SOMETIMES WONDER IF OUR MONEY'S BEING USED IN THE BEST WAY
AH SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR WHAT WHAT THEY'RE EVEN WHA- EVEN WHAT THE POLITICIANS ARE MAKING YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THEY'RE GETTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS BENEFITS AND THAT AH
I THINK THAT'S JUST A BIT TOO MUCH TO BE PAYING THEM AH
AND THAT'S ALL TAX MONEY WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT HOW MANY POLITICIANS AND EACH ONE GETTING THAT MUCH IT'S JUST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT'S I THINK IS JUST BEING THROWN AWAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WELL I- I KNOW ANYTIME THERE'S THERE'S A BIG UH UH BUDGET CUT YOU KNOW I WORK WITH THE STATE AND ANYTIME THERE'S THERE IS A BUDGET CUT OR CRUNCHES IT'S ALWAYS THE SMALL GUY THAT THAT GETS HURT
IT'S NEVER THE UH THE PERSON THAT'S MAKING A HUNDRED THOUSAND THERE IT'S ALWAYS THE PERSON THAT'S MAKING THE LEAST AMOUNT AND
AH AND AN- SOMETIMES WE'RE RUNNING AROUND THERE I SEE THESE THESE AH
AH SUPERVISORS RUNNING AROUND AH HAVING MEETINGS I- I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO I SOMETIMES WONDER ARE ARE THEY REALLY DOING ANYTHING OR
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THEY GOT SO MANY HIDDEN TAXES THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH YOU ARE PAYING BECAUSE GO TO A GROCERY STORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU'RE PAYING A LITTLE TAX HERE AND YOU
SO YEAH GAS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS I BUT THERE'S PROBABLY AT LEAST ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO TO THIRTY CENTS OF DIFFERENT TAXES ON ON OUR GAS
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE IT
YEAH
YEAH WELL I KNOW THEY SAY LIKE  WITH REAGAN THEY SAY NO NEW TAXES BUT THEY CHANGED THE AH DEDUCTIONS ON YOU AND THAT JUST RAISES YOUR TAXES YOU KNOW THEY JUST GET IT A DIFFERENT WAY
SO I MEAN TO ME IT DID UH RAISE MY TAXES
YEAH I- I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT UH
IF THEY WOULD JUST SOMETHING ABOUT UH WITH THE UH
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT AND THEN WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THAT THEY'RE SPENDING ALL THE MONEY ON YOU KNOW THESE STUDIES THAT HAVE NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER
THAT KIND OF TICKS YOU OFF TOO BUT UH
SOMEBODY SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME THE OTHER DAY THAT THEY HEARD
SOME SENATOR SAY THAT
WHAT WE'RE PAYING
IT'S NOT THAT WE MIND PAYING TAXES IT'S THAT WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR A LOUSY GOVERNMENT
AND I- I- I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT I'M NOT REALLY INTO
WHAT THEY'RE DOING PER SE AND I THINK THERE'S JUST TOO MANY TOO MANY LEVELS OF BUREAUCRACY
I THINK IT CAN BE
CAN BE MANAGED BY
BY LESS AH
LESS LEVELS
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT WELL I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE
A STREAMLINING IN THE GOVERNMENT
I JUST YOU KNOW I- I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF UH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT LEVEL OR WHAT HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE FOR YOU KNOW OUR COUNTRY TO START
THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL TO START SAYING HEY THIS IS TOO MUCH WE'RE NOT GONNA PAY ANYMORE
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA PAY FOR THIS AND YOU'RE OUT YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IT A LITTLE BIT NOW BUT I THINK UH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF
INPUT WE'RE GONNA GET FROM THE PUBLIC AND HOW THEY'RE GONNA GO ABOUT DOING IT
BECAUSE I THINK I THINK WE'RE JUST GETTING TAXED WAY TOO MUCH
I MEAN RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING TAXED PROBABLY
PROBABLY AROUND THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OR MORE AND THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ME NOT MAKING A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY
WE-
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH WE GOT A SALES TAX OUR SALES TAX IS LIKE EIGHT PERCENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR GAS TAX IS I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND
TWENTY FIVE CENTS A GALLON
SO
I MEAN THEY'RE HITTING US UP AND THEY MAY NOT
THEY MAY NOT RAISE IT
YOU KNOW FEDERALLY AS MUCH ONE YEAR BUT THEN THEY'LL RAISE IT SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE OR THE OR THE SALES TAX OR PROPERTY TAX OR WHATEVER
IT'S JUST
I MEAN
YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE MONEY IS JUST NOT GOING THAT FAR
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL
I MEAN YOU CAN TELL JUST BY
JUST BY HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE LEFT OVER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S EATING ME ALIVE

THE FIRST MONTH THAT WE WERE HERE AND
OF COURSE EVERYBODY TAKES CREDIT CARDS SO

UM-HUM
WELL THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSES IT UH YOU KNOW IT'S A AN INSUFFICIENCY IN THE BRAIN
YEAH BUT UH
SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T UH THAT I KNOW OF THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHY THERE'S A DEFICIENCY AND
THE MEDICINE THEY GIVE THEM IS SUPPOSED TO REPLACE IT BUT IT IT DOESN'T
IT ALSO HAS SIDE AFFECTS
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING TO PLACE SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME
UM-HUM
HM WELL WELL
I THINK ANOTHER PART OF IT IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU ARE UH PHYSICALLY ABLE TO DO IT
TO GIVE THEM THE CARE THEY NEED
WELL AND THEN TOO UH I FOUND THAT EVEN IF I DIDN'T WORK
I COULDN'T HOLD UP TO TAKING CARE OF MOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
BECAUSE
IT JUST UH
UH YOU KNOW SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BY HERSELF AND UH
HER MIND WONDERS AND SHE WONDERS
AND UH I'VE TRIED IT ON WEEKENDS AND STUFF AND
I
MY FEELING ON IT
IS THAT THE NURSING HOME IS THERE IF YOU NEED IT
BUT YOU HOPE YOU DON'T NEED IT
AND I THINK YOUR HEALTH IS IMPOR- AS IMPORTANT AS THEIRS
UM HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT UH KIND OF THINGS YOU WOULD LOOK FOR IN A NURSING HOME IF YOU EVER HAD TO CHOOSE

THEY LOVE THE THE OLDER PEOPLE LOVE TO BE AROUND CHILDREN TOO
ISN'T THAT GREAT
YEAH THAT'S GREAT
UH-HUH
COURSE THERE'S A
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK THE WOR- WORST THING ABOUT HAVING TO DO IT IS THE GUILT YOU DO FEEL
AND I THINK THE FIRST THING IS YOU HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
AND UH
I KNOW
I- IN MY SITUATION WE HAD TO CONSIDER NURSING CARE AND UH
THE DOCTOR AVAILABLE AND THE FACT THAT IT'S CLEAN AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO UH PAY ATTENTION TO HOW MUCH IT COSTS TOO
UM-HUM IT IT CAN AND IT COSTS MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE MAKE IN A YEAR
BUT UH
THERE IS A SPECIAL INSURANCE YOU CAN BUY
FOR NURSING HOME INSURANCE IN FACT MY HUSBAND AND I TAKE IT
BECAU- WE HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT
BUT UH IT WOULD UH
TAKE CARE OF AN INTERIM PERIOD UNTIL YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A LONG-TERM CARE UNTIL MEDICAID WOULD KICK IN
BECAUSE MEDICAI- UH PARDON
YES I HAVE FOUR
UM-HUM BUT UH
WELL UM

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL I HOPE I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY PARENTS SOMEDAY I HOPE I CAN AFFORD TO

UM I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE NURSING HOME'S LIKE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME VERY NICE ONES THAT I WOULDN'T MIND CHECKING INTO IT MYSELF
AND
UH-HUH

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN OR
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN
UM-HUM
SO YOU HAVE UM PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU SOME DAY
LET ME ASK YOU DO YOU THINK THE SOVIET UNION IS A STILL A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
WELL I THINK THERE'S A
A STRUGGLE WITHIN THE SOVIET UNION UM
I THINK  THE PEOPLE ARE ARE JUST FED UP AND I THINK IT'S SHOWING IN ALL THE REPUBLICS TRYING TO GAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE
AND I THINK UH  THAT'S MAKING GORBACHEV AND OTHERS REALIZE THAT
HEY MAYBE THIS COMMUNIST THING ISN'T WORKING
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT I THINK
WELL THAT THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT I WE ALWAYS WE THINK OF THE KGB AND WE THINK SUCH BAD THINGS YOU KNOW BUT I WOULDN'T DOUBT IF THE SOVIET PEOPLE THINK CIA AND THEY THINK SUCH BAD THINGS YOU KNOW
EXAC- EXACTLY THEY DO
OH YEAH THEY DO YOU KNOW
OH YEAH OH ABSOLUTELY THAT'S PART OF THAT PROPAGANDA THING AND I THINK IF WE CAN GET AWAY FROM THAT OR IF WE CAN KEEP THAT OUT OF OUR MINDS  AH EXCUSE ME I'VE GOT A COLD TODAY
THANK YOU UM
I THINK IF WE CAN GET THAT PROPAGANDA THING BECAUSE I'M SURE BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SEEING SEEING IT YOU KNOW THINKING KGB AND CIA AND ALL THAT BUT UH
JUST ON AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW IF THE SOVIET UNION DOESN'T DO SOMETHING FAST THEY'RE THEY AIN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO FEED THEIR PEOPLE THIS THIS WINTER YOU KNOW BUT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I'M KIND OF GETTING FED UP WITH UH OUR OWN COUNTRY AND PRESIDENCY AH ALWAYS  CONCERNING THEMSELVES
WITH OTHER NATIONS' PROBLEMS WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY AT HOME YET
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT UH
WE'VE GOT QUITE A FEW DOMESTIC PROBLEMS THAT UH
THAT I FEEL WE OUGHT TO BE CONCENTRATING MORE ON I THINK THE PROBLEM IS AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCOPE
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT FEELS THAT UH
YOU KNOW FOR LONG TERM RELATIONS WITH ALL THESE COUNTRIES IT'S IMPORTANT AND WELL WE'LL AL- WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE THE UNITED STATES AND YOU KNOW WE NEED TO SOLVE THESE INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS BUT UM
I'VE THINK I HEARD IN THE NEWS ABOUT LAST WEEK SOMETIME THAT UH
THE PRESIDENT ENDED UP CANCELING ONE OF HIS INTERNATIONAL TRIPS SO HE COULD SPEND MORE TIME ON THEM ON A
DOMESTIC ISSUE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC'S KIND OF GETTING FED UP WITH IT
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEP NO
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
WELL I THINK UH
DO YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK I I
THE PERSON I AM I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S AN HONEST EFFORT I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY REALLY ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT THAT MAYBE THEY ARE HEADED FOR A MORE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND I I WANT TO BELIEVE IT'S ALL OKAY
BUT THEN THERE'S THAT SIDE OF ME THAT SAYS  YEAH BUT THEY'VE PUT ON FACES BEFORE
AND NEVER TO THIS EXTENT THOUGH YOU KNOW SO SO IT'S LIKE THERE IS A STRUGGLE WITHIN ME GOING DO DO I BE OPEN MINDED AND GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WHICH IS KIND OF MY BASIC PERSONALITY YOU KNOW I I TRUST PEOPLE I'LL DO THAT
OR DO I KEEP ON GOING WELL WE'LL WAIT AND SEE
YEAH THAT IT'S NOT JUST AMER- UH OR WESTERN SOCIETY TELLING YOU I- IT'S IT DOESN'T WORK
YOU KNOW  THEY'VE ALWAYS SAID YOU KNOW THE THE SOVIET PEOPLE WERE UNITED WE BELIEVE THIS AND MAYBE THEY'RE SEEING THAT NO NO HEY WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS YOU KNOW
BUT IT'S STILL YOU KNOW I GUESS I KEEP THAT ONE PART OF ME THAT'S LIKE WELL
I DON'T KNOW I WANT TO TRUST THEM AND I IT'S LIKE I CAN'T AND MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR OWN PROPAGANDA OVER THE YEARS I DON'T KNOW
AND THEY PROBABLY DO THE SAME THINGS
YOU THINK THE CIA DOESN'T SPY I'M SURE THEY DO
NOW THE DIFFERENCE IS WE DON'T I DO- I DON'T THINK WE TAKE PEOPLE AND KILL THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW I THINK TO THAT EXTENT WE DON'T GO AS FAR BUT I'M SURE THEY LIE
YOU KNOW

UH-HUH THEY WERE AWARE THAT THAT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I GUESS THERE IS THAT IN THOSE SCARY MOVIES THERE'S DEFINITELY THE ELEMENT OF UH CAUTION
YOU KNOW I- I WOULD LIKE THAT AS WELL I- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THAT AND I HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S UM  I THINK IT'S AT NO- NOT THE WAREHOUSE BUT UH
YEAH YEAH BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO THAT'S THE ONE THAT I THINK I HEARD THAT IT WAS
OH THAT'S GREAT
NO I- I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT FOREIGN FILMS HAVE YOU SEEN ANGEL AT MY TABLE
UH OH IT'S KIND OF LIKE MY LEFT FOOT IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THAT IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THAT YOU KNOW IT FOCUSES ON AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS
WELL IN IN HER CASE SHE'S VERY VERY SHY
UM AND THAT'S NOT A PHYSICAL DISABILITY BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DISABILITY IN HER CASE AND IT IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW SHE BLOSSOMS AND AND ABOUT HER HER HER DEVELOPMENT
UH-HUH UM ANOTHER ONE THAT I REALLY LIKED WAS CALLED TRULY MADLY DEEPLY
I BELIEVE IT'S A BRITISH FILM AS WELL AND IT CAME WELL THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE THE- THEY TEND TO YOU KNOW SHOW UP IN SAN FRANCISCO SO
THERE ARE A COUPLE THEATERS THAT USUALLY SHOW GOOD ONES YOU CAN COUNT ON THEM TO SHOW FOREIGN FILMS THAT YOU YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT ENJOY AS OPPOSED TO SOME THAT ARE SO ECLECTIC THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY RELATE TO THEM
AND UM TRULY MADLY DEEPLY IS A LOVE STORY ABOUT A PERSON'S LET'S SEE IT'S HER HUSBAND THAT DIES IT CAME OUT SHORTLY AFTER GHOST
SO UM I- I KIND OF I KI- RELATED TO IT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT IT WAS ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S LOVE AND HER LOVE BEING SO STRONG THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SORT OF
CONVERSE WITH HER AFTER HE DIED IN SUCH A WAY TO KIND OF HELP HER MAKE THE SEPARATION FROM HIS DEATH BECAUSE SHE WAS HAVING REALLY HARD TIME GRIEVING FOR LIKE A YEAR OR SO AFTER HIS DEATH AND
TRULY MADLY DEEPLY
UH-HUH THAT'S HOW TH- THEY USED TO HAVE A A A GAME ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LOVED EACH OTHER THEY'D LOVED EACH OTHER TRULY NO TRULY MADLY NO TRULY MADLY DEEPLY
YEAH IT'S A SWEET FILM IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A A SPOOF ON LIFE AFTER DEATH BECAUSE
HE NOT ONLY COMES BACK TO VISIT HER AND HELP HER MAKE THE TRANSITION AFTER HIS DEATH BUT HE BRINGS ALL OF HIS HIS FRIENDS AND A LOT OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW PLAYING CARDS IN HER HOUSE AND
JAMMING ON MUSICAL INSTRUMENT IT IT'S PRETTY IT'S PRETTY FUNNY
UM HOT SHOT
DO I RECYCLE CANS THAT'S ABOUT IT
YEAH MY SO-
NO BECAUSE THERE'S NO REALLY PLACE I THINK IF THEY HAD MORE VISIBLE PLACES FOR YOU TO DROP STUFF
PEOPLE WOULD DO IT MORE INSTEAD OF TRY- YOU KNOW IT'S BECAUSE IT'S HARD IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU GOT TO SAVE THE STUFF BUT THEN YOU GOT TO GO FIND SOMEWHERE TO PUT IT IF THEY
NONE OF IT  I MEAN SEE AT AT WORK ALL I DO IS PAPER AND TRASH AND CANS
AND THEN AT HOME I JUST SAVE CANS BECAUSE I I KNOW WHERE THAT IS THAT'S LIKE ON THE WAY TO WORK BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PAPER AND THE THE BOTTLES AND ALL THAT STUFF IS BUT I THINK IF LIKE APARTMENT COMPLEXES
HO-
HOW MANY KIDS YOU GOT
OH
UH-HUH
UH

OH I KN- YEAH MY HUSBAND MY HUSBAND HAULS APPLES

GET TO IT YOU KNOW LIKE IN DIFFERENT PLACES LIKE APARTMENT COMPLEXES THEY GOT TRASH CANS WHY NOT PUT THE DUMPSTERS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AND UH AND AND THAT WAY PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT BETTER
BUT IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT
WHO'S GONNA SAVE IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE AFTER A WHILE YOU GET TIRED OF SAVING NEWSPAPERS I MEAN
UM-HUM
UH-HUH

THEY USE GLOVES FOR EVERYBODY I MEAN THE THE NURSE YOU THE THE DENTIST HIS ASSISTANT EVERYBODY IN THERE HAS ON GLOVES AND AND THEN

NOW I DIDN'T USE THOSE I HAD A A DIAPER SERVICE
IN THE SERVICE BECAUSE I COULDN'T MY SON WAS ALLERGIC TO SOMETHING IN THE PLASTIC
SO I HAD  SO IT WASN'T BY CHOICE
THAT I COULDN'T USE THEM IT'S JUST HE COULDN'T WEAR THEM FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
BUT HE COULDN'T WEAR THEM BECAUSE OF THE SOMETHING WAS HE WAS ALLERGIC TO SOMETHING
SO I HAD TO PUT REGULAR DIAPERS ON HIM BOY THAT WAS A YOU KNOW FOR A WHILE I HAD THE SERVICE BUT THEN YOU KNOW AFTER I DIDN'T HAVE IT THE WHOLE TIME BUT THE FIRST I THINK THE FIRST
YEAH BECAUSE YOU CAN AL- YOU JUST WASH THOSE YOU KNOW SO
YEAH
YOU CAN RETURN THOSE
UH-HUH
NO HUH-UH IF THEY DID THAT I WOULD TAKE THEM BACK ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I GO TO THE SAME STORE ALL THE TIME
YEAH
BUT I THINK IF THEY'D DO IT MORE WITH THE WITH THE MONEY LIKE A NICKEL OR PENNY EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE THINK IT'S NOT ENOUGH BUT IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH
UH PEOPLE DON'T UNDER- A QUARTER'S A QUARTER IT DOESN'T MATTER
YOU YOU KNOW MY SON COULD TAKE A QUARTER AND GO BUY HIM A CANDY BAR OR SOMETHING BUT I

RIGHT
CONTAMINATED IS WHAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW THEY BUT THAT YOU KNOW PLASTIC JUST DOESN'T DISINTEGRATE

FOOD STAMP
WELL WHAT KIND OF CAR UH ARE YOU THINKING OF BUYING NEXT
YOU LIKE THE CHRYSLER PRODUCTS DO YOU
DO YOU REALLY WHAT YEAR IS IT
AN- WHY DON'T YOU LIKE THE MUSTANG
I'LL BE DARNED
WELL YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYINGS ABOUT FORDS WHAT THEY STAND FOR
THERE YOU GO
WELL UH
WELL WE'VE ALWAYS UH WE'VE ALWAYS HAD OLDSMOBILES AND UH BEEN VERY UH HAPPY WITH OLDSMOBILES BUT UH
MY WIFE THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO GET A FORD MUSTANG AND THEN SHE KIND OF CHANGED HER MIND AND THINKS HER NEXT CAR OUGHT TO BE ONE OF THOSE UH MITSUBISHI ECLIPSES
SHE REAL-
SHE LIKES UH LIKES THOSE UH SHE HAS A SISTER THAT LIVES IN UH PHOENIX THAT HAS ONE AND UH REALLY UH ENJOYS IT
WELL WHAT UH WHAT THINGS DO YOU CONSIDER WHEN YOU BUY A CAR
I SEE
YEAH WELL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS AND HAVE TO MESS WITH THAT ALL THE TIME
THAT MAKES IT VERY FRUSTRATING
NOW THIS IS A LEBARON
I SURE LIKE THE UH CONVERTIBLE THOSE RAGTOP LEBARONS THEY REALLY LOOK SPORTY
WELL UH WE ALWAYS  THIS LAST OLDSMOBILE WE BOUGHT UH IT'S AN EIGHTY SEVEN BUT WE BOUGHT IT IN EIGHTY EIGHT YOU KNOW RIGHT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO GET RID OF THEM
AND UH WE FOUND THAT UH WE FOUND A REAL GOOD INTEREST RATE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF THOSE CARS AT THE END OF THE YEAR LIKE THAT THEY REALLY COME DOWN ON THEIR PRICES AND UH
UM YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AROUND AT USED CARS AND WE REALLY COULDN'T UH AFFORD THE PAYMENTS ON A USED CAR BECAUSE UH IF YOU GO TO THE BANK AND TRY TO GET A LOAN THEY WANT TO CHARGE TWELVE THIRTEEN PERCENT YOU KNOW
AND WE ENDED UP I THINK WITH LIKE A FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT INTEREST RATE ON A BRAND NEW CAR AND OUR PAYMENTS
WELL THAT'S GREAT
UH-HUH
WELL WHEN OUR KIDS WERE YOUNGER WE REALLY WANTED A TWO DOOR OUR FIRST CAR WAS AN OLDSMOBILE BACK IN SEVENTY SEVEN IT WAS A TWO DOOR CUTLASS SUPREME
AND UM IT JUST HAPPENED THAT WHEN WE LOOKED FOR OUR
OUR NEW CAR THEY HAD A THING GOING WITH OLDSMOBILE AND IF YOU'D BUY A A NEW OLDSMOBILE THEY'D GIVE YOU FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATE BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY
I BELIE- IT YEAH SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY SO IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE WE GOT OFF THE CAR ALL WE HAD TO DO IS SHOW THEM OUR
UH PAPERS ON OUR FIRST CAR AND THEY GAVE US ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OFF ON IT SO WE WE GOT A FOUR DOOR THIS TIME AND I SORT OF WENT MORE FOR THE UH
THE COMFORT FACTOR AND UH I LIKE THE SMALLER CARS BUT I'M A BIGGER PERSON AND I I REALLY LIKE COMFORT YOU KNOW DRIVING ALONG THE ROAD AND STUFF
YEP
AND IF YOU TRY TO TAKE ANYBODY UH YOU KNOW GO TO THE SHOW OR GO OUT FOR SUPPER AND YOU GO AS A FOURSOME
UH MORE THAN LIKELY IT'S GOING TO BE A CHRYSLER
UH CHRYSLER LEBARON YEAH IT IT WON'T BE A FORD I'VE GOT A FORD MUSTANG NOW AND I HATE IT
YEAH
IT'S A EIGHTY EIGHT
IT'S UM I'VE HAD ONE PROBLEM WITH IT AFTER THE OTHER THE THE THE PAI- THE PAINT'S PEELING OFF OF IT AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT YOU KNOW AND
FIX OR REPAIR DAILY OR FIND ON REA- ROAD DEAD
THAT UH I IT'S IT'S MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SHORTED OUT LIKE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND IT'S BEEN TORN UP SINCE APRIL AND I AND
LUCKILY EVERYTHING WAS UNDER WARRANTY SO IT'S ONLY COSTING LIKE A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS TO GET IT FIXED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TWO THOUSAND
THO- THOSE ARE NICE CARS
UM THE GAS MILEAGE FOR ONE THING AND I'VE UH
I'VE ALWAYS HAD LIKE STICK SHIFTS I WANT THI- NEXT CAR I WANT TO GET I WANT IT TO BE AUTOMATIC
BECAUSE I-  I'M I HATE DRIVING ANYWAY AND THEN
AND CHANGING GEARS AT STOP LIGHTS AND STUFF IS REALLY GETTING ON MY NERVES NOW
YEAH
AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WORK NINE TO FIVE OR EIGHT TO FIVE AND YOU'RE  IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC TO AND FROM WORK UNFORTUNATELY
AND I LOOK AH AND THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WITH CHRYSLER RIGHT NOW IS IS THEIR THE WARRANTIES THAT THEY HAVE AND
I'VE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S E- EVERYBODY I'VE TALKED TO THAT OWNS ONE I- I- I- IS BEEN REAL PLEASED WITH IT HM I LIKE THO- UH THO-
DRIVER'S AIR BAG I LIKE THAT
UH YEAH WELL ALL CHRYSLER PRODUCTS HAS IT IN THERE BUT I -S A CHR- LEBARON WOULD BE THE NEXT CAR I GET YEAH
YEAH YEAH I LI- I LIKE THAT TOO HUH BUT I C- I COULDN'T AFFORD THE INSURANCE ON ONE OF THOSE
YEAH
WELL TH- THAT'S WHAT I'M PAYING ON MINE NOW I- I HAD TO GET LIKE A FIRST TIME  TH- WHENEVER I GOT MY MUSTANG THIS TIME
WAS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I WAS OUT MY OWN OR WHATEVER AND UM
I HAD SAID THAT THEY THEY SAID IT HAD TO BE LIKE A FIRST TIME BUYER'S CAR OR WHATEVER AND
THEY'RE CHARGING ME UNREASONABLE ABOUT INTEREST BUT
I'VE GOT EIGHT MORE PAYMENTS AND IT'S PAID FOR
BUT I GOT IT WHEN I GOT IT WHEN THE EIGHTY EIGHTS FIRST CAME OUT
SO IT- IT'S IT'S A GOOD CAR
I MEAN I GOT IN EIGHTY SEVEN I GUESS IN LIKE NOVEMBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH-HUH
WELL THAT'S ANOTHER BIG FACTOR OF MINE NEXT NEXT CAR I GET'S GONNA BE A A FOUR DOOR TOO SOMETHING WITH SOME ROOM
BECAUSE I  MY MUSTANG'S A I- IS
TWO DOOR WITH BUCKET SEATS AND WHEN YOU BUY GROCERIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
WELL UM SINCE I'M IN COLLEGE UH I MEAN UH

RIGHT IT USED TO BE THAT WE WERE THAT THAT WE WERE TRYING TO PROTECT MORALITY NOW IT'S WE'RE PROTECTING OUR LIVES IT'S A IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT WE HAVE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST JUST HOPE FOR ABSTINENCE
YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
UH-HUH

UM ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS YOU KNOW BESIDES WHAT BESIDES WHAT THEY LEARN UH FROM
FROM OUR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IS UH THEIR EDUCATION IS JUST AMAZING KIDS ARE KIDS ARE LEARNING UH YOU KNOW THEIR MATH IS JUST EVERY YEAR UH ALGEBRA GOES DOWN A GRADE YOU KNOW AND AND UH STUDENTS LEARN IT EARLIER
NO I'M NOT THAT OLD EITHER  SO SOCIAL CHANGES AREN'T THAT MUCH FOR ME EITHER
WELL YEAH THAT
I THINK ATTITUDES ARE MORE LAX NOW THAN THEY USED TO BE
UH-HUH RELAXED
AND LAID BACK AND STUFF AND
I THINK SO I THINK SO AND A LOT I THINK PEOPLE ARE ARE USED TO NOW SAYING WHAT'S
WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS MORE UH MORE UP FRONT THAN THEY USED TO BE
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK SO I THINK WOMEN HAVE COME OUT MORE TOO ON ON LIKE CHILD ABUSE AND AND THE THE WIFE BEATINGS AND AND LIKE YOU SAID PROY-CH- P- PRO-CHOICE AND WHATNOT
I THINK THAT'S BECOME MORE OUT- OUTSTANDING THAN IT USED TO BE WHERE WOMEN I THINK USED TO BE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID OF COMING OUT AND SAYING SOMETHING
NO HUH-UH
RIGHT WELL I KNOW LIKE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND JUNIOR HIGH AND STUFF AND SITTING DOWN AND HAVING THE SEX TALK WITH MOM YOU KNOW AND ALL THAT  STUFF AND YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
WELL BASICALLY HER THING WAS JUST DON'T DO IT YOU KNOW
BUT  I'M NOT I'M NOT NAIVE TO THINK THAT MY CHILDREN ARE NOT GONNA NOT DO IT I IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT I WAS THAT YOUNG
AND I'VE GOT A TEN YEAR OLD AND YOU KNOW HE THOUGHT HE KNOWS ABOUT CONDOMS AND
AND HE KNOWS ABOUT AIDS AND  IT'S JUST D- DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT NOW THAT YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN HAVE DREAMT TO HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
UM-HUM
NO I DON'T I THINK THAT'S STUPIDITY ON PARENTS' PART I MEAN THAT'S SEX IS RAMPANT AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE AND
AND I THINK TOO  THAT THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADERS A WHICH IS WHAT MY SON IS AND STUFF THEY THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE MORE THEY'RE VERY OPEN
I MEAN THE THE BOYS ARE VERY OPEN BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S ALL I HAVE IS BOYS SO THAT'S ALL I'M AROUND BASICALLY IS BOYS
BUT THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT I MY BROTHER DIDN'T TALK ABOUT UNTIL HE WAS IN COLLEGE
YOU KNOW AND AND THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY LOOK AT YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE AND THEY EXPECT A TRUTHFUL ANSWER YOU CAN'T GET THEM GIVE THEM THE OH YOU KNOW THE CABBAGE PATCH ANSWERS AND STUFF THEY THEY THAT JUST DOES NOT
GO
AND THEY CAN TELL ME BASICALLY SOME THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW
BUT IT IT'S INTERESTING LISTENING TO THEM I THINK I I THINK THE SOCIAL CHANGES IN THEM
I THINK I SEE IT MORE WITH WITH THAT GENERATION THAN I DO WITH LIKE OUR GENERATION
YEAH I DO TOO
I KNOW UH WELL MY SON UH THE MY FOURTH GRADER HE IS IN
UM
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MAJOR SOCIAL CHANGES
WHAT AGE UH IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING

EVERYDAY
YEAH I CAN BELIEVE THAT
THAT THAT'S SOCIAL CHANGE WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE IS THE MAJOR SOCIAL CHANGE
RIGHT NOW
OKAY I THINK PROBABLY THE BIG MAJOR CHANGE IS THE ROLE OF WOMEN
I THINK ONE THE WOMEN UH IN THE WORK FORCE AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BECOMING UH MORE
UH I DON'T WANNA SAY NOT NECESSARILY POLITICALLY INCLINED BUT THEY'RE MORE APT TO BE IN POLITICAL OFFICES NOW I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN THAT RESPECT
I THINK THAT IT THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN UH I WAS NEWLY MARRIED FAMILY WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THEN I THINK WE VEERED WHERE THE FAMILY
WAS NOT AS IMPORTANT A UNIT AND I THINK NOW IT'S REVOLVING BACK FULL CIRCLE I THINK THE FAMILY UNIT IS BECOMING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WAS
THE TRU- TRUE  WELL I KNOW THAT ECONOMICALLY UH A WIFE ALMOST HAS TO WORK ANYMORE
AND YET I'M ALSO NOTICING UM
IN THE AREAS THAT I'M WORKING AND STUFF MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE WANTING NOW TO STAY HOME WITH THE CHILDREN WHERE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THEY DIDN'T I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY WANTED CHILDREN BUT THEY STILL WANTED TO BE THEIR OWN PERSON OUT IN THE WORK FORCE
BUT I SEE I AM SEEING WOMEN NOW WANTING TO STAY HOME MORE AT LEAST UNTIL THE CHILDREN ARE UP TO YOU KNOW SCHOOL AGE
AND UH I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT IT'S SORT OF REVERTING BACK
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
PROBABLY
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH IT IS IT UH
I'D I KNOW THAT I HAD TAKEN CARE OF MY GRANDCHILDREN RECENTLY WHILE MY DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN OUT OF TOWN
AND I DO NOT ENVY THESE MOTHERS OR THESE FATHERS THAT HAVE THESE THE CHILDREN THAT THEY HAVE TO RUSH HOME FROM WORK AND PICK THEM UP AT DAY CARE GET THEM THROUGH THEIR HOMEWORK GET THEM TO THEIR SOCCER PRACTICE GET THEM TO THEIR PIANO LESSONS I MEAN THAT'S TOUGH
I DON'T ENVY THESE YOUNG PARENTS
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE I DON'T KNOW
AND AND I'M FINDING YOU KNOW RUNNING INTO THESE UH WOMEN THAT ARE WANTING TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF
THIRTY NINE FORTY I'M THINKING AT THE AGE OF FIFTY TWO YOU'RE CRAZY
I JUST KNOW IT IT ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTS ME MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S MY GRANDCHILDREN AND IT'S NOT MY CHILDREN MAYBE TH-
WELL
WELL I'M I'M UH THIRTY ONE
YEAH RIGHT  WELL I YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE SEEN A A SOCIAL CHANGE YES
IT'S DEFINITELY FOR SURE AND IT'S UH UH AND BESIDES THAT I CAME FROM CALIFORNIA WHERE SOCIAL CHANGE IS LIKE YOU KNOW
YEAH I MEAN EVERY SECOND
YOU KNOW SOCIAL CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA MEANS IT TAKES ANOTHER TWO OR THREE MINUTES LONGER TO GET TO WORK
AND UH WHEN I STARTED WORK THERE IN UH STARTED YOU KNOW ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK IN EIGHTY TWO I GUESS THAT'S WHEN IT WAS BETWEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EIGHTY FIVE
UH IT STARTED OUT TAKING ME AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET TO WORK AND THEN IT BECAME YOU KNOW AN HOUR AND A HALF TO YOU KNOW SOME DAYS TWO HOURS TO GET TO WORK
THAT'S SOCIAL CHANGE
OOH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A TRICKY ONE I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH I THINK IT'S THAT'S PROBABLY FOR TWO REASONS UM
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE IS IS WOMEN WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND THE SECOND REASON WAS IS EVERYTHING COSTS SO MUCH MORE THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE
YOU KNOW EQUAL RIGHTS SO THAT YOUR WIFE GETS EQUAL PAY YOU CAN'T MAKE TWICE AS MUCH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH I I'VE I'VE I'VE FOUND THAT TOO YOU KNOW WHERE THE WIFE IS MARRIED AND
AND I MEAN NOT NOT MARRIED SORRY WRONG WORD WHERE THE WIFE HAS GONE TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW AND GOTTEN A DEGREE SPENT FIVE YEARS OUT IN THE WORK FORCE FOUND YOU KNOW THE THE
THEIR HUSBAND EITHER AT COLLEGE OR WHATEVER BUT STILL YOU KNOW AFTER FIVE YEARS IT'S LIKE FIRST KID AND THEN THEY'RE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS
BUT I THINK MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT  I THINK THAT GENERATION THEY'RE ALL AT HOME RIGHT NOW AND AND WE WON'T SEE THEM BACK FOR ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS
UH I'M VERY RARELY DO I MEET ANYBODY WHOSE CHILDREN ARE ARE YOU KNOW PAST THAT AGE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A FEW YEARS
BUT UH IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM  OH YEAH W-
I'M AN ASSISTANT SCOUT MASTER AND THAT'S THAT'S  IT'S LIKE UH YEAH WELL PARENTS UH EVEN RARELY SEE THEIR KIDS FOR WEEKENDS WHICH IS YOU KNOW KIND OF ROUGH TOO
ESPECIALLY NOW YEAH
UH-HUH
WELL I I- I KNOW TWO WOMEN THAT THAT UH LET'S SEE ONE OF THEM'S FORTY NINE AND THE OTHER ONE WE- THE OTHER ONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER AGE IS BUT I KNOW SHE'S SHE'S
SOMEWHERE IN THAT HAIRY AGE OF OF HALF A CENTURY UP THERE
AND UH BOY I'LL TELL YOU THESE ARE THE THE GO-GETTINGEST HAPPIEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET YOU KNOW
I'M THIRTY I'M GETTING GRAY HAIRS ALREADY
UM
FOR NIST THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY
I SUPPOSE SO LET ME PUSH THE BUTTON
OKAY
UM I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ALL FOR SWITCHING TO THE METRIC SYSTEM
BUT UH I SENSE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON
UM-HUM
YOU'RE NOW IN WHAT
ACOUSTICS AH
WELL I GUESS THAT IS THE POLICY BUT IT'S BEEN THE POLICY FOR A LONG TIME AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS UH
I SUPPOSE THINGS SOME THINGS WELL HAPPEN SLOWLY SIMPLY BY HAVING IT TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS MORE TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S HAPPENING
HAVING A NEW GENERATION COME UP THAT'S MORE USED TO IT
THEY HAVE TO FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE
BUT I G- GUESS IT'S IT'S EASIER TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH THAN IT USED TO BE
UH BE- BE- BECAUSE OF OF UH OF COMPUTERS COMING INTO EVERYTHING
EVERYONE WANTS A WANTS A CONVERSION OF THAT BEFORE PUT A RECOGNIZING IT AS A AS AS AS AS A CONCEPT TO HOLD IN MIND
UM
I- I- I DON'T SEE THAT IT IT IT CAN CHANGE IT VERY QUICKLY I MEAN WE'RE NOT THE KIND OF SOCIETY THAT  THAT UH
THAT SOMETHING CAN BE POSED UPON UH BY GOVERNMENT WILL
UH THE THE THE THE PUBLIC IS JUST VERY CONSERVATIVE THAT WAY IN IN REFUSING TO CHANGE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS UH MONEY DOLLAR COINS ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AND AND IT AND IT IT OBVIOUSLY MAKES NO SENSE THAT WE'RE PRACTICALLY
ALONE IN THE WORLD IN
IN USING THE OLD SYSTEM
WELL I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY I THINK
PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE RELATIVELY R- RARE WHO ARE COMING UP AGAINST THIS PROBLEM EVERYDAY
UH I MEAN THERE THERE ARE THINGS YOU COULD DO UH WE HAVE SIGNS UP ON THE NIST CAMPUS HERE SPEED LIMIT TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR FORTY KILOMETERS PER HOUR
UH BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN ADOPTED VERY WIDELY
BUT UH I MEAN AND NO ONE WILL WILL GO A STEP FURTHER TO REMOVE THE ENGLISH SIGNS
UH YOU KNOW OR I MEAN YOU HAVE HIGHWAY SIGNS SAYING SPEED LIMIT UM
EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE WHATEVER WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER
HUNDRED CAR IS GOING SIXTY TWO YEAH SO IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE UH LIKE NINETY I GUESS CAR IS GOING FIFTY FIVE UH YOU SUDDENLY HAVE A  HAVE A EVEN WORSE PROBLEM WITH SPEEDING THAN WE DO NOW
DO  DO DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE DO THE SCHOOLS
EMPHASIZE THE METRIC SYSTEM
NO I- I- I MEANT I MEANT DOWN LIKE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
I MEAN I THINK
YEAH I MEAN I THINK MY CHILDREN LEARNED THE METRIC SYSTEM BUT IT DOESN'T GET GET EMPHASIZED OVER THE OTHER
OH OKAY SO IT'S RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY THEN
ALL RIGHT
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA HAPPEN EITHER BUT I WISH IT WERE
BECAUSE I'M A I GOT MY BACHELOR'S IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING I'M AT GRAD SCHOOL NOW IN ACOUSTICS AND ALL WE DO IS METRIC STUFF
ACOUSTICS
YEAH SO EVERYTHING'S METRIC AND THEN YOU GO TO READ SOME OLD BOOK OR SOMETHING AND IT'S ALL CONFUSING SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND AS MUCH
SO I THINK WE SHOULD GET ONE ADOPTED PERMANENTLY
YEAH A LOT OF INDUSTRY OUT THERE IS DOING METRIC STUFF JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH I DON'T THINK SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH IS THAT BIG A DEAL I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE LIKE WHAT A METER IS INSTEAD OF HOW MANY FEET IN A METER OR SOMETHING
JUST GET USED TO USING ALL THE TERMS
BECAUSE SOMEONE SAYS A KILOGRAM NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT IS
YEAH
YEAH NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ADOPTING IT
THE METRIC SYSTEM NO ONE'S VERY UH NO ONE WANTS IT AT ALL SEEMS LIKE
YEAH
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IT'S PRETTY TOUGH WHEN YOU GET EVERYTHING CONFUSED THOUGH I THINK TWO SYSTEMS IS WORSE THAN ONE THOUGH
BECAUSE I KNOW WE DO A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND THINGS AND THEY'RE HALF ENGLISH AND HALF METRIC AND
YOU YOU MAKE MORE MISTAKES DOING ALL THE CONVERSIONS THAN YOU WOULD DOING THE PROBLEMS
I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST GET ONE EVEN IF IT'S I PREFER METRIC BUT EVEN IF IT'S JUST ENGLISH THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE ONE
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
BECAUSE YOUR YOUR AVERAGE GUY DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY  WANTS TO KNOW HOW MANY MILES IT IS TO HIS DESTINATION
YEAH
YEAH THEY HAVE SOME OF THOSE IN OHIO THERE'S THIS ONE SIGN'S KIND OF FUNNY IT SAYS UH METRIC SIGNS NEXT HUNDRED MILES
YEAH THAT'D FORCE EVERYBODY TO USE IT OR TO QUIT SELLING TAPE MEASURES IN INCHES
YEAH I GUESS A HUNDRED'S SIXTY TWO
YEAH YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TRYING TO DO NINETY
YEAH IN THE ENGINEERING THEY ALL DO PRETTY MUCH
OH IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS I DON'T KNOW I WOULDN'T THINK SO
I REMEMBER A WAYS BACK WE DID LIKE CONVERSIONS BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND MEASURED ANYTHING OR DID ANYTHING ON ONE SYSTEM
YEAH THEY LEARN HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN AN INCH AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
WELL UH CITY SLICKERS AND
STAR TREK FIVE
YEAH UH
YEAH I THOUGHT I'D BETTER SEE THAT ONE BEFORE I GO AND SEE SIX
NO I FOUND THAT OUT
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF
HOW IS IT
OH I CAN'T WAIT
NOW DOES THE OLD STAR TREK GUYS MEET THE NEW GUYS
NO IT'S JUST THE OLD GUYS STILL
YOU KNOW THAT I READ IN PEOPLE OR SOMEWHERE NO IT WAS USA TODAY
THAT THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T GONNA DO ANYMORE THAT WAS IT
BUT
HUH I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IN LIGHT YEARS BETWEEN THE NEW GENERATION AND THE THE OLD GUYS WAS
HUH
OH THAT'S RIGHT
IS THAT RIGHT HE WAS A DOCTOR STILL
WELL YEAH HE DIDN'T LOOK TOO BAD DID HE
YES YEAH THAT'S AMAZING
UH DID THEY HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS
YEAH FIVE WAS THE SCRIPT WAS BAD BAD BAD  NO I DON'T WHY
OH IS THAT RIGHT
UH
L- LEONARD IT ITS NIMOY HE DOES A LOT BETTER
IN SEARCH OF SPOCK OR NO JOURNEY HOME I THINK THAT
ARE YOU'RE A REAL LIFE TREKKIE
I REALLY LIKE THEM I- I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR AS BEING A TREKKIE BUT
UH-HUH
OH REALLY
HUH DID YOU GET TO TALK TO HIM
IT WAS CROWDED NO
YEAH WOW
HUH THEY HAVE SOME GOOD MANAGEMENT PRINCIPALS IN THIS NEW GENERATION
OH
RIGHT AND HE KIND OF WAS A COWBOY TYPE TOO
HE MADE ALL THE DECISIONS BUT UH JEAN LUKE DOES MORE OF A A COMMITTEE TYPE OF MANAGEMENT
WHAT OTHER MOVIES HAVE YOU SEEN
OH HOW WAS THAT
LOTS OF LITTLE FUNNY SPOTS HUH
DID THEY HAVE THING AND
REALLY
HOW DID I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW HE GETS AROUND
BUT HE'S IN A BOX RIGHT
DIDN'T HE USED TO
OH
WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN LATELY
FIVE
YEAH YOU ONLY ONLY FIVE
I JUST SAW THE LATEST ONE
IT WAS FANTASTIC
YEAH IT'S THE THE LINES IN THERE WERE JUST PERFECT I MEAN IT WAS CLASSIC TREK
NO HUH-UH
YEAH IT WAS JUST A RUMOR THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN THIS TIME
HOWEVER THE RUMOR IS IS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN NE- HAPPEN NEXT TIME SO
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH UH
EXCEPT THAT THE RUMOR IS IS THAT THEY STILL MIGHT BUT IT MAY NOT INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CREW AND IT WILL BE A NEXT GENERATION MEETS THIS GENERATION
SO
I THINK IT'S A HUNDRED YEARS
SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE
CONSIDERING THAT SPOCK WAS ON AN UH YOU KNOW COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND AND THAT THE THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF NEXT GENERATION THEY HAD MCCOY
AND UM-HUM YEAH WELL YOU KNOW HE IT WAS LIKE A REAR ADMIRAL WHATEVER YOU KNOW AND HE JUST KIND OF HOBBLED DOWN THE HALLS REAL SLOW VULCANS AGE A LOT BETTER
HUH NO HUH-UH
MATTER OF FACT HE LOOKS JUST AS ABOUT AS OLD AND THE UH NEXT GENERATION AS HE DOES IN THE LATEST STAR TREK
OH EXCELLENT EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECTS
BUT I THINK THE SCRIPT WAS YOU KNOW JUST INCREDIBLE COMPARED TO THE LAST ONE
WELL YOU KNOW WHY
UH WILLIAM SHATNER WROTE IT
AND EVEN WORSE HE DIRECTED IT
OH YEAH HE IN FACT UH HE DIDN'T DIRECT THIS ONE HE PRODUCED THIS ONE
BUT HE DIRECTED THE ONE BEFORE UH I THINK STAR TREK FOUR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH UM-HUM
W- I THINK SO
UM-HUM
WELL I'VE GONE TO YOU KNOW ONE FOR REAL LIVE TREK CONVENTION BUT
YEAH I SAW JAMES DOOHAN YOU KNOW THE GUY THAT PLAYS UH SCOTTY
NO  IT WAS A PRETTY CROWDED PLACE
OH YEAH YEAH I IT'S IT'S KIND OF FUNNY I UH WAS READING IN UH A BOOK
UH TRYING TO THINK I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE BOOK BUT IT WAS IT WAS SAYING DON'T DO STAR TREK MANAGEMENT STYLE
AND THEY WERE REFERRING TO YOU KNOW CAPTAIN KIRK EVERY TIME HE LEFT THE ENTERPRISE EVERYTHING WENT TO HELL
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH UM
IT'S DEFINITELY A LOT BETTER  A LOT MORE REALISTIC REALLY
UH SAW THE ADDAMS FAMILY LAST WEEK
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD UH THERE WERE A FEW THINGS DIFFERENT THAN THE OLD SERIES BUT ON THE ON THE WHOLE IT WAS PRETTY SIMILAR
AND  A LOT OF FUN
OH YEAH YEAH
OH YES IN FACT THING HAS A BIG MUCH BIGGER ROLE THAN HE DOES IN THE SERIES
I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE IS LOTS OF AREAS WHERE THING SAVES THE DAY
AND HE RUNS AROUND A LOT
UH YOU KNOW JUST FINGER HOPPING
NO NO NO IN FACT IT'S FUNNY HE NEVER DID DOES COME IN OUT OF A BOX I DON'T THINK AND HE'S JUST KIND OF WALKING AROUND
NOT REALLY HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE BOX BEFORE
ALL RIGHT THIS IS MY OPINION I I'M STILL A STUDENT RIGHT NOW AND I'M ACTUALLY STUDYING IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION I THINK THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS TODAY
UM MORE THAN ANYTHING I JUST BELIEVE THAT AS STUDENTS WE'RE TAUGHT TO LEARN WHAT THE TEACHER WANTS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY UM GAINING A FURTHER VANTAGE POINT
AND SO IT'S BASICALLY WE'RE TAUGHT TO BE MEDIOCRE IN WHAT WE LEARN
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
HUM-UM
UM-HUM
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT'S REALLY A A A REALLY NEAT FIELD I UH WORK RIGHT NOW IN A SPECIAL CENTER FOR ABUSED CHILDREN AND FOR SOME OF THE LEARNING DISABLED
AND IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW TH- THEY CAN LEARN QUICKLY IF YOU JUST FIND WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM
AND I THINK LIKE YOU SAID AT LEAST IN MY OPINION I THINK THEY PUT A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON TEACHERS OF HOW THEY CAN TEACH THEM YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
I- I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TOO I THINK ALONG WITH THE SPECIAL CHILDREN I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS GIFTED AND IN SCHOOL HE DID TERRIBLE H- ALL HIS YEARS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE WHO EVER CHALLENGED OR WHOEVER FOUND WHAT EXACTLY WAS WHAT HE NEEDED IN TERMS OF LEARNING
AND I THINK AGAIN IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE SAME THING OF YOU KNOW BEING MEDIOCRE IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO
UM-HUM
RIGHT
WELL I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
YOU KNOW I THINK PERSONALLY LIKE YOU SAID IT IT HAS  MORE TO DO WITH THE TEACHERS COMING OUT OF THEIR SHELL AND NOT BEING AFRAID TO MAKE MISTAKES AND SAYING YOU KNOW HEY I'M I'M GONNA TRY THIS IF IT WORKS GREAT IF IT DOESN'T I APOLOGIZE
AND I I FOUND  IN MY OWN SCHOOLING THAT WHEN THE TEACHERS MADE THAT SPECIAL EFFORT TO TO MAKE THE CLASS EXCITING TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT TO TO CHALLENGE MY INTELLECT OR TO TO BRING ABOUT A DIFFERENT METHOD OF TEACHING I WAS A LOT MORE INTERESTED IN LEARNING
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE GRADING SYSTEMS AND AND HOW THOSE WORK
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
DO YOU THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH FOCUS ON GRADES GRADES INSTEAD OF LEARNING
UM-HUM
RIGHT
HUH-UH
UM-HUM
HM
RIGHT
YEAH AND I THINK AT LEAST AS ME AS A COLLEGE STUDENT I HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY
WHEN YOU GO OUT FOR A JOB OR WHATEVER THEY'RE GONNA FOCUS ON YOUR GRADES AND I THINK AGAIN THAT A LOT OF THE SCHOOL PROBLEMS ARE MORE SOCIETY PROBLEMS WHERE THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUALS AS M- MUCH AS THEY ARE JUST THE WHOLE OVERALL PICTURE
AND YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID I I LIKE THE POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT THAT YOU SAID REALLY I- IT NEEDS TO BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND I THINK AS THAT HAPPENS MORE THAT THE SCHOOLING WILL BECOME BETTER
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
YEAH  I'M STILL IN SCHOOL AND UH BUT I WANNA GO INTO TEACHING SPECIAL ED
AND UM I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THAT AREA A I THINK THERE IS PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WHETHER IT BE
UM ELEMENTARY YOU KNOW OR EVEN COLLEGES YOU KNOW HAVE THEIR FLAWS BUT  ESPECIALLY IN THE LEARNING DISABILITIES BECAUSE UM
A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW TEACHERS THINK OH THIS KID'S DUMB AND YOU KNOW THEY JUST NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE KNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW ABOUT  THIS AREA
OF UH
TYPE OF KIDS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO BECOME NEW AND AND THEY'RE STARTING TO FIND OUT MORE RESEARCH ABOUT UM THIS TYPE OF LEARNING
AND SO
UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT IT THEY'RE THEY HIRE TEACHERS WHO AREN'T EVEN QUALIFIED TO TEACH THOSE KIND OF KIDS AND THEY BURN OUT SO FAST THEY DON'T WANNA TEACH THEM
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TEACHERS WHO WANT TO DO THAT  MAY HAVE A LEARNING DISABILITY THEY TEST THEM AND FIND OUT THAT THEY DO AND THEN IT'S JUST A GROWING FIELD BECAUSE MORE AND MORE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED INTO THAT
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT YEAH LIKE  EVERYBODY NOT JUST PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS UM LEARN DIFFERENTLY I MEAN
YOU KNOW ONE TEACHER CAN GO OUT AND LEARN HOW TO TEACH BUT
PROBLEMS YOU KNOW LEARNING THAT AND COMPREHENDING WELL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I THINK IT'S I THINK MORE TEACHERS SHOULD UM
FIND DIFFERENT WAYS AND BE CREATIVE ON THEIR TEACHING
SO
RIGHT UM-HUM
YEAH EXACTLY
THE GRADING S- GRADING SYSTEM UM
WELL
I THINK UM WELL IN A SENSE IT'S PROBABLY TOO EASY BUT IF IT WASN'T
UM THESE KIDS YOU KNOW I MEAN NOWADAYS A LOT OF KIDS THEY JUST YOU KNOW DON'T TRY THEY DON'T GET THE GRADES THAT THEY COULD
AND UM
I DON'T
I DON'T
YEAH I THINK
WELL THE FIELD I WANNA GO INTO GRADES TO ME DOESN'T MEAN MUCH IT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW INTELLIGENT YOU ARE HOW BRIGHT YOU ARE YOU KNOW UM
BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY BRIGHT AND VERY INTELLIGENT BUT JUST DOESN'T GET THE GRADES AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LEARNING DISABILITY UM SO YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT THERE WHERE THEY DON'T FOCUS ENOUGH ON THEM
HOW THEY LEARN AND WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING YOU KNOW NOT ON THE GRADE
RIGHT
UM-HUM YEAH
WELL I GOT A COUPLE OF THEM I AT THE MOMENT USE AN AST 286 AND I GOT A LEADING EDGE AND I GOT A AMERICAN ONE AND HAD A IBM ONE BUT
OH YEAH
WHAT DID YOU DO PUT IT TOGETHER
WELL THAT'S

OH IS IT REAL EXPENSIVE
OH OKAY
OH MY GOODNESS
YEAH WELL DO DO THEY DO OTHER THINGS FOR Y'ALL
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
HM BUT YOU KNEW WHEN YOU MOVED IN YOU'D HAVE TO PAY THAT DIDN'T YOU
OH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW EITHER THAT'S INTERESTING
UM-HUM
NOW DO THEY DO THINGS LIKE PLANT BUSHES AND TREES
OH OKAY SO THERE'S LIKE NO RESTRICTION ON WHAT TYPES OF BUSHES YOU CAN HAVE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
UM-HUM YEAH WHEN WE MOVED INTO OUR HOUSE I JUST HATED THE BUSHES THEY HAD AND I- I RIPPED MOST OF THEM OUT AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK AND PUT NEW ONES OUT FRONT BUT THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK TOOK ME A LONG TIME
UM-HUM
YEAH AND THEN THEN WE PUT IN A SPRINKLER SYSTEM AND WE WON'T GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN I WILL PAY SOMEONE TO DO IT OH IT TOOK SO LONG
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS YOU KNOW DIGGING THE TRENCHES BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET A TRENCHER YOU KNOW THERE THE MACHINE THAT'LL DO IT BECAUSE HE KNEW SO MANY PEOPLE THAT BROKE IT THROUGH THEIR WATER MAIN OR THEIR GAS MAIN DOING IT
AND I GUESS THAT COSTS YOU AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE
BY HAND YEAH YEAH
BUT IT WORKS GREAT NOW THAT WE'VE GOT IT YEAH IT'S NICE
YEAH WELL WE NEEDED TO BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING SOME FOUNDATION TROUBLE AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE THE AREA MOIST AROUND THE HOUSE OR IT MAKES IT WORSE SO WE HAD AN INCENTIVE THERE
UH-HUH I HAVE A HOME
NOT REALLY WE HAVE A A SMALL BACK YARD AND SMALL FRONT YARD BUT UM
UM I DO BASICALLY LIKE THE SHRUBBERY AND THE PLANTING AND THE WEEDING AND HE MOWS THE LAWN BECAUSE THE LAWN MOWER'S TOO HEAVY
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY  AND UM
AND UH I DO THE EDGING AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT UM IT DOESN'T TAKE US THAT LONG BECAUSE OUR OUR YARD'S SO SMALL BUT UM I TRY AND DO AS MUCH YOU KNOW FLOWERING AS I CAN AND
THAT KIND OF STUFF THE SEASONAL THINGS
BUT UM
AND WELL I THINK WE HAVE ONE OF THE NICEST YARDS IN THE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
UH-HUH
YES
OH
OH GO-
YEAH I DON'T BLAME
YEAH HUH
OKAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY BUSHES TO PUT THEM ON UM OUR OUR YARDS ARE VERY UH NARROW AND SO WE HAVE SOME BUSHES BUT WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY BUT WE HAVE A NICE TREE IN THE FRONT AND
UH WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT AN ASSOCIATION THAT COMES AND MOWS EVERYBODY'S FRONT YARD AND UM THEY KEEP HI- HITTING IT THE TREE WITH THE LAWN MOWER YOU KNOW EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT YOU
IT IT UM KIND OF
KILLS THE TREE FOR A WHILE AND SO THAT'S KIND OF STUNT ITS GROWTH FOR JUST A WHILE UNTIL WE GET IT BACK GOING AGAIN
AND WE STARTED MOWING OUR OWN LAWN BECAUSE THEY WERE DOING THAT AND SO ANYWAYS WE HAVE A NICE FULL TREE NOW AND AND WE PUT OUR WE USUALLY FILL IT WITH LIGHTS AND THAT KIND OF THING
SO
AND THEY WOULD UM THEY ALSO EDGED AND THEY WOULD EDGE IN- INTO THE SHRUBBERY AND OH GOSH IT WAS GETTING REALLY BAD SO WE
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S AN ASSOCIATION FEE
YES IT'S LIKE SEVENTY A MONTH
YEAH AND IT I DON'T LIKE I- I JUST GET REALLY UPSET EVERY TIME I MAKE THAT CHECK OUT BUT UM
THEY TAKE CARE OF THE UM LANDSCAPE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A CUL-DE-SAC AND THERE'S A ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE AND SO THEY CARE OF THAT AND THERE'S A POOL AND THEY TAKE CARE OF THE POOL AND AND THERE'S A POND THEY TAKE CARE OF THE POND AND THE PARK AREA AND THAT KIND OF THING AND SO YOU'RE
BASICALLY PAYING OH AND THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM THAT THAT OUR YARD DOESN'T HAVE A SPRINKLER SYSTEM BUT THE ISLAND DOES AND UM CERTAIN SHARING AREAS HAVE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS AND
AND SO THAT WAY IF SOMEONE MOVES OUT THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD IS MOWED AND WATERED AND THAT KIND OF THING YOU KNOW SO
WELL IT IT IT WENT UP SINCE WE PAY AND THAT'S THE BAD THING I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T GO UP ANY MORE BECAUSE WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYMORE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT
SO UM BUT THEY'RE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THEY TAKE CARE OF BASICALLY THE FRONT YARDS AND UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO DO IT AND
THEY O- ONLY IN LIKE IN THE COMMON AREAS AND THEN THE ISLAND BUT THEY DON'T DO IT IN YOUR YARD
RIGHT UH-HUH YEAH SO WE'VE ADDED BUSHES AND AND SHRUBBERY TOO

I- IN FACT THIS MORNING I WAS ALMOST LATE FOR WORK BECAUSE I'M ALMOST AT THE END OF THIS BOOK AND I DIDN'T WANNA PUT IT DOWN
BUT I LIKE I LIKE MYSTERIES
UH YES I LIKE UH
UM
OH I'M DRAWING A BLANK
UH
HE WROTE THE UH BOURNE ULTIMATUM
LUDWIG YES
AND UH
I LIKE JEFFREY ARCHER
HE IS AN ENGLISH AUTHOR WHO WRITES SOME MYSTERY UM
WELL I GUESS THEY'RE THEY'RE A TYPE OF MYSTERY THEY'RE USUALLY SOME P- HE'S A EX-LAWYER
SO OR HE HE'S A LAWYER WHO NO LONGER PRACTICES BUT HIS ARE ALL HAVE SOME PART OF THE LAW UH ENVELOPED IN THEM
RIGHT AND THEN UH THE NEW AUTHOR THAT CAME OUT WITH UH
OH THE ONE THAT UH HARRISON FORD
STARRED IN
NO NO IT WAS THE UH
IT'S LATE I'M TIRED SO I'M NOT THINKING TOO WELL
UH-HUH
OH IT'S  UH IT WAS HIS FIRST BOOK IT CAME IT WAS ON THE TOP OF THE LIST UM
HE WAS A DA
YES
OKAY AND THEN HIS HE CAME OUT WITH THE SECOND ONE
UH
A SEQUEL TO IT
AND BOTH OF THOSE I'VE ENJOYED REAL WELL
BUT I I LIKE THAT I LOVE DANIELLE STEELE AND AND  YOU KNOW IF I WANNA GET A FANTASY AND
GET AWAY FROM IT ALL
NO NO SHE ISN'T AT ALL HER BOOKS UH
YOU ALWAYS CRY
I MEAN IT'S  IT'S ALWAYS GOOD FOR GOOD TEARS
UH ONE BOOK THAT SHE WROTE THAT'S GOOD FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IS FINE THINGS
F I N E THINGS
WELL IT'S IT'S ONE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ALWAYS GONNA MAKE YOU HAVE A GOOD CRY AND YOU DOW IT'S GONNA TURN OUT GOOD AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HAPPY IN THE END
AND I SAID YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TOO REAL ANYMORE I HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT IN MY OWN LIFE I WANT I WANT HAPPY FANTASY LIKE
UH-HUH
UH
I I DO MY SHARE OF IT I I CERTAINLY CAN'T SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF IT
NO MAYBE NOT HOW BIG IS PROVO THAT
THAT A LITTLE TOWN OR I- ONE OF THE BIGGER CITIES
OH I- I TALKED TO SOMEONE THAT WAS O- ONLY A COUPLE OF THOUSAND IN HER TOWN I THINK
YEAH I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE TOWN I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS YOU
OH WELL ANYWAY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION I CERTAINLY HAD SOME IDEAS SINCE I'M STUDYING IT NOW IN COLLEGE
I'D SAY FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO SPENDING MORE TIME ON THE BASIC READING WRITING ARITHMETIC
AND GRADE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY REALLY TEACH ABOUT FORTY PERCENT LESS THAN THEY USED TO AND IT SHOWS UP
THAT'S ONE IDEA YOU HAVE ANY HM
UM-HUM
YEAH IT PLANO'S UH IMPROVED GREATLY IN THE LAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT'S FOR SURE IT USED TO BE THE PITS
AND UH ARLINGTON IS EXCELLENT NOW BUT I'M JUST SPEAKING OVERALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG
AND UH ONE THING THEY DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME
JUST TEACHING READING AND WRITING SO A LOT OF KIDS ARE JUST BEING PROMOTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THEY TRULY CAN'T READ
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY EXPECT THEM TO UH PASS
HISTORY WHEN THEY CAN'T READ ANYTHING YOU KNOW OR EVEN READ A WORD PROBLEM IN MATH
SO UM THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM ANOTHER PROBLEM IS YOU'RE NOT GONNA KEEP THE SMARTER PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM TOO LONG PAYING THE WAGES THEY DO
BUT UM
WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE THEY'RE ALL SO DIFFERENT THAT'S ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES THERE'S NO NATIONAL CURRICULUM YOU KNOW
I MEAN WHAT THEY'D BE TEACHING IN AN ARLINGTON SCHOOL THEY MIGHT NOT BE TEACHING IN A PLANO SCHOOL AND AND THE VERY SAME
SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU MAY EVEN IN AN ARLINGTON SEVENTH GRADE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE
AN ENGLISH CLASS YOU MAY HAVE HALF LITERATURE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR WHEREAS IN ANOTHER ONE THEY'RE GONNA CONCENTRATE ON GRAMMAR AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE LITERATURE IT'S UP TO THE TEACHER IN OTHER WORDS
SO THAT'S KIND OF O- YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ODD TO ME
IT DEPENDS ON UM
WHAT SCHOOL YOU'RE IN AND WHO YOUR TEACHER IS ACTUALLY
UH OR IS IT HOW YOU END UP OVERALL ARLINGTON IS GOOD ONE OF THE BETTER ONES IN THE STATE SO I GUESS WE LUCKED OUT WHEN WE MOVED HERE
UM-HUM  OF COURSE WE HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM IN THAT UH THE NUMBER OF THE ILLITERATE IN AMERICA IS MUSHROOMING
AT THIS POINT AND UH YOU KNOW WHERE OUR KIDS MIGHT BE IN A GREAT SCHOOL WE'RE STILL PAYING AN AWFUL LOT OF TAXES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON WELFARE AND UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T READ YOU KNOW
SO IF Y-
I DON'T KNOW I JUST READ ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY AND I HAD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF IT ACTUALLY IT MAKES SENSE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE SOMETIMES
UH LIKE A THIRD GRADE TEACHER WILL GET KIDS FROM SECOND GRADE THAT DIDN'T EVEN LEARN WHAT UH THEY SHOULD TO DO THE WORK THAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO TEACH YOU KNOW
OH THE AND UH ACCORDING TO HER PLAN SO I GUESS IF THERE WAS A NATIONAL CURRICULUM WE'D AT LEAST  HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT ALL KIDS WOULD LEARN
BUT UH WE ACTUALLY RANK FORTY NINTH IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS JUST PLAIN LITERACY GOES YOU KNOW
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY LOW THAT THERE'S FORTY EIGHT COUNTRIES AHEAD OF US THAT HAVE MORE PEO- MORE CITIZENS PERCENTAGEWISE THAT CAN READ AND WRITE
SO UM
UNLESS WE WANNA KEEP PAYING
PAYING FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T MAKE IT IN SOCIETY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW OBVIOUSLY NOBODY'S SMART ENOUGH TO SAY I'VE FIGURED IT OUT YET SO I PROBABLY CAN'T
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO CUT OUT SOME OF THIS FOLDEROL STUFF AND GO BACK IN THE FIRST FIVE SIX GRADES AND JUST KEEP G- GOING OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL MOST OF THOSE TH- ARE CAPABLE CAN AT LEAST LEARN TO READ AND WRITE
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THE MEANIALEST
JOB WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO READ SOMETHING NOWADAYS
YOU KNOW
UH
YOU CAN B- YOU CAN'T EVEN WORK AN ANSWERING MACHINE I- IF YOU WERE AT WORK AND HAD TO GET A MESSAGE OR SOME- YOU KNOW OR FILL OUT AN APPLICATION TO WORK AT MCDONALD'S IF YOU CAN'T READ
SO UH I THINK THAT THAT'S A START AT LEAST GOING BACK TO THE BASICS IN THE EARLY GRADES
HM
AND UM
THEY SAY THAT THE AVERAGE ENGLISH STUDENT NOWADAYS DOES AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT LESS READING AND WRITING THAN THEY DID TWENTY YEARS AGO
AND THAT'S A BIG JUMP
YEAH DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN PLANO
THROUGH THE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL
UM IT
UM IT'S NOT ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES IT'S PROBABLY HM
I COMPARE IT TO THE SIZE OF PLANO MAYBE A LITTLE SMALLER
PLANO TEXAS
OH REALLY
NO
UH-HUH
UM
I DON'T KNOW I'M PRETTY I THINK I'M PRETTY SATISFIED WITH
UM I GR- I GREW UP IN PLANO
AND AND MY DAD IS ACTUALLY ON THE SCHOOL BOARD THERE SO
I KIND OF KEPT UP WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT WENT ON
YEAH
OH
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM
RIGHT
SO DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOOD ABOUT
THE SCHOOLS
YEAH
UM-HUM
GRAMMAR
YEAH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM SO YEAH THAT'S THE THING IS JUST TO LOOK AT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE AREA THAT YOU MOVE INTO BEFORE YOU
I GUE-
UM-HUM
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE UM NATIONWIDE UM CURRICULUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM
YEAH
WHO DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH I BELIEVE THAT
I DID YEAH
UH-HUH UH KINDER-
YOU'VE DONE
AND HOW DID IT GO
JEEZ IT'S LIKE STARTING OVER I GUESS
OH
UH-HUH  AND IT
BOY THAT SOUNDS LIKE UH COURSE UH I DON'T KNOW ONCE YOU GET IT DONE THEN YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM AGAIN
UM I- YOU'VE GOT AN OLDER HOUSE
THEY UH BUILT A LITTLE BIT MORE STURDY THAN
RIGHT
OH IS THAT RIGHT
YES
AND IT'S ALL BEEN SO
AND JUST START AT SQUARE ONE
HUH
WELL AND THEN IF YOU DO IT WRONG
EVERYTHING WENT ALL RIGHT
THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING YOU CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND ARE GLAD WHEN THAT HAPPEN
RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
ALL WORKED OUT ALL RIGHT HUH
WELL UM AH PROBABLY THE LAST THING I DID WAS UH PAINT AND WALLPAPER KIDS ROOM
AND UH I LEARNED UH I USED THE WRONG KIND OF PAINT THIS WASN'T MUST HAVE NOT BEEN A VERY GOOD QUALITY BECAUSE IT JUST HASN'T
STOOD UP VERY WELL
IT WAS A LATEX PLAINT PAINT IT WAS FLAT AND I WONDER IF MAYBE I SHOULD'VE USED THE GLOSS
UH BUT THEY SAY YOU UH USE YOUR GLOSS MAINLY IN YOUR
KITCHENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH BUT I THINK MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS JUST THE
WELL IT IT IS A LATEX PAINT BUT IT JUST KIND OF IS SO YOU KNOW SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO WASH YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO WASH IT
BUT IT UM JUST LOOKS DINGY I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN IT JUST IT'S PINK
IT'S KIND OF GOT UH
OH JUST KIND OF A WORN LOOK TO IT I DON'T EVE- EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY  JUST DIDN'T TURN OUT QUITE AS NICE AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT
WE PUT TWO COATS ON IT AND IT'S A SMALL ROOM BUT I THINK IT ONLY TOOK ONE UH CAN
NO
WE DID UH
OH YOU DO MIX THE COLOR AS FAR AS
YOU START WITH UH WHITE AND THEN THEY ADD THE COLOR YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING BUT
YES RIGHT AND THEN I WALLPAPERED A COUPLE OF WALLS AND UH
WELL THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER WALLPAPERED AND UH  THAT'S A AN EDUCATION IN ITSELF
BUT UH THE DYE LOTS UH MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM FIRST OF ALL IT TAKES QUITE A FEW ROLLS EVEN A SMALL ROOM IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MATCH A DESIGN AND I
YES THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED AND I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT I GOT A MICKEY MOUSE PRINT IS WHAT I GOT AND SO A LOT IS WASTED
SO YOU'D KNOW HOW I SEE I DIDN'T EVEN THINK TO LOOK FOR THAT  AND THEN THE
ONE OF THEM WAS JUST A  DIFFERENT COLOR DIFFERENT COLOR PINK IS WHAT IT ENDED UP BEING
AND I
NO I DIDN'T IS THAT HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
I STARTED AT ONE EDGE AND WENT OVER
THEN YOU HAD TO CUT AROUND THE CLOSET
AND CUT AROUND A WINDOW
BUT UH
AND START RIGHT THERE
IT SEEM TO GET IT STRAIGHTER IS THAT THE ADVANTAGE OR WHAT'S THE
OUR MOST RECENT UH
IN SERIES OF PROJECTS I GUESS WAS INSIDE WAS UH WE REMODELED THE BATHROOM RECENTLY
WELL IT WENT PRETTY WELL UM OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE ENCOUNTERED SOME UH PROBLEMS THAT YOU RUN ACROSS IN OLDER HOMES WITH UH PLUMBING
WHICH ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER
AND EVENTUALLY WE ENDED UP REPLACING ALL THE PIPES
FROM THE SINK CLEAR BACK TO THE MAIN DRAIN WHICH MEANT YOU NEED TAKE THE WALL OUT AND START ALL OVER
IT WASN'T ONE OF THOSE
IT STARTED OUT AS A SUNDAY PROJECT AND BY THE BY THE NEXT SUNDAY IT WAS DONE IT WASN'T A ONE-DAYER
BELIEVE ME
YEAH IT'S GOOD FOR ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS
YES
WELL THAT'S THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME BECAUSE ONCE I GOT INTO THE PLUMBING
EVERYTHING IN THERE WAS COPPER AND IT WAS ALL SOLDERED
THAT'S WHAT DROVE ME BANANAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO THE HARDWARE STORE SAYING GIVE ME PLASTIC PIPE AND AND
AND CEMENT
TO FIT THEM TOGETHER AND NOTHING WANTED TO GO SO IT WAS LIKE I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MAIN DRAIN AND START ALL OVER
REALLY
THAT WAS AN ALL DAY JOB JUST TO GET IT PLUMBED
FORTUNATELY I WAS VERY FORTUNATE UH IN THE FACT THAT UH WHEN I MADE THE INSTALLATION OF THE SINK AND EVERYTHING BOLTED UP AND WE TURNED THE WATER ON NOTHING LEAKED
EVERYTHING WORKED AND I JUST SAID THAT'S MARVELOUS I APPRECIATE IT
WELL I EXPECTED SOMETHING TO LEAK YOU KNOW LEFT A FITTING LOOSE OR DIDN'T USE TEFLON TAPE ON ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT IT ALL CAME TOGETHER SO I I FELT PRETTY FORTUNATE ABOUT THAT
HOW ABOUT YOU
UM-HUM
WHAT KIND OF PAINT
UM-HUM
YEAH THAT AND SEMIGLOSS FOR TRIM WORK AND USUALLY FLAT FOR WALLS
WAS IT NOT WASHABLE PAINT
UM-HUM
WHAT COLOR IS IT
PINK OKAY
DID YOU UH REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE CAN OF PAINT
UM-HUM
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MIX PAINT THEN RIGHT
OKAY
UM-HUM YEAH
YEAH BUT YOU ONLY HAD ONE CAN OF PAINT THAT YOU DID THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH
HOW'D THAT GO
KIND OF FUN ISN'T IT
REALLY
REPEATING PATTERNS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK FOR WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BUY YOUR PAPER
YEAH
NORMALLY IT WILL TELL YOU ON THE ROLL HOW OFTEN A PATTERN REPEATS
YEAH
HM
WHEN YOU DID YOUR PAPERING DID YOU START IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL
OR DID YOU START AT THE EDGE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I'VE HAD MY BEST LUCK IN PAPERING WHEN I START IN THE MIDDLE OF A WALL AND I'LL START WITH A PLUMB LINE
AND START IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL AND AND GO FROM THERE
AND GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM
WELL YOU YOU
WELL UH DOWN HERE IN WE'VE GOT UM
TRIALS BY UH JURY IN CRIMINAL CASES AND THE SENTENCING CAN BE DONE BY THE
JURY NORMALLY ALTHOUGH THE JUDGE CAN SOMETIMES DO IT HOW DO Y'ALL DO IT UP THERE
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THE- UH IN FEDERAL COURT THEY HAVE A UNIFORM SENTENCING
GUIDELINES THAT PRETTY WELL LEAVE IT UP TO THE UH JUDGE TO ASSESS THE PUNISHMENT IN A CERTAIN RANGE
RIGHT HERE IN THE DALLAS AREA IF YOU ARE SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS OR LESS TO INCARCERATION IN IN THE UH PENITENTIARY
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT TO THE PENITENTIARY AND YOU'LL SERVE ABOUT A YEAR IN THE COUNTY JAIL AND THEN BE RELEASED BECAUSE OF THE JAIL OVERCROWDING
WELL THE JUDGE HAS A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT IS
PROBABLE RANGES FOR THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF OFFENSE WHERE A JURY IS JUST DOING IT FOR ONE TIME
WELL YOU KNOW IN IN CIVIL CASES THEY CAN HAVE UH AS FEW AS TEN OF THE JURORS AGREE ON A VERDICT BUT CRIMINAL NORMALLY REQUIRES UNANIMOUS
THEY MIGHT MAKE A CHANGE ON THAT AND THAT MIGHT MAKE FOR FEWER MISTRIALS
COURSE IN CIVIL CASES TRIAL BY JURY DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK IF YOU HAVE A BIG COMPLEX UH BUSINESS TYPE CASE WHERE A JURY COULD GET TOTALLY LOST
IN A LOT OF THOSE CASES PEOPLE DECIDE TO JUST TRY THE CASE BEFORE A JUDGE AND JUST NOT HAVE A JURY
AND YOU HAD UP THERE NORTH CAROLINA THAT CASE OF THAT LADY WHO POISONING HER VARIOUS HUSBANDS WHAT WAS IT BLANCHARD OR
BLANCHE YES
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THAT
NO I DON'T REMEMBER READING ABOUT THAT
WE'VE GOT A CASE GOING HERE WHERE A MAN IS ACCUSED OF POISONING HIS WIFE WITH ARSENIC NOW AND THE JURY THE CASE WENT TO THE JURY TODAY AND THE JURY'S DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW
WELL THE COLLECTIVE WISDOM OF THE JURY USUALLY PREVAILS
UM WE USUALLY DO IT UH THE JURY COMES TO THE VERDICT AND THEN THE JUDGE DOES THE SENTENCING
UM I THINK THE JURY CAN RECOMMEND SOMETHING BUT
IN  YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES LIKE UH MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE BUT I THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS TH- IS THE DECISION OF THE JUDGE ONCE THE
VERDICT HAS BEEN REACHED THE JURY'S DISMISSED
AND THERE'S A SEPARATE HEARING FOR SENTENCING
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK IT'S CURIOUS THAT  THE SENTENCES THAT ARE HANDED DOWN ARE USUALLY NOT SERVED
I THINK THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT
YEAH
WELL I I UNDERSTAND THE JAIL OVERCROWDING ISSUE BUT
I- I THINK IN I- IN THAT CASE A- AS AS IN SO MANY ALL THEY EVER DO IS DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS AND THEY NEVER DO ANYTHING TO SOLVE THEM
I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS COUNTRY'S IN THE SHAPE IT'S IN NOW BUT I I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT A JURY
SHOULD DO THE SENTENCING I THINK
YEAH I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT JURORS HAVE THE
THE KNOWLEDGE THE SCOPE AND THE KNOWLEDGE  TO TO HANDLE THE SENTENCING WHEREAS THE JUDGE DOES
THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE
I JUST I- I MEA- I DON'T AGREE WITH JURIES DOING THE SENTENCING BUT I DO AGREE WITH TRIAL  TRIAL BY JURY I JUST THINK THAT'S CRITICAL
RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT CAN THAT MAKES SENSE TOO BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE AWFULLY HARD TO PICK
JURORS THAT COULD FOLLOW SOMETHING AS I- IN A CIVIL CASE I MEAN THAT WAS REALLY COMPLICATED AND HAD A LOT OF TECHNICAL ISSUES IN IT BUT THEY  THERE ARE A LOT OF CRIMINAL CASES A LOT OF MURDER CASES AN-
THAT  THAT ARE REALLY VERY COMPLICATED AND THEY SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THOSE
BLANCHE TAYLOR MOORE
YEAH
YEAH WE UH HAVE YOU HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT  TRIAL THAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON NOW WITH THE UH
THE MAN THAT'S ACCUSED OF MOLESTING TWENTY THREE CHILDREN AT A DAY CARE CENTER
WELL THAT'S THE UH THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHILD MALESTATION CASES IN THE IN THE NATION'S HISTORY
THIS MAN AND HIS WIFE IT IT'S A TRIAL BY JURY BUT IT'S REALLY GOING REAL RAGGED I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE DOING IT
AND THEY GO- THEY HE HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT CHARGES AGAINST HIM
AND HIS ATTORNEY'S MANAGED TO GET IT REDUCED TO NINETY THREE
BUT THE JURY IN THAT CASE THEY'VE JUST ABSOLUTELY SEQUESTERED THEM
NOBODY EVEN UNLESS YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION AT THE VERY BEGINNING YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES AND THEY UH UH FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING IN THE PAPER THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GONNA
DO THE SENTENCING IN THAT
ARSENIC IS UH THIS THIS BLANCHE TAYLOR MOORE WOMAN WAS VERY CLEVER SHE DID IT VERY SLOWLY OVER A LARGE PERIOD A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AT LEAST IT WAS
IT WAS DONE VERY SLOWLY OVER A LARGE PERIOD OF TIME
AND SINCE THE JURY HAS
FOUND HER GUILTY NOW THE JUDGE DID THE SENTENCING IN THAT AND SHE'S APPEALING BUT
I'M ASSUMING THAT SHE'S GUILTY BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE JURY SYSTEM
YEAH HOPEFULLY THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH NOT TO BE HOODWINKED BY
BOY SCOUT HUH YEAH DO Y- DO YOU BACKPACK CAR CAMP
MY SON'S TWELVE AND HE'S IN THE BOY SCOUT AND HE WENT ON HIS FIRST BACKPACK FIVE MILES I'VE GONE WITH HIM ON UH SOME OTHER THINGS WHERE W-
WE KIND OF CALLED IT CAR CAMPING WHERE THE CAR IS YOU KNOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY OR SOMETHING
BUT I DID NOT GO ON THE BACKPACK I'M UH MY BACK WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO  CARRY THAT SO
HE GOT THE BACKPACK IN AND CARRIED THE WHOLE THING AND DO IT THE BOY SCOUT WAY AND HE CAME BACK TIRED AND WORE OUT BUT WHA- I DIDN'T MY SCOUTING WAS NOT AS INVOLVED AS I'D WANT I GOT THE STAR AND THAT WAS IT
BUT I'M HOPING HE'LL GO ALL THE WAY HIS TROOP IS VERY ACTIVE AND THERE'S ABOUT AS MANY DADS INVOLVED AS GOING OUT CAMPING AND CANOEING AS THERE ARE BOYS SO
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART ARE YOU INVOLVED IN INDIAN GUIDES OR INDIAN PRINCESS WITH YOUR CHILDREN
UM-HUM
DOES
WE'VE DONE RENT A TENT IN ARKANSAS ONCE WHERE IT WAS A STATE PARK AND THEY HAVE VERY NICE MANICURED
WELL PAVED PARK AND BEAUTIFUL UH
UH BATHROOMS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE AND YOU RENT A SITE AND THEY RENT A TENT THAT'S AND YOU PUT YOUR TE- WELL ONE TENT'S ALREADY UP
AND THAT'S NOT VERY ROUGH AT ALL YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY AND RU- RUNNING WATER RIGHT THERE BUT UH
YOU MENTIONED THE WORD ROUGH MY IDEA OF ROU- MY WIFE'S IDEA OF ROUGHING IT IS IF THE TOWN ONLY HAS ONE HOLIDAY INN TO CHOOSE FROM AND SHE JU- FEELS LIKE SHE'S BEING -POSED UPON
UH I KIND OF AT MY AGE I KIND OF LIKE THE CAR CAR CAR UH CAMPING
UH UH MY SISTER AND HER HUSBAND UH THEIR CHILDREN ARE OUT OF COLLEGE BY GOSH THEY'RE ALREADY INTO THIS UH WELL CAR CAMPING PLUS THEY WILL LEAVE THE CAR A FEW MILES AWAY
AND UH BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ENJOYING THAT SO UH WE'VE GONE CABIN CAMPING IN COLORADO
UH WHERE THERE'S A UH YOU YOU UH HAVE ALL THE CONVENIENCES BUT YOU CAMP IN THE CABIN AND THAT'S NOT CAMPING AT ALL IN YOUR OPINION
WELL I HOPE YOU FIND MORE PLACES TO GO CAMPING
HAVE YOU CHE- CHECKED INTO THE STATE PARK SYSTEM
SLEEPING ON THE GROUND THAT WHOLE BIT HUH
SCREENED IN SHELTERS WORK HER UP TO SCREENED IN SHELTERS THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START FROM IN A YEAH A COT AND THEN SLOWLY BREAK HER IN I DON'T THINK MY WIFE WOULD EVEN CONSIDER GOING TO A TENT CAMP AGAIN AT ALL IT'S JUST
ONE TIME WE DID GO THAT THING UH THERE WE CAME BACK FROM AN EVENT AND TURNED THE LIGHTS ON AROUND THE CAMP SITE AND THERE'S A SKUNK RIGHT
AND WITHOUT THINKING I PICKED UP A STICK AND THREW IT AT IT AS I- AS IT WAS STARTING TO VOLUNTARILY WALK AWAY WHY I DIDN'T LET IT BUT I THREW A STICK AT IT
IT TURNED AROUND AND IF A SKUNK GIVE YOU A DIRTY LOOK IT DID AND I SAID I DONE MADE A MISTAKE
I SAID PLEASE SKUNK GO ON AND HE LOOKED LOOKED AT ME A LITTLE BIT MORE THEN WANDERED ON OFF VERY VERY SLOWLY AS MY WIFE AND CHILDREN HEADED FOR THE NEAREST TENT TO
UH PEOPLE WE'D GO DOWN TO THE COAST EVERY NOW AND THEN AND WE'VE NOTICED SOME PEOPLE CAMP OUT ON THE BEACH ON PUBLIC BEACHES AND UH
UH PUBLIC BEACHES STATE OF TEXAS BEACHES NOT WHERE IT'S CITY OWNED PROPERTY
WELL I TELL YOU WHAT UH MY MY UH NOTION OF CAMPING IS UH
UH WELL I HAVEN'T BEEN VERY FAR OUT SEE I'VE BEEN IN THE UH HILL COUNTRY THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS I'VE GONE AS FAR AS CAMPING SO I HAVEN'T DONE ANY REALLY REALLY ROUGH RUGGED CAMPING
BUT UH YEAH TO ME IT'S THE UH PITCHING A TENT AND I MEAN WE WE'RE TALKING REAL ROUGHING IT NO CABIN NO JOHNS NOTHING JUST BEING OUT THERE IN THE WOODS YEAH THAT'S IT EXACTLY NO UH I DON'T
NO ACTUALLY THE ONLY CAMPING I EVER DID WAS WAS WHEN I WAS A SCOUT AND UH AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW TO DO IT I
YOU KNOW DON'T REALLY HAVE THE TIME RIGHT NOW BUT I'VE GOT TWO YOUNG BOYS AND I'M WAITING FOR THEM TO GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER THEN WE'LL START DOING SOME CAMPING
OH GREAT
UM-HUM
OH I SEE
UM-HUM
YEAH
THAT'S GREAT
YEAH THAT'S GREAT
NO NOT YET BUT I'LL TELL YOU I- I KNOW I WAS WHEN I WAS SMALLER I STARTED OUT INDIAN GUIDES AND THEN WENT INTO CUB CUB FOR A VERY SHORT TIME
AND THEN WE KIND OF I KIND OF GOT AWAY FROM IT FOR A WHILE AND THEN UH WHEN I GOT BACK INTO IT AGAIN I WAS READY FOR FOR BOY SCOUTS AND I JOI- JOINED THE SCOUTS
BUT I TELL YOU I- I SURE UH RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY ANY ANY YOUNG BOY GIRL TOO I MEAN I- I REALLY ENJOYED MY TIME IN THE SCOUTS
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH I THINK FOR A FAMILY OUTING IT'S GOOD
UH BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WITH A BUNCH OF UH PRETEEN AND AND YOUNG TEENAGERS WHO REALLY WANT TO ROUGH IT YEAH I I'D RECOMMEND GOING THE OLD BACKPACK METHOD
YEAH
YEAH I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT YOU KNOW I- I REALLY DID ENJOY MY EXPERIENCE AND I I'M HOPING MY BOYS'LL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID
NO NOT YET BUT I TELL YOU I- I KNOW MY WIFE SHE HASN'T SHE REALLY WASN'T UH WELL HER FAMILY
THEY USED TO GO CAMPING QUITE A BIT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER THEN AS SHE GOT OLDER THEY KIND OF STOPPED GOING AND AND SHE'S EXPRESSED INTEREST IN GOING AND DOING SOME CAMPING SO
BUT PRO- YEAH PROBABLY NOT THAT ROUGH WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING PROBABLY TENTS
YEAH WITH C- WITH WITH COTS YEAH AN-
UM-HUM
OH NO
UH-OH
YEAH
REALLY
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT
OH
OH NOT LIKE CORP-
YES
YES
YES BUT I THINK IT CAUSES A LOT OF DYSFUNCTION IN THE FAMILY
WOMEN GOING OUT TO WORK
FOR THE MONEY
YEAH
I DO TOO WHEN IT'S A NECESSITY I KNOW UH BUT IT'S FUNNY HOW IT'S CHANGED BECAUSE WHEN MY MOTHER
UH GRAD- WELL SHE TOOK ONE YEAR OF NORMAL SCHOOL AND THEN SHE TAUGHT SCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS BEFORE UH SHE MET MY FATHER AND THEY MARRIED AND SHE HAD TO QUIT TEACHING SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS A MARRIED WOMAN
SO IT IT'S CHANGED A LOT FROM THEN
UM-HUM
RIGHT
NO NO I DON'T EITHER I JUST THINK THAT WELL MEN ARE JUST KIND OF IN CHARGE AND THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TO LET WOMEN
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
PARENT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL I THINK THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE AND I THINK IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TOO IF IF AFTER YOUR CHILDREN ARE RAISED UH YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND FULFILL YOURSELF
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YES I DEFINITELY THINK SO AND ESPECIALLY UH IN THOSE FAMILIES THAT THE HUSBAND DOES NOT HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION
THEY ARE IN UTAH TOO
OH IS IT  QUITE AS BAD IN UTAH AS IT IS THROUGHOUT THE NATION
UH-HUH
OH
UH-HUH
RIGHT I- I THINK THAT THAT'S MORE THOUGH WITH A MOTHER THAT'S WORKING
THAN THAN JUST A WIFE BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT JUST A WIFE BUT A WIFE I I'M GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF MY DAUGHTERS-IN-LAWS AT THIS TIME ARE WORKING
OKAY THE CHANGE HOW WOMEN'S ROLES HAVE CHANGED
UH WELL I THINK WE'VE MOVED OUT OF THE STEREOTYPE OF THE HOMEMAKER UH AND I THINK IT'S BEEN THROUGH NECESSITY
WITH THE ECONOMY AND WITH THE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES
WELL
UH POSSIBLY YOU KNOW IF IF THEY'RE DOING IT SIMPLY UM
FOR THE MONEY I THINK YOU KNOW THAT
IF IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO FULFILL THEMSELVES THEN THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT TOO
THAT UH THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AND THE QUOTE HOMEMAKER'S ROLE SHOULD BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE PARTNERS
UH-HUH  THAT'S RIGHT
AND OF COURSE NOW WOMEN CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO
UH ONE THING THAT HAS NOT CHANGED IS
IS THE EQUALITY OF PAY AMONG THE SEXES
AND UH I DON'T SEE ANY GREAT HOPE FOR THAT BEING CHANGED IN THE NEAR FUTURE QUITE FRANKLY
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE DECISIONS
UH THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE THEY'RE PRIMARILY MALE
AND UH
YOU KNOW BIG DECISION MAKERS ARE STILL MALE UNTIL WE GET THAT CHANGED  YOU KNOW I'M A SINGLE
PARENT WELL A SINGLE PERSON MY CHILDREN ARE ARE GROWN AND MARRIED BUT UH I STILL HAVE TO SUPPORT MYSELF
AND I YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY I DON'T WORK BECAUSE I WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND DO IT I WORK BECAUSE IF I WANT TO EAT I'M OUT THERE WORKING
WELL I DID I DIDN'T WORK WHILE MY CHILDREN WERE YOUNG AND I WAS MARRIED BECAUSE I DID WANT TO GIVE THEM THE BACKGROUND THAT THEY GOT AT HOME I DID FIND AFTERWARDS THOUGH
YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN WHOSE YOU KNOW IN A IN A HEALTHY FAMILY WHICH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF US HAVE HEALTHY FAMILIES ANYMORE  UH BUT I DID FIND THAT THE CHILDREN OF WORKING PARENTS
OR WORKING PARENT UH WERE MORE INDEPENDENT
AND MAYBE THAT GOES TO WHERE IT BREAK IT'S BREAKING DOWN THE FAMILY BONDS BUT I DON'T KNOW OF TOO MANY FAMILIES THAT THE WOMEN REALLY WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
UH MOST OF THEM
ARE WORKING AND IT'S NOT TO BUY THE TVS AND THE NEW CARS IT'S TO SURVIVE
WELL EVEN YOU KNOW HERE OUR TEACHERS ARE PAID SO POORLY
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY TEACHER WHOSE WIFE IS NOT HAVING TO WORK
SO IT'S IT'S NOT JUST THE MEN WITHOUT A COLLEGE EDUCATION IT'S
OUR ECONOMY IS REALLY BAD RIGHT NOW IN OKLAHOMA IT'S REAL BAD
YES
WELL OKLAHOMA IS CERTAINLY IN THE RECESSION
UH WE'VE BEEN THERE WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT THREE TO FIVE YEARS NOW AND IT'S REALLY HURTING
BUT UH YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY WOMAN WOULD CHOOSE THAT A MARRIED WOMAN WOULD REALLY CHOOSE TO WORK BECAUSE
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AND YOU'RE MARRIED YOU'RE HOLDING DOWN TWO JOBS ONE AT HOME AND ONE AT
WELL YES
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UH-HUH RIGHT
UH-HUH
YEAH I THINK WE'RE KIND OF MY FAMILY'S IN THE SAME SITUATION MY MY GRANDMOTHER
IS ABOUT NINETY TWO RIGHT NOW AND JUST REALLY HAS LOST HER SENSES SHE'S GONE SENILE AND WE BASICALLY TAKE CARE OF HER BETWEEN MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND OURSELVES AND MY UNCLE LIVES IN IN UTAH SO
IT'S REALLY IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR OUR FAMILY BECAUSE MY PARENTS STILL HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG KIDS AND IT'S REALLY TOUGH FOR THEM TO
TO HANDLE MY GRANDMA AS WELL AS
AS WELL AS UM THE REST OF THE FAMILY
NO NOT AT ALL WE'RE WE BASICALLY PUSH HER AROUND AND SHE'S LOST CONTROL OF HER BOWEL AND IT'S JUST IT'S REALLY SAD AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU SAID THAT
WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT SOME NURSING HOMES AND AND JUST THE SITUATIONS THAT I'VE SEEN IS MOST OF THE TIME WHEN THERE ARE WHEN THEY THEY GO INTO THE NURSING HOMES THEY JUST LOSE EVEN MORE THAN WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE
UH-HUH
YEAH AND REALLY YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HELP THEM BE PRODUCTIVE BUT BASICALLY WHAT THEY ALL DO IS THEY LAY ON THEIR BEDS ALL DAY
AND IT JUST TO ME THAT SEEMS REALLY SAD
UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S KIND OF A CHALLENGE I GUESS
YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THEY BIG THING IS JUST TO FIND A NURSING HOME THAT REALLY CARES FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY THEY'RE BRINGING IN BUT IT'S IT'S MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN THING WHERE THEY WANT TO HELP THESE PEOPLE HAVE THE BEST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES THAT ARE LEFT
AND I THINK THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM PERSONALLY
YEAH
YEAH AND SEE THAT'S I COULDN'T DO IT I THINK THAT THAT'D BE SUPER TOUGH JUST BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LEARN TO LOVE YOU SEE DYING OFF ONE BY ONE AND I THINK THAT WOULD JUST BE REALLY I ADMIRE THOSE WHO CAN I COULDN'T HANDLE THAT PERSONALLY
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
AND I THINK AS YOU LEARN TO KNOW THE VOLUNTEERS AND HELP THEM KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY I GUESS THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TOO
I I REALLY DON'T TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I'M JUST SEEN I'VE DONE SOME WORK IN NURSINGS HOMES AND I'VE KIND OF
BUT IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS I DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY
UH FRUIT AND SUPPOSED SANITATION TYPE THINGS BUT
I JUST IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I'VE SUNG A LOT AND SO E- ALMOST EVERY CHRISTMAS AND EVERY HOLIDAY YOU CAN THINK OF WE'VE GONE IN AND SANG AT NURSING HOMES AND
IT'S SAD BECAUSE REALLY THEY'RE NOT AN- TO ME AT LEAST IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY'RE VERY WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND ANY OF THEM THAT
BUT
YEAH I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT AND I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING FOR THEM THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A FIND SOME PLACE WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AROUND THEM REALLY AND TRULY LOVE THEM
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL WANTED AND THEY'RE STILL THEY CAN STILL BE A PRODUCTIVE PART OF SOCIETY
AND I THINK TOO OFTEN THE NURSING HOME FOR EXAMPLE MY GRANDMA'S CASE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO A NURSING HOME BECAUSE TO HER THAT'S JUST A SIGN OF LOSING EVERYTHING AND COM- BEING COMPLETELY UNPRODUCTIVE FOREVER
UH-HUH

HI UH HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GUN CONTROL

BECAUSE I THINK THAT UH AND IT DOESN'T HURT PEOPLE TO HAVE A WAITING PERIOD
YES  RIGHT
UH-HUH BUT I
KILL A
UH
YES I REMEMBER WHEN THAT HAPPENED
SO THERE ISN'T REALLY A GUN CONTROL THERE
NO
WELL I I THINK THAT EVERY GUN SHOULD BE COVERED FROM RIFLES AND THE AUTOMATICS AND AND HANDGUNS BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED IF THEY'RE OUT AFTER A GUN THEY NEED A COOLING OFF PERIOD
WE HAVE GUNS IN OUR HOME BUT MY HUSBAND UH USED TO HUNT ALL MY SONS HUNT
OH WE HAVE
SOMETIMES I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT AS DANGEROUS BUT UH
YEAH

UH SHRUBS DURING THE WINTER

OH MY HECK
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TWENTY WELL IT'S ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HERE
NO
BUT I- I'M I
WELL DON'T YOU THINK TOO IF THE GOVERNMENT I MEAN LIKE IN YUGOSLAVIA AND THESE PLACES THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMES IN AND TAKES OVER CHINA DON'T YOU THINK IF THE PEOPLE HAD A GUN THEY WOULD HAVE MORE SAY IN IN IN ESTABLISHING A DEMOCRACY
YEAH UH-HUH
THEN THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIDDEN SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THEY CAME OUT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH UH-HUH
IS THAT RIGHT
OH
OH
NO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE IS REGISTRATION AND GUNS THAT CAN BE TRACED
BUT THEN
NO
I THINK THEY HAVE UM
AND YOU JUST HAND OVER THE CASH AND THAT'S IT
UH-HUH WELL I'M ABOUT AN EIGHT ON THAT I THINK THAT UH THAT WE NEED GUN CONTROL BUT YOU KNOW SO MANY LAWS WOULD BE UH NECESSARY IF WE'D JUST USE COMMON SENSE
YOU KNOW JUST REGISTERING THE GUNS AND WOW I DON'T KNOW I GUESS PEOPLE LOSE THEIR COMMON SENSE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GET MAD OR WHEN THEY
UH-HUH UH-HUH
OH REALLY
THA- THAT YOU'RE IN THE BAR AND SOMEBODY HAS A GUN NEXT TO YOU
OH I DON'T LIKE A TOTAL BAN ON IT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T LIKE TOTAL IDIOTS PULLING WHAT THEY DID DOWN IN UH MY HOME STATE OF TEXAS DOWN IN UH NEAR FORT HOOD
UH I THINK THE RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH WRONG WITH HAVING IT REGISTERED AND HAVING YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT
UM
WELL THEY MAKE US WAIT TO GET MARRIED IN MOST STATES I DON'T
UNLESS YOU WANT TO FLY TO LAS VEGAS OR SO
YEAH UH
IT'S JUST SICKENING I WAS ON THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS CAMPUS WHEN THAT CHAPMAN CLIMBED THE TOWER AND KILLED TWENTY TWO PEOPLE ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS WOUNDED AND HE WAS FROM
LA PAZ BOLIVIA AND THEY FLEW AND GOT HIS MOTHER HERE REAL QUICK BUT AND A HIPPIE PULLED HIM OUT OF THE OUT OF THE ADDITIONAL GUNSHOT RANGE SO EVER SINCE THEN OLD OSCAR SAID HIPPIES ARE OKAY MY BUDDY
IT WAS BACK IN THE SIXTIES WHEN VIETNAM WAS GOING ON SO
SO I'VE LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE THEY HAVE A UH PISTOL CONTROL AND UH
BIG DEAL YOU GO ACROSS THE COUNTY LINE INTO YONKERS AND YOU CAN BUY A PISTOL AND COME BACK INTO THE CITY
NOT REALLY
UH
YEAH
UM I'VE GOT A SHOTGUN AND A PISTOL
AND THE KIDS HAVE BBS
WELL I'D SHOOT IT MORE OFTEN IT WASN'T AGAINST THE CITY ORDINANCE THOSE BIRDS STEAL MY DOG'S BIRD DOG FOOD MY I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR
UM
DO THEY REALLY
WE GOT THE AIR-CONDITIONING GOING IN THE BUILDING TODAY
IT MUST BE SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES OUT THERE
I DON'T THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH GUN CONTROL
UH
I I DON'T THINK IT'S A CONS- WELL SO WHAT IF IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT I- I- IF MY WIFE DRIVES TO WEST TEXAS ALONE SHE'S GOING TO CARRY A GUN I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY
UH-HUH
WASN'T THAT AMAZING YUGOSLAVIA WAS A SEMI SOVIET STATE AND NO GUNS WERE ALLOWED AND ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY HAS ONE THAT WANTS TO FIGHT THE WAR WHERE DID THEY COME FROM
THEY WERE HIDDEN UNDER THE BED ALL THESE YEARS
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW
WELL YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT THE KILLEEN SITUATION THAT WAS POINTED UP IS THERE WERE A LOT OF MILITARY PEOPLE IN THE  IN AND AROUND
UH IF THE MILITARY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO CARRY EVEN SIDE ARMS THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS IDIOT QUICKER
UH
I HAD A COP ONCE SAY
IN TEXAS IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW LET'S SEE WHAT I SAY I SAID IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT LEGALLY IF I PUT ON A A SIDE GUN AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH A GUN STRAPPED ON MY SIDE IT'S CLEAR VIEW AND YOU COULDN'T ARREST ME HE SAID YES I CAN ARREST YOU I SAID WHAT FOR HE SAID BREAKING THE PEACE I SAID WHO'S PEACE AM A BOTHERING HE SAID MINE I'M THE COP
THAT WAS THAT WAS A JOKE IT WAS A JOKE
BUT I THINK IF YOU TAKE THEM AWAY FROM EVERYBODY THEN ONLY CRIMINALS WILL HAVE IT AND YOU WOULD HAVE MORE PROBLEMS BUT BUT REGISTRATION WON'T HURT ANYBODY WILL IT
YEAH YOU CAN GO TO PAWNSHOP I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL LIVE NEAR BIG CITY SALT LAKE CITY IF THEY'VE GOT THEM OR NOT BUT YOU GO TO A PAWNSHOP AND BUY IT FOR CASH AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW NOTHING
YEAH YOU IF YOU CAN SHOW THEM A DRIVER'S LICENSE BUT YOU CAN STEAL THOSE SO EASILY IT'S PITIFUL
UM-HUM
GET TOO DRUNK
I'LL BE THERE'S A LAW IN TEXAS SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM IN BAR I THINK IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE SENSE IF THEY SAY PLEASE CHECK THEM AT THE FRONT DOOR BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE ARE IN THERE WITH THEM ON
OH YEAH I IT JUST NERVE RACKING TO KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE IN A
YEAH
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BUT THEN AGAIN SO
RIGHT
PROBABLY FIND SOMEONE HOW COME YOU WOULDN'T TAKE THEM TO A DAY CARE JUST BECAUSE OF THE
YEAH THEY SEEM TO PASS A LOT A
YEAH YOU KIND OF WONDER WHETHER OR NOT
I TOOK UH CAMMY TO A
OH IT WAS A PRESCHOOL DAY CARE TYPE OF THING
BUT I KIND OF I LIKED IT IN SOME WAYS AND SOME WAYS I DIDN'T UM I THINK THE RATIO OF KIDS TO TEACHER IS REALLY IMPORTANT
AND
WELL
I THINK THEY HAD A
THEY HAD TWO TEACHERS AND I THINK THERE WERE TWENTY KIDS
BUT I ONLY HAD HER GOING TWO DAYS AND MOST THE OTHER KIDS WERE GOING MORE DAYS
SO THAT WAS PROBABLY MY OWN FAULT
THAT SHE DIDN'T OH YOU KNOW ONE THING I NOTICED IS UH
UM JUST THEY WERE TRYING TO GET HER TO TEACH HER TO WRITE HER NAME
AND UH I DIDN'T NOTICE IT UNTIL THIS SUMMER WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH HER THAT SHE'D BEND HER WRIST ALL THE WAY OH NOT IN A NATURAL SH- FORM
YES AND UH I WAS KIND OF M- MAD THAT THEY HAD NEVER NOTICED THAT AND EITHER POINTED IT OUT TO ME OR
OR UH TRIED TO SAY LOOK YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR SHE'S HOLDING HER PENCIL IN THE RIGHT FINGERS AND STUFF SH- BUT SHE WAS
YES
AND UH I HADN'T WORKED WITH HER ON WRITING AT ALL AT THAT POINT SHE WAS FOUR
OR THREE YEAH SHE WAS UH IT WAS LAST YEAR
AND UH THEN THIS SUMMER I GOT THE THING FROM THE SCHOOL THAT SAYS THINGS TO WORK WITH THE KIDS ON AND I WOR- LIKE I SAID I DIDN'T NOTICE IT TILL THEN
BECAUSE I HADN'T WORKED WITH WRITING LETTERS OR ANYTHING AND
STUFF LIKE THAT
NO THEY NEVER
COURSE LIKE I SAID I TOOK HER TWO DAYS A WEEK AND MAYBE THAT WAS MY MAIN REASON FOR TAKING  HER WAS UM JUST SOCIAL SKILLS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
I FELT SHE NEEDED THE S-
JUST I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE WAS MATURE ENOUGH SOCIALLY AND
UM
UM-HUM
OH YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO TAKE THEM TO PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW
PRESCHOOL'S A DIFFERENT THING BUT I THINK IT'S HARD TO TAKE KIDS TO SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW AND OR UNLESS YOU HAVE AWFULLY GOOD REFERENCES
RELIABLE UM
PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW IT'S SO HARD TO TAKE YOUNG KIDS ANYWHERE FOR VERY LONG
IT IS THE OLDER ONES IT'S NOT YOU DON'T EVEN REALLY HAVE ANY
REAL WORRIES BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THEY'LL PLAY WITH WHOEVER'S THERE AND THEY USUALLY ADAPT PRETTY WELL
BUT UH
WELL AND YOU KNOW THEIR KIND OF THEIR SCHEDULES AND YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE UPSET AND
THAT TYPE OF A DEAL
I DON'T KNOW HOW UM PEOPLE UH THAT HAVE YOUNG KIDS WORK AND WORK FULL TIME AND
AND DO IT REALLY WITHOUT BEING STRESSED OUT ALL THE TIME I THINK IT'S
WELL I DON'T KNOW
THEN THEN ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK IT'S HARDER TO STAY HOME IN SOME REGARDS
IT'S HARD TO
ALWAYS KEEP YOURSELF FEELING LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE AND
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUR HOUSE STILL FEELS LIKE IT'S A MESS AND YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING DONE AND WHAT AM I GONNA FIX FOR SUPPER
YEAH IT'S KIND OF HARD TO ALWAYS FEEL LIKE GOSH WHAT I- IS THIS IMPORTANT WHAT I'M DOING AND
NO NO IT
IT DOESN'T
BUT I THINK THAT TAKING KIDS TO A PROBABLY PEOPLE THAT TAKE THEM TO UH PRESCHOOLS AND DAY CARES FULL TIME
OH THEY WOULD  I DON'T KNOW
PROBABLY JUST FEEL A DIFFERENT UH
I THINK I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO DO THAT FULL TIME I FEEL SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY EVEN WHEN WE GO OUT FOR A FEW HOURS THAT ARE THEY DRIVING THE BABYSITTER CRAZY AND
YOU KNOW WHA-
OH  WELL MY MY FEELINGS ON ARE IT IS UH I WOULDN'T TAKE A CHILD TO A DAY CARE
YOU KNOW I MEAN I'D I'D WIND UP UM JUST A BABYSITTER IN A HOME
U- UM
WELL TOO MANY KIDS AND AND I THINK TOO MANY INFECTIONS AND THINGS COMING IN
YEAH SICKNESSES AND I DON'T KNOW THEN ALL THE THINGS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM AN-
YEAH I MEAN I'M SURE THERE'S SOME GOOD ONES BUT I JUST I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD HUM
OH UH-HUH
OH YEAH YEAH HOW WAS IT
OH
SH- SHE WENT
OH SHE DID
UH WRAPPING HER ARM ALL THE WAY AROUN- YEAH
OH
UH-HUH
WELL THEY'D NEVER PICKED IT OUT THOUGH HUH OR JUST NEVER SAID ANYTHING
YEAH YEAH
A INFANT UNDER TO A DAY CARE WHERE THEY'RE -KEN CARE OF
YEAH YEAH
WELL I THINK IT'S HARD TO LEAVE THEM IT IS
YEAH
JUST HARD TO LEAVE THEM BECAUSE NOBODY WILL GIVE THEM THE KIND OF CARE THEIR OWN FAMILIES WILL UM
YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH
OH YEAH THAT IS UH
YEAH WELL UM THE WORK NEVER ENDS  UH
HUH
UH UH-HUH OR IS EVERYTHING OKAY
OKAY
UM THAT'S RIGHT
WHAT WOULD WE LIKE TO SAY  I THINK
UM-HUM
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE SUBJECT IS ABOUT
IN THE DALLAS THE MORNING TIMES I GUESS I DID NOT
WELL IT'S BEEN INTERESTING THAT WE
YES
SO WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THOUGH WHERE EVERYONE IF YOU ASK THEM ON POLLS WILL UM SAY THAT THEY THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE
AND YET I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER QUITE DECIDED WHO'S REALLY SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR IT AND
WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WE OUGHT TO JUST ADMIT IT PERHAPS AND THEN TRY AND SOMEHOW SUBSIDIZE IT IN A WAY THAT'S MORE FAIR
YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH YOUR COMPANY
OH MY GOODNESS
THAT MUST'VE BEEN HORRI-
HOW WAS YOUR CARE AT PARKLAND
BUT CAMP PARKLAND IS NOT FREE EITHER
IS IT AFFORDABLE
SO YOU DID HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE
IS YOUR WIFE BETTER I HOPE
I'M REAL SORRY
SURE IT DOES HAPPEN BUT IT'S VERY SAD
ACTUALLY UM I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT UM CHILDREN AND UM DEVELOPED VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS DURING OUR MEASLES EPIDEMIC LAST YEAR
WHERE WE CERTAINLY PROVED THAT WE'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB WITH PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AMONG CHILDREN AND PARTICULARLY THE CHILDREN WHO NEED IT MOST
SO UM I'M REALLY QUITE ACTIVE IN TRYING TO UH UH BE PROACTIVE AT LEAST TO FOR CHILDREN'S ISSUES IT'S VERY COMPLEX VERY COMPLICATED BUT
UM I JUST STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO IMMUNIZATION GLASSES HEARING AIDS  BASIC HEALTH BENEFITS
UM
-ELL AND THE COSTS OF SO MUCH HAS GONE UP SO MUCH THE COST OF IMMUNIZATIONS FOR EXAMPLE
UM AND JUST THE LEGAL
THE LEGAL BENEFITS UM THAT HAS REALLY FORCED PEOPLE INTO DOING A LOT OF THINGS UNNECESSARILY ET CETERA
SO WELL I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT IS INTERESTING IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW TEXAS LEADS THE NATION IN UNINSURED CHILDREN THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL TEXAS CHILDREN
DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE AND ARE NOT ON MEDICAID
SO UH ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE CHILDREN HAS NOTHING TO REIMBURSE THEM FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE
AND I WORK IN THE CHILDREN'S PARKLAND SYSTEM AND IT'S PRETTY OVERWHELMING TO ME
BUT UM IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BE INDIGENT AND TO BE DEPENDENT UPON INDIGENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN DALLAS COUNTY
OKAY UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT
UM
WELL I THINK UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE LIKE NATIONAL HEALTH LIKE WHAT CANADA HAS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING THIS SUBJECT IS ABOUT
DID YOU READ UH THE ARTICLE IN THE PAPER TODAY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT
YEAH UH THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
IS UH GOING TO BEGIN TESTING A PROGRAM
A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM FOR CITIZENS OF THOSE TWO STATES
AND THERE'S FOURTEEN OTHER
UH STATES THAT ARE CONSIDERING IT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE IN THE PAPER THIS MORNING
I THINK IT'S A TREND THIS THIS THAT'S UH PROBABLY MAY GO NATIONWIDE EVENTUALLY BECAUSE I THINK NATIONAL HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED IT'S GETTING TO A POINT THAT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME FORM OF HEALTH INSURANCE
AND EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE THOUGH
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S THE THING YOU KNOW UH UNFORTUNATELY THE ONES THAT CURRENTLY PAY AND PAY THE PREMIUMS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE ARE ARE PAYING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE
YEAH
I DON'T THINK YOU UM
YES I DO
UH THROUGH MY COMPANY YES
BUT I HAVE BEEN IN A SITUATION UH RECENTLY WHERE
I WAS LAID OFF FROM A POSITION AS A SALES MANAGER OF A COMPANY AND WAS OFF WORK FOR ABOUT A YEAR
AND MY WIFE DEVELOPED CANCER AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE
AND IT WAS UH
GO TO PARKLAND TYPE SITUATION
UH BECAUSE IT WAS A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION IT WAS VERY GOOD
UH AS I- AS IT TURNED OUT ONE OF THE TOP UM PEOPLE OR ONE OF THE TOP DOCTORS IN THE STATE THAT IS INVOLVED IN CANCER TREATMENT WAS AT PARKLAND
NO IT'S NOT FREE BUT UH
IT'S IT'S A SITUATION THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE AND I WAS ON UNEMPLOYMENT IT WAS PAID BY THE COUNTY
I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE AS IT TURNED OUT
UM I WAS FORTUNATE THAT THERE WAS PARKLAND
UH NO SHE PASSED AWAY OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT HAPPENS
YEAH
BUT IN ANY EVENT UM I'M IN FAVOR OF NATIONAL HEALTH
IF I HAD TO VOTE FOR IT
OH IS THAT RIGHT
UM-HUM UM-HUM
WELL I WHEN I GREW UP AND I GREW UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL KANSAS UM WE HAD AND MY MOM WORKED FOR THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT
AND WE HAD X RAYS EVERY YEAR WE HAD A DENTIST COME TO OUR SCHOOL AND UH CHECK OUR TEETH ONCE A YEAR AT LEAST
UM WE HAD ALL OUR FLU SHOTS TAKEN CARE OF OUR MEASLES MUMPS RUBELLA AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AND UH WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE GROWING UP
WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT WE HAD TO PAY FOR IT WHICH I WASN'T OPPOSED TO PAYING FOR IT I HAD THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT BUT I'M SURE THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT DON'T
UM-HUM
DID NOT KNOW THAT
UM-HUM
SET
YOU YOU GOT THE TOPIC RIGHT OKAY UM WELL WHERE IN DALLAS ARE YOU
OH OKAY SO YOU DO RE- DO RECYCLING THERE OKAY
UM-HUM
UM-HUM ARE THEY GOING TO LATER OR DO YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
HM WELL I'M I'M IN DALLAS PROPER IN THE CITY OF DALLAS AND I KNOW THEY DO HAVE YOU KNOW A PILOT PROGRAM GOING ON BUT IT'S NOT HERE
SO THEY'RE NOT PICKING UP ANYTHING  SO I MEAN WE WE COLLECT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT ALL THESE BOXES IN OUR GARAGE FOR YOU KNOW GREEN GLASS AND CLEAR GLASS AND PLASTIC AND EVERYTHING
BUT UM WELL THERE'S THERE'S A COUPLE PLACES UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T FIND A PLACE THAT'LL TAKE EVERYTHING
UM THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES TO TAKE LIKE THE PLASTIC UM SHOPPING BAGS LIKE MOST OF THE GROCERY STORES AND THERE'S A WAL-MART NEARBY THAT TAKES ALMOST EVERYTHING I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT IS THEY DON'T TAKE
AND THE LIBRARY WILL TAKE GLASS SO WE END UP YOU KNOW ON THE WEEKEND WE PACK IT ALL IN THE CAR AND AND AS WE GO PLACES WE OH WAIT WE CAN DROP THE GLASS OFF  YOU KNOW DROP THINGS OFF ONE AT A TIME
BUT UM AND IT'S KIND OF DISAPPOINTING I MEAN I WOULD EVEN BE HAPPY IF THEY JUST HAD ONE YOU KNOW ONE PLACE WHERE YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IT WOULD STILL BE MORE CONVENIENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW
HM WHERE IS THAT
OH I'M PRETTY FAR NORTH I'M NOT
I'M I'M I'M JUST I'M NORTH OF ADDISON ACTUALLY
SO I'M I'M REALLY
UH-HUH YEAH
YEAH I'VE SEEN THOSE
YEAH
YEP
UH-HUH
WELL YOU GET SOMETHING
UH WE USED TO DO THAT BUT AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER STOP AND IT DOESN'T TAKE PLASTIC BAGS AND AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING BUT UM
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I HEARD THAT IT WAS GOING WELL IN THE PILOT AREA WHEREVER THAT IS AND SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL DO IT SOON THAT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO TRASH PICK UPS A WEEK
WHERE I GREW UP WE ONLY HAD ONE A WEEK AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY SUFFICIENT SO IF THEY JUST DO ONE OF THEM WILL BE TRASH AND THE ALTERNATE TIME WOULD DO RECYCLABLES THAT'D BE GREAT
SO I HOPE THEY DO
UM-HUM
OH
HM
RIGHT
YEAH DO YOU HAVE TO UM SORT THE PAPER AND TAKE OUT THE GLOSSY PAGES AND THAT THAT SORT OF THING OR DO THEY TAKE THE WHOLE THING
OH OKAY
UM-HUM
LET ME GUESS YOU WORK AT TI RIGHT
SO DO I
YEAH
I KNOW

YEAH
WELL TH- AND THEY TAKE CANS NOW TOO WHICH IS GREAT
WELL OUR DEPARTMENT USED TO COLLECT THE CANS ANYWAY FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE PROJECT
AND IN FACT WE GOT THIS PAST YEAR WE GOT ALL OF OUR MONEY FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE BECAUSE WE SAVED CANS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR
AND IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM

I'M NOT SURE THEY ONLY STARTED TO DO THE NEWSPAPER UH LATE LAST YEAR JUST TRY LIKE A TRIAL BASIS AND SEE HOW IT GOES SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO PICK UP THE OTHER THINGS

I THINK THAT WAS CLOSER TO DOWNTOWN UH SHE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE BUT UH YEAH
OH

WELL SOMETIMES WE TAKE OUR UH WE WE ALWAYS KEEP OUR ALUMINUM CANS  AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY TAKE THEM OVER TO ONE OF THESE CAN BANKS
YOU DON'T GET TOO MUCH MONEY BACK I FIGURE IT PAYS FOR THE GAS TO TAKE MY CANS OVER THERE BUT NORMALLY I COLLECT OH LIKE THREE TRASH BAGS FULL
AND I TAKE THEM OVER TO THAT CAN BANK AND IT'S MORE FUN JUST TO KIND OF LIKE CRUNCH THE CANS

BUT I COULD CERTAINLY HAVE UH THREE BINS OUT THERE FOR YOU KNOW PLASTIC AND AND TIN AND PAPER WHATEVER THEY WERE GOING TO UH SEPARATE INTO AND AND HAVE THEM PICK IT UP ON ON ONE OF THE TWO DAYS PER WEEK THAT WOULD BE EASY
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE LIKE THE COUPONS IN THERE

UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE CHANGED OUR RECYCLING AT FIRST THEY WERE KIND OF FINICKY ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PAPER YOU COULD RECYCLE

YOU KNOW THAT WELL THAT'S STUPID AND THEN THEY SAID NO NEWSPAPERS WELL IN THE MY DEPARTMENT EVERYBODY GETS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
THERE WAS LIKE A LOT OF PAPER COMING OUT OF OUR DEPARTMENT THAT WASN'T RECYCLABLE SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD TO EXPAND UPON IT AND SAY ANYTHING PAPER

SHE GOES TO EVERYBODY IN THE MALL AND SAYS THE SAME THING SO I WASN'T TOO FLATTERED
OH WHAT A BUMMER DID YOU EVEN HAVE THE TAG ON THE ITEM
SO THEY WERE PARTICULARLY UH WELL UNCOOPERATIVE
THEY'RE SO SWAMPED THEY LET YOU GET BY YEAH
I THINK WE'VE COVERED IT
AND YOU TOO BYE-BYE
YOU KEEP A BUDGET
OKAY H- HOW DO YOU WORK THAT
DOES IT
OH
RIGHT  UH-HUH
OH
UH-HUH
OH
WELL THAT SEEMS TO WORK OUT PRETTY GOOD
OH
FOR SAVINGS
OH IS I- IS IT HARD TO SET IT UP FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD RATHER THAN JUST A MONTH OR
OH
RIGHT
UH-HUH
SO IN FACT
IT MIGHT
UH-HUH
RIGHT
OH SO REALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT IT PROBABLY IS JUST AS EASY TO DO IT FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD RATHER THAN JUST A MONTH AT A TIME OH
NO
UH-HUH
OH RIGHT AND THEN ALSO I MEAN THAT'S IF YOU DO IT MONTHLY THAT'S TWELVE TIMES YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE IT OUT AND YOU COULD SAVE ALL THAT
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UM-HUM
SO YOU DO IT JANUARY TO JULY AND THEN JULY TO DECEMBER OH OH DOES NOW HOW DID YOU SAY YOU WORKED YOUR SAVINGS DO YOU TAKE YOUR SAVINGS RIGHT OFF
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT RIGHT
AND HOW MUCH AT WHAT PERCENTAGE DO YOU SAVE
OH THAT'S GREAT
WELL THAT THAT'S FAIRLY GOOD DO YOU GET PAID ONCE A MONTH OR BY TWICE A MONTH
EVERY TWO WEEKS
DURING THE YEAR OH THAT'S GREAT WE
OH THAT'S RIGHT SO THAT HELPS OUT
GIVES YOU A BIT THERE OH
WELL WE
WE DON'T REALLY DO VERY WELL WE HAVE NEVER SAT DOWN AND MADE OUT A FORMAL BUDGET WE KEEP SAYING YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE WE TAKE OUR SAVINGS RIGHT OUT  RIGHT OUT FIRST AND PUT YOU KNOW PUT IT AWAY AND THEN
WE JUST UH WE'RE THAT'S TERRIBLE BUT WE JUST KIND OF SPEND WHAT WE NEED THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT WE TAKE THE SAVINGS OUT AND UH YOU KNOW PUT THAT IN AND THEN
SPEND WHAT WHAT'S LEFT OVER LIKE YOU SAID AND I KNOW WE IF WE KEEP BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET DOWN AND GET STARTED I GUESS TRYING TO DECIDE HOW MUCH GOES WHERE AND YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
OH
OH
OH THAT'S GREAT NOW HOW DID YOU GET STARTED WHEN YOU STARTED DO- HAVE YOU ALWAYS DONE A BUDGET OR WHAT
ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OH SO QUITE A WHILE HUH DID YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND DECIDE
THIS MUCH IS THIS MUCH IS GONNA GO HERE AND
THE THING WE HAVE A HARD TIME WITH WAS YOU KNOW LIKE HOW MUCH FOR THE GROCERIES AND HOW MUCH FOR THE CLOTHES AND HOW MUCH FOR
UM-HUM
OH
OH
UH-HUH
OH
DECEMBER RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM
RIGHT
IF WE JUS-
HUH SO
UM YES I DO
WELL USUALLY IT WORKS OUT PRETTY WELL
UM I TRY TO PROJECT OUT UM RIGHT NOW I PROJECT OUT SIX MONTHS
YOU KNOW I HAVE MY FIXED MONTHLY BILLS AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE
AND UH I HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF MY SAVINGS THAT I ATTEMPT TO
TAKE OFF THE TOP
NOT UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING COME UP THAT'S UNUSUAL THAT I WAS UNEXPECTED AND THEN I MAY HAVE TO GO INTO SAVINGS
AND
KIND OF THE FORMULA I USE I USE UH NINETY PERCENT OF MY CHECK
AND THEN I RETAIN TEN PERCENT AND IF I DON'T USE IT THEN IT GOES INTO SAVINGS ALSO
WELL MY MONTHLY BILLS ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR HOUSE PAYMENTS THE SAME EVERY MONTH UH CAR PAYMENTS ARE THE SAME YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR INSURANCE IS DUE
SO YOU BUDGET ALL THAT IN THAT'S WHY A LOT OF TIMES I ONLY USE NINETY PERCENT OF MY SALARY BECAUSE SOME MONTHS I'LL HAVE INSURANCE
UM
TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR
AND I NEED THAT EXTRA MONEY AND TO TAKE IT OUT OF SAVINGS AT THAT POINT
SURE
UM-HUM A MONTH AT A TIME IS NOT A REALLY A BIG PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY FLEXIBILITY AS FAR AS UH UNFORESEEN SITUATIONS OR SOMETHING COMING DOWN THE ROAD THAT YOU KNOW IS COMING DOWN THE ROAD THAT YOU NEED TO SAVE FOR
YEAH I DO IT UH TWICE A YEAR AND UM YOU KNOW I COULD ADJUST IT EVERY MONTH THAT'S NO BIG DEAL
BUT UH I JUST FINISHED OUT DECEMBER AND UH WHEN I WAS DONE WITH IT I THREW IT AWAY AND I ALREADY HAD JANUARY THROUGH JULY MADE OUT
UM-HUM YEAH
I TAKE THE SAVINGS RIGHT OFF THE TOP I PAY MYSELF FIRST
I'M THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL THAT UH YOU KNOW I CAN'T
I HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING BACK FOR MYSELF TO FEEL LIKE I'M DOING MY JOB
IT'S MY MOTIVATOR
I SAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT
OUT OF WHAT OUT OF MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT NOT AS WELL AS THE JAPANESE DO
TWICE A MONTH UH UH ACTUALLY EVERY OTHER WEEK SO TWENTY SIX CHECKS
YEAH
SO TWICE A YEAR I PICK UP AN EXTRA CHECK ALSO
UH-HUH
HOW DO YOU ALL DO YOURS
UM-HUM
SPEND WHAT'S LEFT OVER HUH
UM-HUM
THERE'S REALLY NO CERTAIN FORMULA THAT YOU CAN SAY WELL I I WANNA SAY THIS MUCH AND I'M GONNA SPEND THIS MUCH FOR THE HOUSE AND
UH I'M KIND OF IN A SITUATION RIGHT NOW THAT MY OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN AND THEY'RE GONE SO UH
YOU KNOW AND THE HOUSE IS ALMOST PAID FOR SO WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE
UH WE'VE DONE THEM FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL
ONE THING WE DO ABOUT THE GROCERIES AND WH- AND WE JUST GOT BACK FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH WE SPEND AT THE GROCERY STORE BECAUSE WHEN WE COME HOME WE WRITE IT DOWN
SO IN A GIVEN MONTH
WE KNOW THAT WE SPENT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IT IS AND IF IT'S FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WE LOOK AT IT AND SAY WELL WHY DID WE SPEND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
AND WE SPENT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS MONTH BECAUSE OR LAST MONTH BECAUSE UH WE HAD SEVERAL CHRISTMAS PARTIES
SO BUT WE KNOW APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH OUR OUR MONTHLY GROCERY BILL IS YOU KNOW AND AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT TOO WITHIN
TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT OF WHAT UH WHAT YOU SPEND ONCE YOU GET A TRACK RECORD
WHICH BASEBALL TEAM'S YOUR FAVORITE
OH UH-HUH
OH HAVE THEY LIKE WHO ARE SOME OF THEIR WHO ARE SOME OF THEIR PLAYERS THAT THEY'VE TRADED AWAY
OH
UH-HUH
OH OH
OH SO THEY'VE HAD SOME REAL GOOD ONES OVER THE YEARS
UM-HUM
OH AH WELL THAT'S GOOD DO THEY IS IS BASEBALL FOR YOUNG KIDS THERE A BIG THING DO THEY START THEM OUT EARLY OR WHERE DO THEY GET ALL THESE GOOD PLAYERS FROM
OH OH
UM-HUM
OH
UM-HUM
HOW DO SO DO THEY HAVE A A PROGRAM AT ALL FOR YOUNG KIDS THERE FOR BASEBALL OR IS SOCCER THE BIGGEST THING OR
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT THAT SOCCER IS BIGGER IT USED TO BE AROUND HERE ANYWAY THAT UM BASEBALL WAS REAL BIG FOR THE YOUNG BOYS BUT NOW IT IT SOCCER IS
MAKING A REAL QUICK CATCH UP UM I KNOW THEY HAVE THE FOUR AND FIVE YEAR OLD KIDS START LIKE WITH THE TEE BALL
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT AT ALL
THE TEE BALL AND I THINK THEY GO UNTIL THEY'RE SEVEN THEN THEY HAVE THE PITCHING MACHINE I THINK EIGHT AND NINE AND THEN AND THEN JUST THE REGULAR PITCHING AFTER THAT BUT
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A BIG AS PROGRAM AS IT AS IT USED TO BE AND I'M I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR AROUND HERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY BASEBALL TEAMS I DON'T THINK THAT EVEN IN SALT LAKE CITY THERE IS A
THERE'S A
R- RIGHT SO IT IT'S NOT THERE'S NO TEAMS AROUND HERE THAT I REALLY FOLLOW AND AM CLOSE WITH HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED BASEBALL

OH
UH-HUH
OH
RIGHT
UH-HUH RIGHT WELL THAT'S I REMEMBER UH PLAYING BASEBALL WHEN I WAS JUST IN GRADE SCHOOL BUT BY THE TIME YOU KNOW WE GOT TO P E IT IT IT WASN'T A REAL
A REAL BIG THING EITHER BUT I ENJOY BASEBALL JUST FOR A FUN PASTIME NOW WITH YOU KNOW A GROUP GETS TOGETHER A FAMILY REUNION OR WHATEVER OR OR IT  WE WE LIVE IN A REAL SMALL COMMUNITY AND
THEY HAVE UH LIKE FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATIONS AND PEOPLE'LL GET TOGETHER AND PLAY SOFTBALL AND
THAT'S FUN I REALLY ENJOY THAT I THINK IT'S A FUN GAME I THINK IT'S FUNNER TO PLAY THAN TO WATCH MYSELF

UH JULIO FRANCO
YEAH AND THEY THEY TRADED AWAY UM INCAVIGLIA TO DETROIT I THINK AND THEN HE HIT MORE HOME RUNS THIS YEAR THAN HE'D EVER HIT BEFORE
UH NO WELL THEY GET THEM FROM YOU KNOW PUERTO RICO AND MEXICO AND THE MINOR LEAGUES
THE BASEBALL BASEBALL HAS A BIG MINOR LEAGUE SYSTEM
ESPECIALLY IN A A FEW PLAYERS COME OUT OF COLLEGE AND THEN UH MORE PLAYERS UM GO STRAIGHT TO THE MINORS
AND THAT GIVES THEM TIME TO SEE UH PITCHING AT A HIGHER SPEED YOU KNOW AN-
YEAH THEY DO IT'S IT'S MOSTLY IN THE SCHOOLS THE I THINK THE BIGGEST THING HERE IS SOCCER
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT YEAH
UM-HUM
NO THERE'S NOT CALIFORNIA'S THE NEAREST PLACE
YEAH
UH NO JUST IN P E UH IT'S IT'S PRETTY BIG HERE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD SEVERAL PLAYERS UM PICKED IN THE DRAFT YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE PICKED IN LOWER ROUNDS
ESPECIALLY PITCHERS
UH BUT MOSTLY THEY JUST GO ON TO COLLEGE BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY NEED THE EXPERIENCE AND THE EDUCATION SO
UM-HUM
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH I I UM I ENJOY PLAYING AND IT TOOK ALWAYS TOOK ME WE'D PLAY YOU KNOW DURING THE SPRING SEMESTER ALWAYS TOOK ME ABOUT SIX WEEKS BEFORE I COULD SEE THE BALL BEFORE I I COULD HIT THE BALL

THE THERE WERE SOME SPECTACULAR CATCHES AND A LOT OF HOME RUNS AND THEY HAD UH SEVERAL DOUBLE PLAYS YOU KNOW AND
UH NO IT WAS UH UH MINNESOTA TWINS VERSUS THE ATLANTA BRAVES
AND BOTH THE TEAMS WERE IN LAST PLACE AT ONE POINT IN THE SEASON
UM-HUM
THEN THEY FOUGHT THEIR WAY BACK UP TO THE TOP AND THEN OF COURSE MINNESOTA WON I THINK IN THE SEVENTH GAME AND ENDED UP
SO IT WAS REALLY EXCITING
RIGHT
AND IT LOOKED FOR A WHILE THAT LIKE ATLANTA WAS GOING TO THE WIN YOU KNOW BEFORE THEY WENT BACK TO MINNESO-  BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN YOU KNOW THEY PLAYED
UH CRIME IS OUR SUBJECT
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ACCUSED OF A CRIME

BUT THEY DON'T THEY HAVE AN EXTREMELY LOW RATE EXTREMELY LOW ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE UH THE DENSITY OF THE POPULATION AND STUFF UM THEY HAVE UH THEY HAVE THIS THIS SENSE OF OF FAMILY THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AND AND FAMILY HONOR
AND WHAT THEY DO THE THE MAIN PUNISHMENT THE MOST EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THEIR PUNISHMENT IS THAT THEY TAKE AND PUBLISH
THE OFFENDER'S NAME IN A NEWSPAPER THAT GETS SPREAD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY IN THE REGION THAT THEY'RE IN
IT WELL IT GIVES THE THE PERSON'S NAME AND THE FAMILY IS TYPICALLY SO EMBARRASSED
THAT THEY HAVE TO THEY SELL THEIR HOUSE THEY LEAVE THEY LEAVE THE REGION AND MOVE TO TO THE OPPOSITE END OF JA- OF JAPAN AND SO IT SHAMES THE ENTIRE FAMILY INCLUDING THE GRANDPARENTS AND AND MAYBE AUNTS AND UNCLES
UH-HUH

UH-HUH
YEAH WE- WELL YOU KNOW THE THI- I GUESS THE THING IS IS YOU KNOW WITH THE UH THE IN PART UH ONE OF THE THINGS TO BLAME IS THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE FAMILY IN GENERAL AND AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FAMILY AND AND AND THAT'S

RIGHT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM

UH-HUH
RIGHT
UM UM-HUM
YEAH AND IT'S SET INTO THE EARTH SO
UM-HUM
RIGHT UH-HUH
YEAH
OH GOSH I'M TRYING TO THINK WELL I GUESS OURS HAVE MOSTLY BEEN DOWN AT OUR LAKE HOUSE WE BUILT A H- BUILT A HOUSE DOWN ON CEDAR CREEK LAKE
SO
I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE WE'VE KIND OF LET THIS HOUSE GO
SO WE HAD A SHELL BUILT AND THEN WE DID EVERYTHING ELSE
SO IT WAS QUITE A BIT OF WORK
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
OH YEAH OURS IS NINETEEN YEARS OLD
UH-HUH
OH DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A RETAINING WALL OR
YEAH THAT MAKES THEM MORE DIFFICULT WE WE'VE JUST MY HUSBAND HAS JUST UM REPAI- REPAIRED OURS A LOT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT
BUT UH
ANYWAY WELL HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING ELSE
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH I YOU KNOW I'M WONDERING MYSELF NOW WHY I CHECKED THIS ONE BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS WHO DOES ALL THE THINGS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
I HAVEN'T
DONE THOSE THINGS AND OF COURSE
YOU KNOW INSIDE STUFF
BUT UM
NOW DOWN AT THE LAKE WE HAD TO LIKE PUT IN FLOORS AND PUT IN
WALL AND YOU KNOW DO THE PAINTING AND THE
UH CUT AND MAKE THE LIKE THE
UH WINDOW SILLS AND
THINGS AROUND THE DOOR AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF YOU KNOW SO WE WE DID QUITE A BIT
UH DOWN THERE THAT I HAD NEVER DONE OR WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT MUCH IN OUR OWN HOUSE
YEAH YEAH UH WE DO HA- STILL HAVE A PROBLEM DOWN THERE WE BUILT US A TWO STORY HOUSE AND THE BOTTOM STORY UH OH IT'S MORE LIKE A WALK OUT BASEMENT
AND W- IT WAS BUILT WITH THESE BLOCKS YOU KNOW THESE OLD GRAY BLOCKS I THINK THEY'RE CALLED HADITE BLOCKS
AND UH WE FOUND NOW WITH SOME AS MUCH RAIN AS WE'VE HAD THE PAST YEAR IT SEEPS THROUGH
THOSE BLOCKS AND COMES INTO THE DOWNSTAIRS
AND UH SO NOW WE HAVE BOUGHT SOME UH
UH
WATER PROOFING PAINT
AND THAT'S OUR NEXT PROJECT THE NEXT TIME WE GO DOWN THERE WE'VE GOT TO PAINT ALL THOSE BLOCK WALLS DOWNSTAIRS WITH THIS WATERPROOF PAINT AND THEN HOPE THAT MAYBE THAT WILL DO IT
BUT WHAT THEY SHOULD'VE DONE I THINK IS THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT PLASTIC OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAINST THE HOUSE BEFORE THEY PUT THE DIRT BACK YOU KNOW WHEN IT WAS BUILT
AND UH THEY DIDN'T DO THAT DIDN'T THINK THEY'D NEED TO
YEAH
OH HAVE YOU EVER USED THAT ANYWHERE
NOW PEOPLE UP NORTH THAT HAVE BASEMENTS I THINK
YOU AND DO YOU KNOW IF IT IF THEY'VE HAD GOOD LUCK WITH IT
WE HAD A HARD TIME EVEN FINDING IT DOWN HERE IN FACT YOU KNOW YOU GO IN A STORE AND THEY SAY OH WELL THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
AND THEN FINALLY WE FOUND SOME ONE SOMEWHERE THAT WAS FAMILIAR WITH IT PROBABLY LIVED IN THE NORTH
AND WELL THAT'S ENCOURAGING THEN BECAUSE I HAVEN'T KNOWN THAT MANY YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST NOT MANY BASEMENTS DOWN HERE ARE YOU FROM AROUND HERE
OH OKAY WELL WE'RE FROM YOU KNOW TEXAS TOO SO
UH BUT I WE HAVE A PARTNER IN THIS DEAL AND HE'S FROM THE NORTH SO HE WAS THE ONE THAT AND IT GAVE US A LOT MORE SPACE YOU KNOW IT GAVE US DOUBLE THE SPACE
AND TOWARD THE LAKE IT LOOKS LIKE A TWO STORY HOUSE YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT GRADUALLY THE BACK IT LOOKS LIKE A ONE STORY HOUSE YOU KNOW
UH-HUH BUILT KIND OF INTO A HILL A LITTLE HILL YOU KNOW
SO IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GIVE US A LOT MORE SPACE FOR THE MONEY
WE JUST UH HADN'T SOLVED OUR  WATER PROBLEM YET
BUT WE ALWAYS
OKAY
UH DO YOU COOK QUITE A BIT
THAT'S GOOD PRACTICE THOUGH
I KNOW WHEN I WAS SINGLE IT WAS UH I WOULDN'T COOK MUCH OF ANYTHING I THINK ONE NIGHT I SAUTEED A POUND OF MUSHROOMS AND THAT WAS DINNER
BUT UH WELL RIGHT NOW MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN UH UH SUBDIVISION THAT WE HAVE A DINNER CLUB THINGY
AND WHAT WE DO IS ONCE A MONTH WE'LL MEET AT ONE HOUSE AND THE HOST WILL PREPARE THE ENTREE AND PROVIDE THE DRINKS AND THEN EVERY ONE ELSE BRINGS SOMETHING
AND THEN IT ROTATES FROM MONTH TO MONTH YOU GET TOGETHER WITH FOUR COUPLES SO YOU ONLY HOST ONE TIME
IT IS REALLY NICE BUT UH
WELL
WE HAVEN'T BUT I THINK THAT'D BE GREAT YOU KNOW DO MEXICAN ONE TIME OR CHINESE THE NEXT TIME THINKING THE NEXT ONE WE GET INTO THAT I'LL DO THAT
BUT BASICALLY THE HOST SO FAR HAVE JUST BEEN PICKING YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AND THEN THEY'LL LET THE PEOPLE KNOW AND THEY'LL UH UH ASK PEOPLE TO BRING SOMETHING TO COMPLIMENT IT BUT PERSONALLY I LIKE TO PREPARE SOMETHING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE AHEAD OF TIME
BECAUSE I CAN'T TALK AND COOK AT THE SAME TIME UH IF I TRY YOU KNOW I- I LEAVE INGREDIENTS OUT  BUT UH
WE'RE SUPPOSE TO BE HOSTING NEXT TIME I'M THINKING OF ABOUT HAVING BEEF STROGANOFF BECAUSE I CAN DO THAT AHEAD OF TIME
AND
REALLY
N- NOW IS THIS ONE OF THE DISHES THAT YOU COOK
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE SO DON'T DON'T LET IT UH
WHAT DO YOU COOK WHEN YOU GO HOME

OH YOU SOUND LIKE MY HUSBAND HE'S A GARLIC FREAK TOO
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
DO YOU UH STIR FRY
DO YOU HAVE A WOK
PROBABLY WORKS JUST AS WELL
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO ALL THAT OFTEN AND EVERY TIME WE DO IT I THINK WHY DON'T WE COOK THIS WAY MORE OFTEN BECAUSE IT IS HEALTHY YOU GET A LOT OF VEGETABLES AND EVERYTHING

YEAH
O-  -KAY WELL I THINK THIS IS GOING TO PROBABLY BE THE MOST DIFFICULT TOPIC THAT I'VE DISCUSSED SO FAR YES WELL HAVE YOU RETURNED ANYTHING LATELY
UH-HUH WAS THIS SPIEGEL BY ANY CHANCE
DON'T KNOW  THAT ONE I KNOW SPIEGEL DOES THAT AND YES AND UH TO ME THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE TO THINK THAT
BUT WELL AND DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY HAD NO PROBLEM WITH RETURNING IT
OH WELL
UM-HUM
DID
DID YOU RETURN IT BECAUSE IT WAS DEFECTIVE OR BECAUSE YOU JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT
HUH
WELL I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BECAUSE A COUPLE YEARS AGO I REMEMBER I WAS IN ONE OF THE NICER DEPARTMENT STORES AND LOOKING AT IT WAS ONE OF THE DESIGNER T-SHIRTS OR SOME SORT OF THING LIKE THAT AND THE THING
IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW AS THEY ALWAYS ARE AND IT WAS A PIECE OF JUNK YOU KNOW STITCHING WAS TERRIBLE I THINK THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO JUST YOU KNOW PLAY ON A NAME
UM-HUM
NO WE DON'T I'VE BEEN TO ONE OF THE NORDSTROMS IN UM UH NEW YORK
NICE STORE
DO YOU REALLY
DO YOU HAVE LORD AND TAYLOR THERE
UM UH WE'RE ORIGINALLY FROM SAINT LOUIS AND WE CAME DOWN TO DALLAS AND THEY HAVE LORD AND TAYLORS HERE AND I LOOK AT A LOT OF THEIR HOUSE BRANDS AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF SOME OF THE HOUSE BRANDS IN SOME OF THE STORES
DOES NORDSTROMS CARRY THEIR OWN HOUSE BRAND
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
DO YOU SHOP BY MAIL QUITE A BIT
IT'S NOT AS INEX-
UM-HUM
THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I SEE BECAUSE UH MY SISTER GETS TONS OF CATALOGS AND PASSES THEM ON TO ME AND I LOOK AT THINGS AND THEY HAVE SOME GORGEOUS CLOTHES BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GO BY SIZES YOU KNOW YOU'LL GO TO A DEPARTMENT STORE AND TRY ON THREE DIFFERENT SIZES IN THREE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS AND THEY ALL FIT YOU KNOW DIFFERENTLY BUT UH THAT'S THE MAIN THING IS THAT I CAN'T TELL
WHETHER THE THING IS GOING TO FIT OR NOT
AND SO I TEND NOT TO MAIL ORDER
BUT
I-
WELL PERSONALLY I ALWAYS TRY ON BEFORE I BUY ANYWAY I JUST IT AMAZES ME WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT THEY BUY LIKE THEY BUY A BUNCH OF CLOTHES AND THEY DON'T TRY ANYTHING ON THEY TAKE THEM HOME
OH OKAY WELL THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY RIGHT
I HEAR ABOUT THAT TOO AND THAT JUST APPALLS ME I MEAN THAT'S STEALING REALLY
REALLY
YOU KNOW I JUST DID LAST WEEK AS A MATTER OF FACT UM I'M WONDERING IF THEIR SUBJECT IS MORE UH PRODUCTS BY MAIL OR THINGS THAT YOU BUY AT THE STORE BUT UM
I BOUGHT SOMETHING THROUGH THE MAIL THROUGH A MERCHANT THROUGH A COMPANY THAT'S GENERALLY GOT PRETTY GOOD PRODUCTS AND
I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY THEY HANDLED THE RETURN POLICY THEY SENT UPS TO OUR DOOR TO PICK IT UP FREE OF CHARGE  WHICH IS SUCH A AN UNUSUAL ALWAYS HAVE TO GO TO THE
POST OFFICE OR SOME PLACE TO RETURN IT USUALLY
IT WAS HANNAH ANDERSON THE CHILDREN'S UM CLOTHING
DO THEY
IT REALLY IS
IT TOOK A WHILE BECAUSE IT WAS THE HOLIDAY WEEKS UM
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHEN THE PERSON WAS GOING TO ARRIVE WE'RE WE'RE FORTUNATE IN THAT MY HUSBAND WORKS MOST OF THE TIME OUT OF OUR HOME SO HE WAS HERE BUT
IT WOULD'VE PROBABLY BEEN AN INCONVENIENCE IF IF IT HAD BEEN A HOME PICKUP AND AND WE HADN'T BEEN HERE BUT THEY WERE ALSO WILLING TO PICK UP AT WORK
IT WAS DEFECTIVE WE RETURNED IT FOR THE SAME THING UM IN A LITTLE LARGER SIZE BUT IT SEEMED THAT IT WAS STITCHED UH AROUND THE COLLAR SUCH THAT THE SECOND TIME SHE WORE IT IT UH IT RIPPED
AND AND I THINK THAT'S UNUSUAL FOR THAT COMPANY BECAUSE THEY DO USUALLY HAVE PRETTY GOOD PRODUCTS BUT TO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WE WERE POSED ABOUT WHETHER THINGS TEND TO BE POOR QUALITY I THINK DEFINITELY I THINK A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT UM
ARE NOT NECESSARILY LOW PRICE TEND TO BE MANUFACTURED IN A LOT OF CASES AS IF THEY WERE LOWER PRICED
UM-HUM
YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH AND IT IT'S UNFORTUNATE YOU REALLY CANNOT DEPEND ON THE THE DEPARTMENT STORE'S NAME FOR THAT NECESSARILY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE NORDSTROMS IN DALLAS
UM-HUM
THEY ARE REALLY NICE STORES AND I THINK I ASSUMED IN THE BEGINNING THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY CA- CARRY OVERALL PRETTY GOOD MERCHANDISE YOU YOU HAVE TO BE JUST AS CAREFUL THERE AS YOU DO AT ANY OTHER LOWER PRICED STORE
YEAH SURPRISINGLY
NO
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT I BET THEY PROBABLY DO BUT I I'M NOT SURE THAT I'VE
ASSOCIATED SOME OF WHAT I'VE SEEN AS LINES THAT THEY ALWAYS CARRY AS THEIR OWN BRAND OR JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE UM GOTTEN AT A AT A LOWER UH PRICE BECAUSE IT'S A LARGE VOLUME SOME OF THEIR CHILDREN'S LINES
I TEND TO LOOK THERE FOR KIDS' THINGS BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY THEY SOMETIMES HAVE THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T FIND ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRETTY LARGE VARIETY BUT NOT OFTEN FOR MYSELF
NOT THAT MUCH ACTUALLY I  USED TO I THINK BEFORE I HAD A CHILD AND BECAUSE YOU END UP PAYING FOR THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING AND EVERYTHING UM
AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE CONVENIENCE OF RETURNING IT IF IT'S NOT RIGHT UH I- I TEND LESS OFTEN TO DO THAT TODAY THAN I MIGHT'VE TEN YEARS AGO
UM-HUM
EXACTLY
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WHEREAS YOU MIGHT TAKE A CHANCE IN A STORE AND BRING IT HOME AND CONSIDER IT YOU
YOU FIND THAT IT'S A LOT MORE INCONVENIENT TO HAVE TO ARRANGE FOR RETURNING IT IF IT'S BY MAIL
OH REALLY NO I MEANT EVEN IF YOU'VE TRIED IT ON I I'M THINKING ABOUT SOME CLOTHES BUYING FOR KIDS OR YOUR HUSBAND OR SOMETHING IT
YEAH IT IS FUNNY YOU KNOW I'M ALSO AMAZED AT UH
THAT I READ ABOUT THOSE I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO DOES THIS BUT THAT PEOPLE BUY CLOTHES AND WEAR THEM AND THEN THINK THAT THEY CAN RETURN THEM
THAT'S WHAT
ARE YOU THERE OKAY NOW TELL ME YOUR FAVORITE TEAM
YES
OKAY I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT LATE IN THE SEASON FOR THEM TO ASSIGN US WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'RE HEADED
SO WE'LL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE WITH THE RANGERS
WHAT ARE YOUR THINKINGS ON WHAT THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO
WELL I HEARD TONIGHT ON THE NEWS THAT HE IS WILLING TO COME DOWN ON HIS
YES AND THE RANGERS GO UP A LITTLE BIT UM-HUM
I THINK THE ENTIRE BASEBALL YEAH THEY'RE THE ONES THAT PROBABLY ARE PAYING THE HIGHEST
AND I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS
NO
THAT'S RIGHT
WHAT I SAW ON THE NEWS TODAY THAT BUE- BUECHELE WAS BACK JUST TO VISIT
I'M AWFUL SORRY HE'S NOT STILL
OH I'M SURE IT WAS
PITTSBURGH YEAH
YES SIR
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HOWSE
WHO IS THE COACH FOR THE PITCHERS
YES
HIS ASSISTANT
UM-HUM
I REALLY WISH THEY COULD
SEE FIT TO GET RID OF HOWSE
NO NO I REALLY DON'T
AND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND UP YOU KNOW ON MY SOAPBOX AND SAY THAT BUT I'M NOT FOND OF HOWSE AND I'M NOT FOND OF GRIEVES
YEAH
WELL I'M JUST GULLIBLE ENOUGH THAT I THINK BOBBY VALENTINE IS UM UH DOING ALL RIGHT
AND I'M SURE WELL
OH I KNOW I KNOW SO BUT I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH
FOR THESE RANGERS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND GIVE UM
OH UH NOLAN RYAN THE SUPPORT HE NEEDS
I UNDERSTAND
WELL
UM-HUM
UH BASEBALL
WELL I'VE BEEN KIND OF  BEEN INTRIGUED WITH THE RANGERS
UH
MORE SO WITH UH
UH THEIR MANAGEMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'D I DON'T FOLLOW BASEBALL THAT THAT CLOSELY
BUT UH SI- YOU KNOW SINCE I LIVE HERE SO CLOSE TO ARLINGTON UH
THAT'S THE TEAM THAT I'VE BEEN KIND OF FOLLOWING
UM-HUM
RIGHT
WELL I THINK THAT UH
YOU KNOW WITH UH
SO MUCH CONTROVERSY OVER RUBEN SIERRA NOT SIGNING AND ASKING US FOR SO MUCH MONEY IT'S UM
YOU KNOW I THINK
I'M NOT REAL SURE ABOUT TH- DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RUBEN SIERRA'S UH
YEAH THAT HE WAS WILLING TO COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND UH IF THE RANGERS WILL GO UP A LITTLE BIT
YEAH BUT A LITTLE BIT FROM THREE YOU KNOW FROM THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OR THIRTY FIVE MILL- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
YEAH THEY ARE
UM-HUM AND I REALLY THINK I REALLY THINK THAT UH THAT THEY OUGHT TO
I'M NOT REAL SURE THAT THEY SHOULD PAY HIM THAT MUCH MONEY I THINK THEY SHOULD UH
UH PAY HIM WHAT HIS SALARY'S GOING TO BE
UH AND LET HIM BECAUSE HE'S GOT ONE MORE YEAR BEFORE HE TURNS INTO A A FREE AGENT
AND THEN UH WHO KNOWS IF HE PRODUCES NEXT YEAR THEY MAY HAVE TO END UP PAYING HIM ANYWAY
BUT IF HE DOESN'T THEN HIS MARKET VALUE WILL GO DOWN AND THEY CAN PICK HIM UP FOR FOR A LOT LESS THAN THAN THEY WOULD UH IF THEY PAID HIM THE SI- YOU KNOW THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THIS YEAR
UH-HUH
OH YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE THAT WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR HIM
YEAH IT WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR HIM AND AND UH HE JUST SIGNED ON UH I THINK IT WAS LIKE A FIVE YEAR DEAL WITH UH
PITTSBURGH SO YOU KNOW HE'S REAL HAPPY THERE AS FAR AS THE RANGERS ARE CONCERNED I THINK
I THINK THEY NEED SOME DEFINITELY NEED SOME PITCHING
UH
AND SO I YOU KNOW I
UM THE PITCHING COACH
WELL YOU KNOW I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE NEWS TONIGHT AND THEY SHOWED A A A BLACK GUY THAT WAS GO- WAS HELPING OUT UH
HIS ASSISTANT AND I THINK THAT'S A A GREAT ADDITION I MEAN HE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND AND UH
OH YOU DON'T LIKE HOWSE HUH
OH TOM GRIEVE
YEAH I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT UM THAT THEY'RE READY TO GET RID OF OF UH TOM GRIEVE YET
BUT HOWSE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT UH SITUATION AND I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT THAT THEY
THAT THEY NEED SOME YOU KNOW SOME CHANGES IN UH PITCHING COACH MAYBE AND
UM
YOU DO HUH
OH I KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S TOO BAD THAT UH IT HAS TO BE A FORTY TWO YEAR OLD GUY TO TO LEAD THE UH THE RANGERS YOU KNOW
THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME SOME YOUNG GUYS THAT CAN TAKE THE LEAD AND
AND UH
YEAH
-O OKAY SO YOU WERE WITH TI HUH
WELL ANY STAY ANY PLACE THAT LONG THEY GOT TO BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT RIGHT
I UH WORK FOR MYSELF I SELL UH METAL FABRICATING EQUIPMENT AND TOOLING AND UH UH
OH CAD CAM SYSTEMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND UH CONSEQUENTLY I CAN'T REALLY DISCUSS BIG TIME BENEFITS AT THE MOMENT ALTHOUGH I HAD WORKED FOR UNIVAC AND PITNEY BOWES AND SOME BIG COMPANIES ONCE UPON A TIME
AND UH I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY REALIZE THE COST OF THEM AND THEY'RE SOMEWHAT PROBABLY GETTING OUT OF HAND
WELL
I THINK UH
OH THE WAY I GO-
RIGHT WELL NO IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY SAY OTHER THAN SALARY BUT WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER TO BE KIND OF IMPORTANT I GUESS
SUCH AS
WELL I I IMAGINE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO YOU KNOW LIKE UH YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND PENSIONS AND ALL THAT KIND OF GOOD STUFF UH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEYS THAT MOST PEOPLE UH PROBABLY PUT ABOVE BENEFITS THAT'S WHY I WORK FOR MYSELF BASICALLY TOO I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANNA DO
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL I THINK AS LONG AS IT'S COMPARABLE WITH YOU KNOW THE JOB OR CAN
THAT UH YOU AREN'T BEING  PICKED ON IN THE SENSE OF BEING THE WHIPPING BOY DOLLAR WISE IN THE CORPORATION YOU YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO I
YES YES
WE-
RIGHT
WELL I I WOULDN'T SAY THEY AREN'T MOTIVATED BY MONEY BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE
EQUAL OR GREATER IMPORTANT I I GUESS IF YOU MAKE ENOUGH MONEY UH IF THE MONEY WERE REALLY BIG BUCKS I GUESS SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS YOU COULD UH
LIVE WITH FOR A WHILE ANYWAY UNTIL YOU HAD ENOUGH TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO BUT
YES
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH UH WHERE DO YOU WORK
OH
YEAH THEY UH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE CATEGORY'S SUPPOSED TO BE UH BUT IT WAS WHAT
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT BENEFITS WOULD YOU CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN YOU UH GO TO WORK FOR A LARGE COMPANY
UH
OTHER OTHER THAN SALARY DIDN'T IT SAY YEAH
WELL I'M I THOUGHT IT SAID OTHER THAN SALARY BUT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I UH PERSONALLY I LEFT MY PREVIOUS JOB WHICH WAS WITH CHANCE-VOUGHT BEFORE I JOINED UH
THERE AND IRONICALLY I LEFT CHANCE-VOUGHT THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN DALLAS COUNTY AT THAT TIME WITH SOME
THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AS I RECALL AND UH JOINED A LITTLE FIRM OF TEXAS INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO WITH A SMALL COMPANY
AND UH THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHEN I JOINED AND UH
THEN IT BECAME DALLAS COUNTY'S LARGEST EMPLOYER OH
BUT UH ONE REASON I LEFT WHERE I WAS IT DEFINITELY HAD TO DO WITH WHAT I WANTED UH  BESIDES WHAT I WAS GETTING AND IT HAD TO DO WITH UH
WANTING TO DO RESEARCH AND IN OTHER WORDS I WANTED TO ENJOY THE JOB AND HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DO THE JOB
YEAH
WELL I PARTICIPATED ON MANY UH SURVEYS AND THAT SORT OF THING I WAS A TI FELLOW SO I WAS DOWN ON YOU KNOW ON THE TECHNICAL LADDER SIDE RATHER THAN THE UH
HEAVY MANAGEMENT ALTHOUGH I WAS A BRANCH MANAGER AT ONE TIME
AND  IT'S AMAZING THAT MANAGERS IN GENERAL JUST WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE SURVEY RESULTS BECAUSE TO THEM
UH MONEY IS THE MOTIVATION AND UH BENEFITS YOU KNOW STOCK OPTIONS UH PERKS THAT SORT OF THING
AND POWER AND THEY THEY JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WITH THE TECHNICAL SURVEYS THAT WERE DONE BY THE UH INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND UH OTHERS
UH INCLUDING IBM'S THAT IN THE TECHNICAL COMMUNITY SALARY WAS NEVER FIRST  YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO USUALLY WERE UH NUMBER ONE WAS USUALLY UH ENJOYABLE WORK OR WORK THAT I ENJOY SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
UH AND NUMBER TWO WAS FREEDOM TO DO THAT WORK NORMALLY AND UH THIRD OR EVEN FOURTH SOMETIMES WAS THE SALARY
AND THAT WAS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY TECHNICAL UH LADDER SURVEY THAT WAS TAKEN OVER THE
OH FIFTEEN OR SO YEARS THAT I PARTICIPATED BUT INVARIABLY THE MANAGERS WOULD CHALLENGE THIS YOU KNOW BECAU- BECAUSE THEY JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T MOTIVATED BY MONEY
YEAH WELL I'M SURE YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE BEING PAID A SLAVE LABOR SCALE OBVIOUSLY MONEY WOULD BE HIGH UP ON THE LIST BUT
IN A COMPETITIVE UH MARKET AS IT WAS MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I WAS IN WHERE YOU COULD G- YOU COULD GET A JOB ELSEWHERE ANYT- ANY DAY OF THE WEEK YOU WANTED TO GO UNTIL ABOUT THE LAST TWO YEARS AND UH
THINK OF THE JOB BENEFITS YOU HAVE
THE DENTAL INSURANCE
UM DO YOU WORK FOR TI
OKAY HUM
UM-HUM
HUM
YEAH
UH-HUH
HM THAT DOES SOUND PRETTY BOGUS
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
HM
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF STRANGE
WHO'S YOU- WHO'S YOUR DENTAL CARE THROUGH
UH-HUH
UM
OURS IS THROUGH UH CIGNA
AND IT'S NOT TOO BAD I MEAN I HAVEN'T
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE DENTIST A WHOLE LOT EXCEPT FOR LIKE JUST REGULAR VISITS

UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S GOOD IF NOTHING ELSE THEY'VE GOT THE GANGS PUSHED DOWN TO WHERE THEY'RE  YOU KNOW NOT GOING TO BE VERY ACTIVE AT LEAST AS FAR AS YOU KNOW MURDERS OR OPEN CRIMES ARE CONCERNED
YEAH THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH TYPE PROGRAMS  YOU KNOW THE ONLY TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
AND WHEN THEY START DOING SOMETHING POSITIVE WITH FAMILIES FAMILIES HAVE GONE IN THE TOILET IN THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS
THEY SEEM TO BE FIGHTING AGAINST FAMILY
YEAH
AND AND AND THAT'S OKAY TO SAY SO AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GOT TO FORGIVE
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DOING IT ON PURPOSE USUALLY VERY SELDOM ARE THEY DOING IT ON PURPOSE
YEAH
I HAD SOME MODICUM AT LEAST OF ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT
YEAH WELL THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS WITH US WE HAD I HAD A PRETTY GOOD FAMILY LIFE BY COM- I HAD AN EXCELLENT FAMILY LIFE BY COMPARISON TO A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN PERFECT BUT  THEY DID WHAT THEY KNEW HOW TO DO AND THEY DID IT THE BEST THEY KNEW HOW SO
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN CONSIDERING THE CONSCIOUS IT SEEMS TO GO  I MEAN
WHAT KIND OF CRIMES YOU HAVE IN HATTIESBURG
OH BOY THAT'S AND HATTIESBURG'S NOT THAT BIG IS IT FIFTY THOUSAND OR SO YEAH
WELL

YEAH
AND IT BOY IT JUST UPSETS US WHEN PEOPLE GET OFF WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING THEY'RE THEY'RE ON THEY'RE OUT ON PRO- PROBATION IN FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER MURDERING HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE AND
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
YES
YEAH
AND JUST  GANG RELATED MURDER THIS PAST YEAR
YEAH
ACTUAL PEOPLE IN NEIGHBORHOODS INVOLVED
YEAH
YEAH UH
UH EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE GOT IS BLAMED ON YOUR PARENTS
AND THAT TO ME THAT'S JUST DEFEATING THE FAMILY RIGHT THERE
I MEAN IF YOU CAN
YEAH
YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW OUT OF MY OWN FAMILY I-  I WAS CLOTHED AND SHELTERED AND EDUCATED AND
I HAVEN'T BLAMED ANY OF MY FUTURE PROBLEMS ON ON ON THE FAMILY UPBRINGING OR WHATEVER
YEAH
I LIKE I CAN'T EVER IMAGINE MY SON COMMITTING A CRIME
AND I THINK HE KNOWS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT NOT IN IN HIS WORLD BUT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT  DO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES AND AND SMALL CRIMES AND THINK NOTHING OF IT IT'S
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
SO LAWYERS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT'S A BIG CONTRIBUTOR I THINK WOMEN HAVE UH REALLY
UM BEGUN TO PENETRATE A LOT OF FIELDS THAT WERE DOMINATED BY MEN FOR CENTURIES
OH YEAH
UH-HUH WELL I THINK UM
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAS BEEN THE UH PENETRATION OF A LOT OF THESE FIELDS BY WOMEN AND  I THINK
IT'S GONNA CONTINUE UH AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT NOW FOR
SOME MEN AND AND A LOT OF WOMEN I THINK UH
IT'S GONNA BRING VERY GOOD THINGS AND UH WE'RE GOING TO BE A LOT BETTER OFF AS A SOCIETY AS IT CONTINUES BUT IT'S A PAINFUL TRANSITION
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF ATTITUDES THAT HAVE TO CHANGE AND I GUESS THAT'S THE BIG THING
YOU KNOW AS PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDES THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE WOMEN UH PARTICIPATING AS EQUAL PARTNERS
IN OUR SOCIETY IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN AND HISTORY WILL RECORD THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA AND UH
NO I I'M NOT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE ANITA HILL TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE AND
UH NOW I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THAT AT ALL WE HAVE UH WE HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD MY WIFE UH WORKS OUT OF THE HOME UM AND UH
UH I THINK JUST LOOKING AT HOW UH HER UH VIEWS DIFFER FROM THOSE OF HER MOTHER A GENERATION BEFORE
SO IT'S IT IT'S REALLY CHANGING ATTITUDES AND UM THE ECONOMIC NECESSITY AND THE POLITICAL CHANGES AS YOU POINTED OUT ARE GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE I THINK
UM IT'S A PAINFUL TRANSITION BUT A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BIG STEP FOR HUMANKIND AND I THINK UH IT'S IT'S REAL PROGRESS BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH ATTITUDES THAT HAVE TO CHANGE AND I- I GUESS IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY I'D SAY
THAT OVERALL IT'S JUST THE ATTITUDE OF MEN AND WOMEN TOWARD EQUAL PARTICIPATION AND EQUAL PAY AND EQUAL POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS FOR WOMEN BECAUSE
THAT'S REALLY GONNA BE BETTER FOR EVERYBODY BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THREATENED BY THAT AS IS REFLECTED IN WHAT GOES ON
YEAH I
WELL I THINK I THINK BOTH
YEAH BOTH ATTITUDES HAVE TO CHANGE AND I THINK UH
UM IT'S IT'S E- EVIDENT TO ME AS I LOOK AT ALL THE TELEVISION SHOWS THAT NOW FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN UH WATCHING ROSEANNE LAST NIGHT WATCHING
UH THE SHOW THAT PRECEDED IT HOME IMPROVEMENTS ALL THESE TELEVISION SHOWS WHICH REACH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO REFLECT NEW ATTITUDES AND THOSE
WELL AND NOT ONLY I MEAN  THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WOMEN HAVE HAVE CARRIED MORE THAN THEIR WEIGHT AND ARE STILL DOING THAT AND
UM I SEE I THINK THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR MEN AS WELL AS A GUY I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S UH IT'S MEN WHO'VE SUFFERED FROM THIS TOO BECAUSE MEN NEED TO L- TO LEARN
UH MAINLY THE FACT THAT THEY LET WOMEN IN LAW NOW
I THINK THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE WAY PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT WOMEN
NOT JUST LAWYERS BUT POLICE OFFICERS AND JUDGES AND
THE WHOLE LEGAL PROFESSION IN GENERAL
BECAUSE IT USED TO BE STRICTLY MALE AND THE VIEWS ON IT USED TO BE STRICTLY MALE
AND NOW THERE'S WOMEN IN IT AND I THINK THAT AFFECTED A LOT OF THINGS
OH I CAN I CAN DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THAT I'M I'M IN A FIELD THAT MOST PEOPLE SAY IS STRICTLY MALE
YEAH MECHANICS
OH YEAH VERY PAINFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE CERTAIN WOMEN THAT TAKE VERY DIM VIEWS ON MOTHERS THAT ACTUALLY WORK
I'M A MOTHER OF TWO AND I STILL HOLD DOWN A JOB AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU'RE NOT HOME WITH YOUR KIDS ALL THE TIME YOUR KIDS ARE GONNA TURN OUT BAD I DON'T THINK SO
SOME MEN BUT YOU'D BELIEVE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY WOMEN ARE AGAINST IT
YEAH
UM-HUM
OH YEAH AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST STEPS
WE OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN GENERAL COULD TAKE
YEAH
YEP
YEAH THAT'S FOR SURE AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THE MEN ARE THE ONES THAT ARE FIGHTING THIS
BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST WOMEN GOING INTO THE WORK FORCE DOING YOU KNOW EVEN JOBS YOU KNOW ON AN EVEN KEEL WITH MEN
A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE THE WOMEN THAT ARE FIGHTING IT AND MOST PEOPLE SAY WELL MEN TRY AND KEEP WOMEN LOCKED UP THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE
I MEAN THE WOMEN HAVE THESE IDEAS THAT THEY GOT TO BE THE LITTLE HOME MAKERS AND THEY HAVE TO STAY AT HOME OR THEY'RE NOT DOING GOOD YOU KNOW A GOOD JOB
AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO BUT EVERYBODY'S BLAMING IT ON THE GUYS SAYING WELL THE GUYS DON'T LET THE WOMEN OUT
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO IT'S JUST THE WOMEN HAVE TO REALIZE THEY CAN DO BOTH
YEP AND THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT AND WORKING AND ALSO KEEPING THE HOME TOGETHER
IN DOLLARS AND LIVES AND THE LONG TERM EFFECTS
YOU READY I I'LL HIT IT IF YOU'RE READY TO START OKAY
MY NAME'S KAREN BY THE WAY WHAT WHAT'S YOUR NAME
SAN FRANCISCO
OH NICE TO MEET YOU
READY TO GO
WHAT WOULD THAT HOW WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF IT HAD BEEN FOUGHT LIKE A WAR
YOU YOU THINK IT WAS A WINNABLE WAR THEN
UH-HUH
YOU MEAN THE EFFECTS OF OF OF VIETNAM BEING TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO TO BE MORE DEFENSIVE IN HIS POSTURE AND GO FOR
I MEANT OFFENSIVE I'M SORRY UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM
I DO THINK ONE OF THE EFFECTS WAS THAT THE UH PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT KIND OF AN UM ACTIVITY WERE SURPRISED AT THE POWER THAT THE MEDIA HAD ON UM INTERVENING AND PROBABLY
SET THE TONE FOR MEDIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN FUTURE WHETHER IT WAS A WAR ACTIVITY OR
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT ARE GOING TO INVOLVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
EVERYTHING CHANGED AFTER THAT IN TERMS OF MEDIA
UH-HUH
WELL YOU REMEMBER IN THE GULF WAR THEY MADE A SPECIFIC EFFORT NOT TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES THAT THE MEDIA THEY FELT THE MEDIA MADE IN
VIETNAM WAR THEY WEREN'T ABOUT TO HAVE PEOPLE OUT IN THERE REPORTING
UH-HUH
UM
UH-HUH
THAT APPROACH PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SHORTENED THE TIME THAT WE WERE OVER THERE TOO AT LEAST
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH
WELL UH
OH I'M READY YEAH SURE
KAREN MY NAME'S JOHN BENYAK WHERE DO YOU LIVE
OH I LIVE IN DALLAS
JUST OUTSIDE OF DALLAS
NICE TALKING TO YOU
WHAT'S THAT MEAN WE'RE READY TO GO
OKAY WELL IT UH THE WAY IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T WORTH ANYTHING REALLY I JUST DON'T THINK I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT UH
IT JUST WASN'T CARRIED ON THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT WASN'T CARRIED ON LIKE A WAR I MEAN IF WE WERE IN THERE TO FIGHT A WAR REGARDLESS OF THE REASON WE WERE THERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOUGHT LIKE A WAR IT JUST UH
WE
WELL I THINK WE'D UH WE'D UH BEAT THEM I DON'T THINK UH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TWENTY YEARS LATER DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE COUNTRY WITHIN AND WITH US BUT UH I THINK IF WE'D UH HAD ALLOWED THE MILITARY PEOPLE TO CONDUCT IT LIKE A WAR
INSTEAD OF LETTING THE POLITICIANS AND THE
AND THE PEACE  AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT DICTATE THE TERMS OF THE WAY WE FOUGHT I THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT A LOT DIFFERENTLY
OH YES YEAH I MEAN IT WAS JUST A TWO BIT COUNTRY ALWAYS WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE AND UH OR AT LEAST IT IS NOW AND THERE'S NO WAY
THAT IF WE'D UH BEEN ABLE TO TAKE UH
USE THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAD THE POTENTIAL WE HAD TO FIGHT A WAR AGAINST A COUNTRY LIKE THAT WE WOULD HAVE UH WHAT WOULD HAVE LOST IT AS A WAR UH THE LONG TERM EFFECTS WELL
I UH I DON'T KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE TOUGHER TO ANSWER I THINK UH
DEPENDS I GUESS ON WHO'S IN OFFICE BUT UH I THINK BUSH USED THAT UH LAST YEAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF UH BY TAKING SOME STRONGER STRONGER MEASURES AND WHEN THE WAR STARTED
BE MORE OR BE MORE OFFENSIVE WELL ONCE THE WAR STARTED ONCE THEY DEC-
ONCE THEY DECIDED TO FIGHT THE THING WE TAKE A TAKE A MUCH UH
RUN IN THERE AND DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN LET THE THING DRAG ON I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN VIETNAM IS THAT UH THEY WE ESCALATED AND UH JUST YOU KNOW ON A GRADUAL BASIS AND GAVE THE
UM NORTH VIETNAMESE AND VIET CONG TIME TO ADJUST TO OUR UH
INCREASES IN UH PERSONNEL AND SO FORTH THEY JUST DIDN'T GO IN THERE IF THEY'D A SENT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS IN THERE AT ONE TIME INITIALLY UH I THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENTLY BUT DIFFERENT BUT IT UH THEY WENT FROM
HAVING THE ADVISORS UH UP TO THAT FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME A LONG A LONG NUMBER OF YEARS AND AS I SAID I THINK THE UH
THE ENEMY JUST GRADUALLY ADJUSTED TO THAT AND
THEY DIDN'T UH THE PEOPLE THE COUNTRY THE PEOPLE HERE DIDN'T WANT THE WAR THE WAY IT TURNED OUT THEY DIDN'T WANT IT THAT'S
UH-HUH
RIGHT
OH REALLY
RIGHT WELL THERE ARE
YEAH THERE WERE EVERY EVERY NIGHT YOU'D COME HOME FROM WORK AND UH OR SCHOOL OR WHATEVER AND SEE IT ON THE UH THE NEWS I
IMAGINE THAT WASN'T THE CASE DURING WORLD WAR TWO OR ANY OF THE OTHER WARS UH PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAD THE INVOLVEMENT IN IT AND THERE WERE A LOT OF
A LOT OF
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT YEAH BUT UH I JUST UH
I I GUESS I WAS IN MY LET'S SEE
MY TWENTIES DURING DURING MOST OF THAT WAR AND I I NEVER DID THINK THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE DOING IT RIGHT I I'M JUST NOT A UH A FAN OF JANE FONDA AND PEOPLE LIKE HER I MEAN THAT SHE'D GO AROUND SPEAKING ON DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND
GETTING PEOPLE UH AROUSED ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND OF COURSE UH THEY ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE VOCAL MINORITY AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT WAS THE SOLID MAJORITY AND THE VOCAL MINORITY AND
PEOPLE WERE LISTENING TO TO HER AND I GUESS POLITICIANS WERE TOO BUT I JUST FELT
I WAS IN THE SERVICE AT THAT TIME I WASN'T OVER THERE BUT I JUST FELT THAT THEY FOUGHT THE THING I MEAN THEY JUST DIDN'T FIGHT IT LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE AND IT'S A WAR WHETHER A WAR IS RIGHT OR WRONG YOU I MEAN IF YOU'RE OVER THERE AND
PEOPLE OR YOUNG PEOPLE MEN OR WOMEN ARE DYING THEY OUGHT TO FIGHT IT AS A WAR AND
EITHER WIN OR LOSE BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT'S A WAR AND NOT JUST UH UH MEALY MOUTH THEIR THEIR WAY THROUGH THE THING AND TRY TO GET THE UM OTHER SIDE TO GIVE UP ON THE BASIS OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WE HAD IN TERMS OF POWER AND SO FORTH
OH YEAH IT WOULD SURE SHORTEN THE TIME AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AND SO FORTH WE MIGHT HAVE LO- I I I JUST DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE LOST THE THE
ALL RIGHT I GUESS THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO TALK ABOUT FITNESS WITH EVERYBODY AND THEIR NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS AND GOING OUT AND GETTING THEIR RECOR REGULAR EXERCISE PROGRAM UM DO YOU RECOR EXERCISE REGULARLY
AND TELL ME ABOUT THAT IF YOU WOULD
UH-HUH
YES
WOW
WELL THAT'S GREAT THAT'S FANTASTIC DO YOU HAVE THAT SET UP WHERE YOU CAN UH LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC OR READ A BOOK OR YOU JUST UH GO
WELL GOOD  SO YOU'RE GOO- YOU'RE USING IT
YES  BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT ON A STATIONARY BIKE
YEAH
OH
OKAY
UM-HUM
YES YES
WELL YOU'VE GOT ME AT A DISADVANTAGE I DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR REGIMENT I DO EXERCISE PERIODICALLY BUT IT'S
WHENEVER I HAVE THE TIME I UH I HAVE A PROBLEM IN THAT I DON'T MAKE THE TIME AND I I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND IN FACT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE I WAS
ON ALL SORTS OF ATHLETIC TEAMS AND AND REGULAR PROGRAMS BUT SINCE I'VE GOTTEN INTO A NEW JOB AND INTO MY UH CAREER
AND INTO A YOUNG FAMILY TIME SEEMS TO ESCAPE ME RIGHT NOW BUT UH ONE THING THAT I REALLY ENJOY
IS THAT UH I HAVE BICYCLES AND I HAVE TWO OLDER BOYS THAT THEY LIKE TO RIDE BICYCLES WITH ME AND WE RIDE AS A FAMILY
AND YOU KNOW UH I ACTUALLY LIVE IN PLANO BUT I'M WORKING HERE IN DALLAS AND THEY HAVE SOME EXCELLENT BIKE PATHS
WHERE YOU CAN GO AND RIDE FOR MILES AND MILES AND DAYS AND DAYS AND NOT SEE THE SAME SCENERY TWICE WHICH IS REALLY FUN
AND UH ONE THING THAT I'VE BEEN DOING ALSO IS THAT
MIND YOU IT'S NOT REGULARLY BUT UH I LIKE TO GO OUT AND GO JOGGING AND I DO THAT AND THE BOYS GET ON THEIR BIKES AND UH WE WE
THEY RIDE ALONG AND I JOG ALONG AND IT'S A NICE TIME TO SPEND SOME SOME TIME WITH THE BOYS TOO SO I'M TRYING TO COORDINATE
YOU KNOW MY FAMILY TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY EXERCISE TIME EXERCISE PROGRAM AND UH WE REALLY SEEM TO ENJOY THAT
AND UH THERE THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT IS MY BOYS ARE VERY SPORTS MINDED EVEN AT THEIR YOUNG AGE AND UH ONE OF THEM_1'S IN SOCCER AND THE OTHER ONE JUST LOVES TO DO IT
AND SO WE GET OUT AND AND DO THIS AND IT I FOUND OUT THAT IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO THEM ALSO
IN MY OLDEST BOY'S SOCCER LEAGUE THAT UH HE DOESN'T SEEM TO RUN OUT OF BREATH AS MUCH AS THE OTHER BOYS DO AND
HE CAN STAY IN LONGER
AND UH
AND UH SO I- I DON'T HAVE A A REGULAR ONE BUT I I REALLY WOULD
LIKE TO SET MY PRIORITIES STRAIGHT I GUESS AND AND SET ASIDE TIME TO DO THAT
I THOUGHT OF DIFFERENT THINGS I THOUGHT ABOUT GOING AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY IN THE MORNING IF I AM GENERALLY UH GETTING UP AND HEADING OFF TO WORK AROUND SIX OR SIX THIRTY
WHICH MEANS I'D HAVE TO GET UP WAY EARLY IN THE MORNING IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING TO DO THAT AND UH I'VE ALSO TRIED TO SET ASIDE TIME IN THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING
BUT UH THINGS GENERALLY POP UP THAT PRECRU PRECLUDE ME FROM FROM DOING THAT SO I JUST NEED TO GET INTO A HABIT
UM-HUM

WELL GREAT
UM-HUM
OH OKAY
WELL

FIVE DAYS A WEEK AND UH IT I- IT'S A REALLY GOOD SUPPLEMENT TO YOUR BIKE RIDING
UH IT HELPS WITH FLEXIBILITY AND UH
F- UH FOR SOME OF THE EXERCISES SHE USES THREE POUND WEIGHTS

AND THEY SORT OF DRIVE KIND OF WILD FOR ABOUT TWO THREE WEEKS THEN THEY FINALLY SETTLE DOWN AND REALIZE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE THAT WAY HERE AND UH THAT TAKES THE STRAIN OUT OFF OF EVERYONE THAT UH IS DRIVING A VEHICLE
AND I FIND THAT THE MOST OF THE REPAIRS I HAVE TO DO HERE IS BODY DAMAGE DUE TO THE SALT THAT WE HAVE TO PUT ON THE ROAD TO UH TAKE CARE OF US IN THE WINTER TIME
UH I HAVE A SIXTY NINE COUGAR AND A SEVENTY SEVEN PONTIAC SO FORTH AND I HAVE TO UH AND I DRIVE A HONDA MOST OF THE TIME
AND I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT UH SALT AND SO FORTH ARE KEPT OFF OF IT AND ONCE IN A WHILE WE HAVE TO REPLACE SOME OF THE PLATES IN THE BOTTOM OF IT BECAUSE IT'S RUSTED AWAY

YEAH WELL UH
GUESS UH I'M TWENTY THREE ARE YOU OLDER THAN I AM
SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER -PINION OF OF WHAT
HUH
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN LOOKING BACK NOW KNOW WHAT WE KNOW NOW I MEAN IT WAS JUST A COMPLETE DISASTER
UM-HUM
YEAH I JUST THINK
THAT THE GULF WAR WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY
UM
I KNOW IT'S I KIND OF LOOK AT IT AS A LITTLE BIT OF PROPAGANDA IN A WAY BECAUSE I MEAN W- BASI- WENT IN AND SPENT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND
JUST BEAT UP ON A
INFERIOR YEAH INFERIOR ARMY THAT WAS JUST W- WANTING TO QUIT AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOOD AND I MEAN IT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH PRIDE ONE CAN REALLY TAKE IN THAT AND
UM-HUM
OH YEAH THAT'S JUST UM
I'VE SEEN UH YOU KNOW APOCALYPSE NOW AND UM
UH WHAT WAS THE ONE WITH UM CHRISTOPHER WAKEN AND UM
THE DEER HUNTER YEAH I'VE YOU KNOW AND THE JUST A LOT OF OTHER I GUESS INFERIOR ONES MADE BUT I MEAN AS FAR I THINK APOCALYPSE NOW AND UM DEER HUNTER WERE JUST
JUST INCREDIBLE MOVIES YOU KNOW DEER HUNTER'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A INCIDENT BUT
YEAH HEART OF DARKNESS YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT THAT WAS UH IT'S GREAT THEY HAD IT ON SHOWTIME UM  BEFORE THEY RELEASED IT TO THEATERS FACT
AROUND THE SUMMER AND UH IT'S REALLY SOMETHING IT'S ALMOST IT IT'S JUST AS ENTERTAINING IF NOT MORE ENTERTAINING THAN A FILM IS BECAUSE IT'S
RIGHT SHE JUST SHOT DOCUMENTARY YOU KNOW HAD LIKE A LITTLE HAND HELD CAMERA AND YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING'S BEEN EDITED TOGETHER BUT WHEN MARTIN SHEEN HAD HIS HEART ATTACK IT'S JUST AMAZING WHAT YOU KNOW FRANCES IS JUST
IT IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THE ACTUAL EVENT IT CAPTURES HIM GETTING UH SOME TREATMENT AFTER IT HAPPENED BUT SHE HAD A TAPE REPORTER RUNNING WHEN HE WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE ABOUT IT AND
HE'S JUST LITERALLY FREAKING OUT I MEAN ABOUT HE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW HOW BECAUSE HE'S AS THE WHOLE TIME I GUESS WHEN IT WAS BEING MADE UM I WAS JUST A KID BACK THEN BUT I GUESS IT'S JUST
THE PEOPLE BACK IN AMERICA JUST WERE HEARING ABOUT IT HOW IT WAS JUST SUCH A DISASTER THIS IS LIKE THE LAST THING HE NEED IS IS FOR MARTY TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK I MEAN YOU'LL YOU'LL LOVE IT I MEAN IT'S IT'S REALLY GREAT UM
THE VIETNAM WAR
YEAH I'M FORTY ONE SO I WOULD UH
WELL I UH WAS IN COLLEGE WHEN THE WAR ESCALATED TO IT'S HEIGHT AND UH
I GUESS MY FEELING IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF UH THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE
EVENT UH
IT'S REAL INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS NEW MOVIE JFK WHICH IS
APPARENTLY LINKING THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION TO HIS DECISION TO HI- UH UH THE APPARENTLY PEOPLE UH WHO WORKED FOR KENNEDY SAY HE DIDN'T DECIDE THAT HE WAS GOING TO
PULL OUT OF VIETNAM WAS NOT GOING TO COMMIT MORE TROOPS THAT THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF THOSE PEOPLE SAY BUT THEY THAT HE HAD COME TO THAT CONCLUSION
I THINK IT WAS UH
PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS A REALLY UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE COMMUNISM WAS SELF DESTRUCTING EVEN THEN AND UH
THE HISTORY OF VIETNAM WHICH HAS BEEN UH REPRESENTED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMENTARIES AND DOCUMENTARIES ONE ON THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM
UH IT SEEMS THAT IT JUST DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN AND I THINK UH ITS A VALUABLE
UH IF PAINFUL LESSON FOR THIS COUNTRY
RIGHT
AT THE TIME I WASN'T THAT UH
WASN'T THAT SURE I- I- I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT AND WASN'T THAT POLITICALLY ACTIVE UH
BUT IT WAS
UM
APPARENTLY SOMETHING THAT COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED AND I YOU KNOW I- I LOOK AT WARS GENERALLY AS FALLING INTO THAT CATEGORY UM
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT THE UH THE GULF WAR COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS A REMARKABLY PAINLESS WAR AND AS WARS GO
RIGHT
THIRD WORLD COUNTRY REALLY
WELL I THINK WHAT WHAT'S UH I- I GUESS I'D USE THE WORD RELEVANT TO THE VIETNAM WAR QUESTION IS THAT THE VIETNAM WAR WAS APPARENTLY AVOIDABLE TOO IT WAS A TIME WHEN HO CHI MINH
APPARENTLY CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AND SAID LOOK IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE ME WITH SUPPORT ALL I WANNA DO IS UNIFY VIETNAM
AND UH HE WAS TURNED AWAY BY TRUMAN UM
SO IT'S
HUM
A PAINFUL LESSON I GUESS ONE THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO LEARN I'M REALLY IMPRESSED BY HOW MUCH EFFECT SOME OF THESE MOVIES HAVE HAD ON PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS THE JFK MOVIE'S CAUSE CAUSING ONE PERSON AFTER ANOTHER TO
CALL FOR THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SEALED
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THE VIETNAM WARS UM ANY OF THE VIETNAM WAR MOVIES
OH THE DEER HUNTER
YEAH
THOSE TWO YEP
YEAH THEY WERE THEY'VE
YEAH WELL THEY WERE BOTH REMARKABLE FILMS AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE'S A NEW FILM OUT ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR ABOUT THE MAKING OF APOCALYPSE NOW WHICH ITSELF IS SUPPOSE TO BE A GREAT YEAH HAVE YOU IS IT GOOD
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HIS WIFE APPARENTLY MADE IT FR- DOCUMENTARY
OH IS IS THAT ON FILM DI- TH- THAT GET CAPTURED ON FILM
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
OKAY HAVE YOU HAD TO RETURN ANYTHING LATELY THAT YOU'VE BOUGHT
YEAH
OH YEAH THAT'LL BE NICE
I HAVEN'T EITHER REALLY
RIGHT RIGHT WELL I THINK IT'S GOTTEN EASIER NOWADAYS IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING AND YOU HAVE TO RETURN IT MOST MOST PLACES ARE WILLING TO YOU KNOW GO WITH THE CUSTOMER
UM-HUM
ON UH YEAH I KNOW TH- I KNOW
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE I HAVEN'T HAD TO RETURN ANYTHING THAT I CAN THINK OF BUT UH YOU KNOW WI- LIKE RADIOS AND THINGS THEY'VE BECOME SO CHEAP THAT EVEN IF THEY DO BREAK IT'S BETTER JUST TO GO GET ANOTHER ONE THAN HAVE IT FIXED
YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH UH THE STUFF LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
YEAH AND I YOU KNOW LIKE TELEVISION AND STEREOS AND THINGS THEY'RE A LOT CHEAPER IF THEY'RE JAPANESE MADE
YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I THINK SO BUT UM I'VE HAD TO RETURN UM I THINK A TELEVISION ONE TIME AND UM
UH THE COLOR WENT OUT BUT AND IT WAS LIKE A MONTH LATER AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WHATSOEVER WHICH I THINK IS GOOD BUT
YOU KNOW YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T NEVER HAVE TO RETURN ANYTHING EVERYTHING WORKED FOR SO LONG
OH YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL WELL THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER GOTTEN ANYBODY OUTSIDE OF TEXAS
REALLY
WOW
OH MY HEAVENS BUT LET'S SEE UM I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER PRODUCTS I'VE TAKEN BACK
UM CLOTHES IS ABOUT MAINLY WHAT I'VE YOU KNOW GOTTEN LATELY AND I THINK THEY'VE GONE DOWNHILL
A- AS FAR AS UNLESS YOU IT'S YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR THE SMALL MAN
TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW WITH THE THE HOMEMADE THING
YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
RIGHT
WOW THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING
HUM
LET ME THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE HERE
UM I CAN'T THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS CLOTHES YOU KNOW AND AND THEY'RE GOING UP SO HIGH IF YOU WANT A WELL MADE YOU KNOW PIECE OF CLOTHING
OR IN MATTER OF FACT FURNITURE ALSO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO YOU HAVE TO PAY A LOT MORE IT'S THE OLD ADAGE YOU GE- GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
BUT UM YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN GET OH I KNOW I BOUGHT A REAL CHEAP COUCH ONE TIME AND IT LOOKED GOOD BUT IT WAS CHEAP AND IT DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG YOU KNOW
I THINK THE FRAME OF IT WASN'T REALLY GOOD BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY MASS PRODUCED
YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
HUM
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR WATER HEATER
IF Y-
UM  NO NOT REALLY I UH I MAY HAVE HAD TO HAVE A
A FEW MINOR REPAIRS BUT I HAVEN'T BOUGHT ANYTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCES OTHER THAN CLOTHES AND THINGS AND I WILL BE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE I'M GONNA BE BUYING A BIG COMPUTER AND
UM  ONE OF THESE EIGHT MILLIMETER CAMCORDERS
SO I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN STUDYING THESE THINGS BUT UH I HAVEN'T HAD TO RETURN TOO MANY THINGS I
I- I- I TRY TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN I PICK UP SOMETHING AND AND LOOK IT OVER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO TO WORK
AND
I THINK IT REALLY TURNS DOWN TO
PICKING WHO YOU WANT TO BUY FROM AND I HATE TO SAY IT BUT THE F- THE ELECTRONICS DEVICES THAT I BUY THE THE ONES IN JAPAN IN GENERALLY
ARE MUCH HIGHER QUALITY FROM WORKING
I MEAN I HATE TO ADMIT IT BUT IT'S TRUE THEY AND THEY HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF UH COMPLETELY WORKING MODELS THAT GET OUT TO THE PUBLIC
YOU THAT'S RIGHT YOU YOU WERE SPEAKING OF THAT ABOUT A WEEK AGO I BOUGHT MYSELF A NEW DIGITAL WATCH
THAT WAS MADE IN CHINA
WORKS JUST FINE AND IT COST ME FOUR DOLLARS
YES IT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT
YES
UH-HUH
THAT'S RIGHT AND AND AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY UM WAY IT'S BEEN FOR ME FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS THA- I RETURNED A TV SET TO BE REPAIRED BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT UH WE HAD A A LIGHTNING STORM AND
THE LIGHTNING FLASHED IN THROUGH THE POWER AND UH HURT SOMETHING IN IT SO IT WASN'T THE SET'S FAULT AT ALL IT WAS JUST UH ONE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
NO
WELL I TELL YOU MOST OF MY TALKS ARE IN TEXAS THAT'S TRUE I BUT I'VE BEE- I'VE BEEN UH TALKED INTO UM  CALIFORNIA TWICE IN THE LAST UH WEEK OR TWO
SO IT'S UH IT'S NICE BUT BUT I KNOW HOW IT IS IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF TEXAS YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN TEXAS I SUPPOSE
YEAH
WELL WE'RE BEING FILLED UP WITH A LOT OF
OF STORES THAT HAVE HUGE QUANTITIES OF OF UH CLOTHES AND ARTICLES AND YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT WAL-MARTS AND G- GEE BEES AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS AND
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN SUPPORT ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THE AN- AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN STAY ALIVE IS TO BUY CHEAPER PRODUCTS SO THEY CAN PUT THEM ON THE MARKET CHEAPER FOR THE PUBLIC
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS MORE OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE UH INFERIOR WORKING ABILITY AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO START RETURNING THEM
SO
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT AND I- I- I HAVE A FRIEND WHO DOES MAKE UH BEAUTIFUL FURNITURE BUT HE HAS TO CHARGE TWICE AS MUCH WHEN YOU GO TO A STORE
IF IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S WELL MADE BUT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT
YEP
HUH
YES
DO YOU
HUM
ACTUALLY I HAD SOME UH I BOUGHT A WATER SOFTENER FOR MY HOME
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO RETURN IT BUT IT DIDN'T WORK WELL AND I F- I FINALLY HAD TO HAVE THE COMPANY COME OUT AND TO CHECK IT OUT SO I DID HAVE THAT PROBLEM
AND IT WAS A MA- I THINK IT WAS MORE OF THE INSTALLATION WAS PART OF THE PROBLEM THAN THE MACHINE ITSELF
YES UH WE LIVE UH RIGHT TO THE BASE OF THE WASATCH FRONT SO UH UH AS OUR CHILDREN WERE GROWING UP WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME CAMPING UP IN THE MOUNTAINS DIFFERENT TAKING OUR CHILDREN WITH US OR DEER HUNTING OR WHATEVER

YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE SO WELL BUT UH YEAH I GUESS ANYBODY THAT THAT WATCHES THOSE UH YOU KNOW PROBABLY THINKS UH OCCASIONALLY ABOUT IT THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT JEOPARDY IS THAT THEY NEVER DO UH

UH UH COM- YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO GET TO BE A C- A COMPETITOR
WELL THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT THAT COULD BE IT AND THEN AGAIN IT COULD JUST BE THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO WRITE IN YOU KNOW EXPRESSING AN INTEREST I DON'T KNOW
UM  UM THERE'S A THERE'S ONE THAT STARTED THIS SEASON IT'S CALLED UH HOME IMPROVEMENT
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH I SAW THAT

UH-HUH

UH-HUH
REALLY
THAT'S GOOD UH DO YOU EVER FEEL SOMETIMES YOU'D LIKE TO COMPETE IN ONE OF THOSE
UH-HUH
COMPETING
DO YOU THINK MAYBE THEY PICK THEM OUT OF THEIR UH AUDIENCE
UH-HUH
DO YOU HAVE ANY SITUATION COMEDIES THAT YOU REALLY LIKE
I SAW THAT ONE TIME AND I DIDN'T CARE FOR THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE KIDS WERE UH VERY UH OBSTINATE AND RUDE AND IT WAS THEY WERE TRYING TO TEACH THEM MANNERS
DID YOU SEE THAT ONE
AND I DIDN'T LIKE THAT ASPECT SO I AND THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE I WATCHED BUT I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO A SECOND TIME
I DON'T CARE FOR HER EITHER
I JUST I JUST I BUT I LIKE EVENING SHADE HAVE YOU WATCHED THAT LATELY
IT REALLY IS
UH-HUH
THAT'S GREAT UM
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THOSE UH TWINS AND TRIPLETS THAT ARE ON THOSE SHOWS YOU EVER THINK ABOUT UH
HOW THEY CAN TEACH THEM AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE
YEAH
OKAY WELL I DON'T HAVE AN ELDERLY PERSON THAT I COULD SEND TO A A NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING MY BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE DEAD
BUT I DID HAVE A FRIEND THAT WAS IN A CONVALESCENT HOME UH LIKE A NURSING HOME
AND I H- WENT THERE VERY OFTEN TO VISIT HER AND UH
MADE ME FEEL REALLY SAD IF I DID HAVE A MOTHER LIVING I DON'T THINK I COULD DO THAT
I THINK THEY WOULD BE BETTER OFF BEING AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY
YOU KNOW
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH I CAN BELIEVE THAT YES BECAUSE MOST ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE HAVING A LOT OF NOISE AND KIDS RUNNING AROUND AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER
UM-HUM
OH YEAH
UM-HUM
OH
UH-HUH
OH SEE NOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S REALLY A SAD SITUATION
YEAH REALLY YOU KNOW I JUST
UM-HUM
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH IN A CASE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU MORE OR LESS THINK IT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF SHE WERE IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY GROWING UP WHERE
UH-HUH UH-HUH
UH-HUH BUT THE COST OF THESE NURSING HOMES ARE SO
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THAT
YOU KNOW SO YOU REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE THAT WAY IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT RICH OR S- YOU KNOW UM
I KNOW THIS LADY THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS A FRIEND OF MINE NOW HER HUSBAND WAS STILL ALIVE AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS IN THERE YOU KNOW AND IT WAS COSTING HIM A SMALL FORTUNE TO KEEP HER IN THERE
SO
UM-HUM
YEAH THEN BRING HER BACK HOME AT NIGHT
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH YOU KNOW JUST COME HOME FOR DINNER AND THEN USUALLY THEY WANT TO GO TO BED PRETTY EARLY ANYHOW YOU KNOW SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE NICE IF WE COULD EVER GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
HM
UM-HUM
YEAH
IF IF THEY DON'T KNOW ANYBODY AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THEM AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT WELL I CAN SEE MAYBE A NURSING HOME WOULD BE BETTER YOU KNOW
BUT IF THEY THEY HAVE THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM AND EVERYTHING WHY
IT'S KIND OF HARD
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
WELL UH MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID SHE HOPES SHE NEVER HAD TO BE LIKE THAT AND
UH LUCKILY I MEAN SHE LIVED BY HERSELF AND THEN YOU KNOW ONE DAY SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND SHE WAS GONE SO SHE NEVER DID HAVE TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S
SO MANY OF US KIDS THERE WAS LIKE SEVEN OF US THAT MY WE WOULDN'T HAVE PROBABLY ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN ANYHOW
YOU KNOW SHE COULD'VE TAKEN TURNS LIVING WITH EACH ONE OF US YOU KNOW FOR A SH- A SH- A PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE WE ALL DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME CITY ANYHOW O- NOR THE SAME STATE
SO
UH UH A C- I HAVE A COUPLE MORE THAT LIVE OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEN I HAVE A BROTH-
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND START OFF
I AGREE ALTHOUGH WE'RE IN THAT SITUATION RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A AN EIGHTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MOTHER-IN-LAW LIVING WITH ME RIGHT NOW
AND BECAUSE OF HER CIRCUMSTANCES SHE CAN NO LONGER LIVE INDEPENDENTLY
AND EVEN MOVING FROM HER HOUSE TO OUR HOUSE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY UNSETTLING FOR HER AND WE HAVE SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEY ABOUT DRIVE HER CRAZY
WELL WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE STRUGGLED A LOT WITH IT BECAUSE AGAIN UH MOST OF THE NURSING HOMES I'VE BEEN IN ARE VERY DEPRESSING TO ME
AND SHE'S STILL ALERT ENOUGH THAT I THINK SHE WOULD REALLY KNOW THAT WE WERE PUTTING HER THERE AND I THINK SHE'D REALLY RESENT IT
AND I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY HARD BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I SEE MY WIFE WITH I GUESS OUR YOUNGEST ONE NOW IS FIVE
AND HER TRYING TO STRUGGLE BECAUSE HER MOTHER REALLY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF HERSELF SHE NEEDS TO BE BATHED AND DRESSED AND A LOT OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
AND SO THE DRAIN ON THE FAMILY
AND WHEN THE KIDS HAVE KIDS COME OVER YOU KNOW SHE'S ALWAYS SAYING WELL WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE HERE WHY CAN'T THEY SEND THEM HOME IT'S TOO NOISY AND SHE'LL SAY THAT TO THE KID'S FRIENDS
SO IT'S A HARD SITUATION EITHER WAY I THINK
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE REALLY WRESTLING WITH WHEN DOES IT BECOME DETRIMENTAL TO OUR FAMILY TO THE POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT AS OPPOSED TO CONSIDERING HER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND
OH PROHIBITIVE
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOME ALTERNATIVES LIKE ADULT DAY CARE
THAT'S MORE READILY AVAILABLE YOU KNOW I THINK IF WE COULD SEND HER SOMEPLACE FOR THE DAY
AND SHE COULD BE AROUND SOME ELDERLY PEOPLE AND HAVE SOME ACTIVITIES WOULD BE OF MORE INTEREST TO HER AND THEN IN THE EVENING HAVE HER RETURN AND BE WITH THE FAMILY
YEAH
BUT THERE'S NOT MANY OF THOSE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE VERY HARD TO GET THEM INTO AND
WE TRIED SENDING HER TO A SENIOR CITIZEN CENTER BUT THEY'RE REALLY NOT PREPARED TO COPE WITH HER BECAUSE SHE'S SOMEWHAT SENILE AND SO A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE ENGAGED IN SHE CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN
BUT I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE GRAYING OF AMERICA WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO AS A AS A COUNTRY FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS
BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION AND YOU KNOW YOU HATE SEEING THEM JUST SORT OF SEND OFF AND NOT WELL CARED FOR
AND YET
AND THEN I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITY TOO YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD BE UP AND DOING SOME THINGS IT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN WHEN THEY'RE JUST SORT OF NEEDING ALMOST CONSTANT SUPERVISION AND CARE
YEAH
DO YOU LIVE AT ALL CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
OKAY UH UTAH HAS A A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM WHERE UH
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I CAN'T REALLY
SEE THE DIFFICULTY UH OR ANY PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE OTHER THAN
THEY KEEP SAYING THE ACT SCORES WERE A LITTLE LOW
OR LOWER THAN WELL WE'RE A- ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BUT
THEY'RE TALKING IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALL THE TIME THAT WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES IN SCIENCE AND MATH
WHICH I THINK THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO TO INCREASE THAT SO
I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S SE- ANY SERIOUS UH PROBLEMS WITH OUR
SCHOOL SYSTEMS HERE IN UTAH
UH WHAT ABOUT TEXAS
UH-HUH
YEAH
WE- I HA- I HATE TO HEAR IT
HUH
WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE KIND OF CONTROLLING THE THE SCHOOLS THEN IN SOME AREAS
OH BOY
YEAH THAT'S NOT GOOD UH I'D HATE TO TEACH UNDER THOSE SITUATIONS
WELL WELL THAT HASN'T GOT HERE YET I HOPE IT IT DOESN'T BUT UH
IT I KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE A FEW GANGS HERE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOLS
YEAH
BUT THAT'S WHERE IT BEGINS I GUESS
UH-HUH
BUT AT LEAST UH
I I GO INTO THE SCHOOLS QUITE A BIT IN MY OCCUPATION
THE DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE
IN THE SIX WESTERN STATES THAT I
I WORK IN
AND UH
GENERALLY FROM WHAT I CAN SEE THE UH
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT TYPE OF PROBLEMS IN ANY OF THE STATES YET
BUT I KNOW TALKING TO MY UH COUNTERPARTS BACK EAST THAT THEY'RE
THEY HAVE UH SECURITY GUARDS THAT PATROL THE HALLWAYS AND
AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD LEARNING SITUATION IF YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE POLICEMEN THERE TO
KEEP KIDS IN CLASS AND
SO IT SOUND LIKE THAT'S IT'S KIND OF GETTING TO THAT POINT IN TEXAS IN AT LEAST WHERE YOU'RE AT
YES
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE AND I I THINK THAT UH
I- IN OUR UTAH SCHOOL SYSTEMS WE
WE'VE KIND OF REVERSED GOING FROM THE SOCIAL CLASSES BACK TO
A LOT OF THE ACADEMIC CLASSES THAT UH THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY
AND I THINK THAT IS THAT'S A GOOD CHANGE TO
TO GET BACK INSTEAD OF SO MANY UH
OFF THE WALL CLASSES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ACADEMIC E-
YOU KNOW EDUCATION
UH
YES THERE DOES UH YOU CAN'T UH
GO FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER AND
TH- THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE THERE'S GOT TO BE BOTH THERE BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER ON THE ACADEMIC UH PORTION
IN ORDER TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE SOCIETY TODAY WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE THEY'VE
THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE A GOOD MATH AN ENGLISH BACKGROUND IN ORDER TO COMPETE
NO THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT UH IN SOME OF THE STATES BACK HERE ARE GOING TWO HUNDRED DAYS A YEAR INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR SCHOOL YEAR IS THERE BUT
UM-HUM
WE HAVE A A THERE'S A LITTLE OF THAT GOING ON HERE BUT IT'S ALL IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES IT'S NOT IN THE UPPER UH
IN THE SECONDARY AREA
BUT I IT'S THERE'S SOME TEST CASES TO SEE UH IF THE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO IF THEY DON'T LOSE AS MUCH UH
THEY'RE ABLE TO RETAIN MORE WHERE THEY'RE ONLY OUT FOR A MONTH INSTEAD OF THREE MONTHS AND THEY HAVE TO GO
UH-HUH
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE UH
IN YOUR AREA AND THIS AREA TOO THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM THAT THEY SEE AS A PROBLEM
OH I'D SAY UH WE PROBABLY HAVE WHAT COU- COULD BE DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS PROBLEMS
FROM UH
GUN TOTING KIDS TO UH
LOW GRADES ON THE TEENS TEST
THEY UH
THEY GOT A PRETTY MUCH OF A HANDFUL OF
PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SAY THAT BUT THEY'RE UH
ARE HAVING TO UH
PUT IN
METAL DETECTORS AND
SECURITY AND
INDEED
YEAH THAT'S BAD NEWS I TELL YOU THEY UH
COURSE IT ALWAYS SOUNDS A LOT WORSE THAN IT IS I SUPPOSE BUT
YEAH
YEAH THEY UH
I DON'T KNOW I THINK THEY UH
THEY NEED TO UH
GET BACK TO THE BASICS I THINK WE
THROWING A LOT OF MONEY AT THE PROBLEM BUT IT HASN'T UH SEEMED TO
DO WHAT'S NECESSARY YET
I THINK LEARNING SOCIAL INTERACTION IS GOOD TOO BUT UH I THINK IT HAS TO BE A BALANCED CURRICULUM
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH I DON'T THINK UH AMERICAN SCHOOLS IN GENERAL ARE UH
COMING UP TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING TO Y- THEY'RE ACTUALLY TESTING OUT WE JUST HAD IT ON THE NEWS TONIGHT ABOUT THE UH YEAR ROUND SCHOOL
THEY GO FOR THREE MONTHS AND THEN TAKE A MONTH OFF OR SOME-
UM-HUM
EXACTLY I THINK THAT WAS THE UH THING THEY MENTIONED TOO
OKAY
WELL ARE YOU THERE
OKAY WELL I JUST BOUGHT A NEW CAR THAT'S WHY I CHECKED UM

BUT I DON'T KNOW I THINK I WANT A A CHEVY BLAZER OR A GMC JIMMY TRUCK IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR A WAGON TYPE OF DEAL
IT'D BE GOOD I LOOK WAS I LOOKED AT A TOYOTA 4-RUNNER ACTUALLY IT'S THE SAME TYPE OF DEAL BUT SMALLER KIND OF LIKE THE S-10S
FOR THE CHEVYS AND I DON'T KNOW I LI- I LIKE THE BIGGER ONES BETTER THAN THE SMALL ONES IF YOU'RE GONNA BUY A TRUCK YOU MIGHT AS WELL BUY THE REAL ONE INSTEAD OF A TOY TRUCK
YEAH
YEAH
UH THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD I USED TO HAVE A AN S-10 A LITTLE TRUCK I DON'T KNOW WAS IT WAS MORE LIKE HAVING A CAR THAN A TRUCK SO I DECIDED THIS TIME I'LL GET A BIG ONE
YEAH
HE WANTS A BIG ONE AGAIN YEAH
THAT HAS A LOT OF ADVANTAGES AND I'M UP HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SO UP NORTH WITH THE SNOW AND EVERYTHING IT'S A A BIG ADVANTAGE TO US
YOU FROM TEXAS BY THE WAY YEAH YEAH MOST OF THE PEOPLE I TALK TO ON THIS ARE FROM DOWN THERE I'M ONE OF THE FEW N- EAST COAST PEOPLE
WELL THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD DO YOU SHOP AROUND PRETTY MUCH WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING FOR YOUR CAR OR
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH THAT'S GREAT
ARE THOSE UM FOUR CYLINDERS DO YOU KNOW OR SIX CYLINDER FOUR CYLINDER
YEAH YOU GET PRETTY GOOD GAS MILEAGE LIKE
AROUND THIRTY OR MORE THAN THAT EVEN OR
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S ABOUT WHAT MY WIFE'S CAR GETS
LITTLE BIT OVER THIRTY WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD I CAN'T COMPLAIN RIGHT NOW I HAVE A FORD ESCORT WHICH IS THE TERRIBLE CAR BUT IT GETS GOOD GAS MILEAGE SO I CAN'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH BUT IT'S UGLY AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL COMFORTABLE OR ANYTHING BUT
I BOUGHT IT USED AFTER I GRADUATED FROM SCHOOL AND IT'S GETTING THE JOB DONE BUT IT'S NOTHING THAT I REALLY ENJOY
UH MY BROTHER USED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE
YEAH
YEAH LOT OF TIME IN THE SHOP
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW ABOUT THAT I HAD A I HAD A
FORD THUNDERBIRD FOR A WHILE AND
FIXED OR REPAIRED DAILY IS THE JOKE ABOUT THE FORD AND IT WAS PRETTY ACCURATE WITH THAT CAR I SWORE UP AND DOWN I NEVER OWN ANOTHER FORD AS LONG LIVED AND I ENDED UP ANYWAY
OH I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER HAVE ANOTHER ONE AFTER THIS ONE BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T TOO MEAN TO ME
UM DO YOU TEST DRIVE A LOT OF CARS BEFORE YOU UM BOUGHT THEM
YEAH
YEAH
-KAY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT
I AGREE WITH THAT
UM-HUM
YES I HAVE THE SAME THING HERE
YEAH THAT KIND OF GOES RIGHT ALONG WITH WHAT I'M THINKING TOO IS WELL THE MOVIES AND THE TV THE VIOLENCE AND ALL THE
THINGS THAT ARE ON THERE IF THE PARENTS WERE HOME IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME HOME MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T BE WATCHING AS MUCH AS THIS
BUT THEN AGAIN THERE'S SOME OF THEM AT HOME AT NIGHT WITH THEM THAT DO NOT MONITOR WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING
AND SO IT'S I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT IT IS PARENTS CARING ENOUGH TO MAY BE PUT OFF HAVING THAT OTHER CAR OR THE OTHER TV OR WHAT EVER IT IS THEY'RE WORKING FOR
AND TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN
UM-HUM
YES I- I CAN BELIEVE THAT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT BUT AND MAYBE NOT QUITE SO MUCH PUBLICITY EITHER I THINK THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH PUBLICITY ON SOME OF THESE VIOLENT CRIMES THAT AND THEN IT SEEMS TO BECOME A CHALLENGE
TO BE SHOWN TO PEOPLE TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT
RIGHT THAT IT'S
UM-HUM WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND ALL THESE GOOD THINGS  THE CHILDREN ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER
YES AND AND
R- RIGHT YES AND UNTIL THE FAMILIES CHANGE I THINK THAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT WILL WORSEN
YES UH-HUH UH BACK TO THE OLD BASIC MORALS AND
AND THINGS THAT
I- I DON'T KNOW I- I THOUGHT THEY DID BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ALSO SO WELL BUT IN
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL I FEEL LIKE THE MAJOR PROBLEM WE HAVE AND THE REASON THAT CRIME HAS GOTTEN SO OUT OF HAND IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A PUNISHMENT THAT'S MATCHING WHAT'S BEING DONE
AND I THINK IT STARTS WHEN THE KIDS ARE LITTLE I THINK THE PARENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A LOT OF PARENTS ESPECIALLY WHERE I'M AT I HAVE A LOT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT EVER IS DONE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER MOTHERS AT HOME
AND I SEE A LOT OF KIDS VERY SMALL KIDS COMING HOME TO EMPTY HOMES EVERY DAY AND DOING ALL KINDS OF UNBELIEVABLE THINGS AND AS LONG AS THEY DON'T LET ANYBODY KNOW ABOUT IT THEY GET AWAY WITH IT  SO
YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE IF OUR PA- MOTHERS STAYED HOME IF WE HAD THAT SECURE START YOU KNOW WHERE KIDS LEARNED THE RIGHT WAY TO ACT UM THEY WERE REWARDED FOR THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR
AND THEY HAD A SECURE FAMILY THAT THEY CAME FROM I THINK WE'D SEE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SOCIETY
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
AND I FOUND OUT THAT MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO
THE MOTHERS WENT TO WORK TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND WHEN I TALKED WITH THEIR CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN WANTED THEIR PARENTS HOME RATHER THAN THE THE MATERIAL THINGS THEY WERE GETTING
AND IT'S JUST TOO BAD THAT THE PARENTS WON'T LISTEN TO THIS SURVEY
SO  I JUST THINK THAT UM ANOTHER PROBLEM IS I THINK THE WAY THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET UP THAT THE CRIMINALS GET OUT AND THE JAILS ARE SO OVER CROWDED THEY CAN'T HANDLE PUNISHING THIS THE
PEOPLE THAT ARE COMMITTING THE BAD CRIMES
SUFFICIENTLY I THINK THEY NEED TO PUT MORE PEOPLE OUT TO DEATH UM IF IT'S COMPLETELY WITNESSED AND IT'S UH SEEN THAT THERE'S NO
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT BUT IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR
RIGHT I THINK THAT
TO OH OUT DO IT
YEAH OR OUT DO WHAT'S BEEN DONE
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM UM I KNOW THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS READING A BOOK WHEN I WAS STUDYING HISTORY
AND IT SAID YOU SHOW ME A COUNTRY THAT CAN PRODUCE STRONG FAMILIES AND YOU'LL HAVE A STRONG COUNTRY
AND IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER UNITED STATES HISTORIES OUR COUNTRY WAS STRONG UNTIL THE MOTHERS STARTED LEAVING THE HOME
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEY DO AND THEN THEY GROW UP AND IT JUST CONTINUALLY WILL GET WORSE
SO
I GUESS WHAT WE BOTH AGREE ON IS THAT FAMILIES NEED TO CHANGE THEIR WAY OF THINKING
RIGHT AND I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A AN IDEA OF WHY WE'RE HERE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THESE THINGS RATHER THAN JUST GETTING AHEAD MATERIALISTICALLY
THAT'S RIGHT  WELL UM DO THEY CO- DO THEY COME ON AND SAY WHEN WE'VE TA- VISITED FOR FIVE MINUTES
THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME
UM
WE DISCUSSED I DISCUSSED ON HERE WITH SOMEONE UM LAST WEEK ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW IT COULD BE IMPROVED ON JURIES AND WE DISCUSSED ABOUT HOW HALF THE JURY THAT THEY SELECT TO
YOU KNOW COME UP WITH THE VERDICT IF HALF OF THOSE WERE LAW STUDENTS THEN THEY COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE COURT ROOM
AND HAVE THE TIME THAT THEY SPENT IN THEIR JURY DISTRICT COUNT TOWARDS SOME OF THEIR GRADUATION HOURS
WOULDN'T THAT BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE I THINK SO SOMETIMES THE JURIES DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THIS THE LEGAL YOU KNOW TALK AND AND WHAT'S GOING ON
AND THIS WAY IT WOULD GET PEOPLE THAT WERE A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE AT LEAST HALF OF THEM
WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN THAT UH GO TO COLLEGE WENT TO COLLEGE ARE ABOUT TO GO OR ANYTHING
OH MY GOODNESS OH WHERE DID THEY GO
UH-HUH
UH-HUH OH MY GOODNESS WELL YOU ARE A VERY EXPERIENCED PERSON
UH I HAVE A SON AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WHO IS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND UH HE HAS UH MADE THREE APPLICATIONS TO SCHOOLS THAT GIVE A DOUBLE DEGREE PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED TO UH TAKE
SO HE APPLIED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN AND TO THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND TO RICE
SO UH HE'S WAITING AT THIS TIME UH TO UH SEE WHAT KIND OF UH ACCEPTANCES AND MONEY GRANTS MIGHT UH COME IN FOR HIM
SO UM I- I THINK THAT UH IT BECAME VERY EVIDENT IN THE BEGINNING OF SENIOR YEAR
WHEN HE ACTUALLY HAD TO SIT DOWN WITH THE APPLICATIONS HE HAD ABOUT SIX SCHOOLS THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN
BUT HE REALLY DECIDED THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE ENGINEERING BUT HE ALSO WANTS TO KEEP A LIBERAL ARTS
DEGREE AND ACTUALLY GET BOTH OF THEM
SO HE HE WEEDED OUT THE ONES UH THAT DID NOT OFFER THAT KIND OF THING AND JUST REALLY WOUND UP MAKING THREE APPLICATIONS  SO UM
YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH RIGHT WELL YEAH AND AND AS I SAW THE FALL PROGRESSING AND UM
AND HIS VIEWPOINT IT REALLY BECAME MORE EVIDENT THAT UH

OH WHO AM I TALKING TO
OH I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT  WELL
YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE I I'VE TRIED TO MAKE THESE PHONE CALLS UM WHENEVER IT POPS IN MY HEAD AND SOMETIMES THEY SAY OH WE CAN'T FIND ANOTHER PARTY AND AFTER TH-
THEY SAY THAT TWO TIMES I CAN'T KEEP HANGING ON THE PHONE AND I JUST SAW THAT CARD DOWN THERE AND NOW I'M REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE BAKING BREAD FOR CISTERCIAN  SO ANYWAY
OH WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OH THAT'S RIGHT WE'RE ON THIS RECORDING THING WELL ANYWAY UM WE USED TO GO CAMPING OUT IN CALIFORNIA UP BY MENDOCINO AND UM  TO UM
UH LASSON PARK WHICH IS A VOL- A VOLCANIC PARK AND UH THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY AND THE RANGERS THERE THAT UH
DO THE TOURS AND THE LITTLE CLASSES AND THE LECTURES AND EVERYTHING WERE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY SO THAT WAS UH ONE OF OUR UH MAJOR CAMPING TIMES THAT WE ENJOYED VERY VERY MUCH
UH DO YOU EVER GO CAMPING OUTSIDE OF THE BOY SCOUTS
OH YES
UH-HUH
OH MY
UM-HUM UM-HUM UM
UM-HUM
OH THAT'S TRUE TOO
UH-HUH
WE TOOK ONE CANOE TRIP IN CALIFORNIA NOW BUT THE BOYS WERE VERY VERY SMALL WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE AND UM IT WAS A FRIEND OF WEBBIE'S THAT GOT THIS GROUP TOGETHER
AND UH THERE HAD BEEN SOME RAINS AND THEREFORE THE RIVER WAS A LITTLE MORE SWIFT THAN WHAT MIGHT NORMALLY BE EXPECTED AND UM
I- I I FOUND IT EXCITING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A TRIFLE DANGEROUS MAYBE BECAUSE THE CURRENTS WERE KIND OF BAD AND WE JUST WENT AHEAD ANYWAY BUT IT WAS THE RUSSIAN RIVER YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT CAN AND IT DID AND UM IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IT WAS WEBBIE'S FIRST TIME DOING THIS ALSO AND WE JUST T- UH TRUSTED IN THE UH KNOWLEDGE OF
THIS FRIEND THAT GOT THIS PARTY TOGETHER THAT IT WOULD NOT BE OVER DANGEROUS AND WE HAD OUR
LIFE BELTS ON AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT BUT WE DID DUMP OVER ONCE AND UH YOU KNOW WITH SMALL CHILDREN LIKE THAT JUST MADE ME VERY NERVOUS WE DIDN'T GO AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WE JUST UH KIND OF UH
STAYED BY CAMP SITE AND UH COOKED  BUT IT IT WAS IT WAS VERY EXCITING AND
REALLY VERY NICE AND UM I WOULDN'T MIND DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN
AND I GUESS THE FIRST TIME YOU DO A MAJOR ENDEAVOR LIKE THAT YOU REALLY ARE A NEOPHYTE YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT OR EVEN SOMETIMES WHAT TO DO  BUT UM
IT IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE UH
UM-HUM UM-HUM YEAH YEAH SO
OH YES WELL SEAN IS DANIEL WENT LAST SUMMER SO
NO NO NO HE'S NOT GONNA GO AGAIN THIS TIME BUT UH YOU'RE GONNA INHERIT SEAN ON THIS TRIP AND UH UM-HUM
I KNOW UH-HUH HAVE YOU BEEN OUT THERE BEFORE OH YOU HAVE- WELL DANIEL SAYS IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY QUITE CHALLENGING
UH WELL YEAH A FAIR AMOUNT MOSTLY WITH BOY SCOUTS
WELL MOSTLY UH WELL BOY SCOUT CAMPS NEAR UH NEAR DALLAS UH
I- IN FACT I I THINK I KNOW YOUR SONS DANNY AND SEAN RIGHT JAN NOVAK
BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT CAMPING NONE THE LESS
THEY DIDN'T
BUT WE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT CAMPING BECAUSE THEY'RE RECORDING THIS
UM-HUM
WELL WE USED TO DO A LOT OF CAMPING UH IN FACT BEFORE WE HAD KIDS MARIE AND I WOULD GO
WE DID A LOT OF CANOE CAMPING UH EITHER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF LAKES UP NEAR LAKE PLACID AND IN THAT AREA AND IN NORTHERN ONTARIO WHICH IS ALSO FULL OF LAKES
AND SOME OF OUR LONGEST TRIPS WENT FOR ABOUT SIX DAYS AND COVERED ABOUT SEVENTY MILES WHERE YOU YOU CANOE
UH FROM LAKE TO LAKE SOMETIMES BY RIVERS WHERE THEY CONNECT OR ELSE YOU HAVE TO PORTAGE YOUR CANOE AND ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT TO THE NEXT LAKE
AND SO THAT THAT WAS A I I THINK IT'S A LOT IN A WAY EASIER TO GO CANOE CAMPING BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THE WEIGHT SO MUCH
AND IT'S ALSO CLEANER BECAUSE YOU CAN GO SWIMMING EVERY DAY AND IT'S VERY EASY TO KEEP KEEP COOL AND KEEP CLEAN
AND THAT'S
WHAT WHAT RIVER WAS THAT YEAH I'VE S- I'VE SEEN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WE NEVER WENT CANOEING ON IT THAT THAT CAN GET PRETTY FAST
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
SURE SURE
YEAH WELL YOU YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
YOUR YOUR GUYS ARE GOING TO PHILMONT ARE THEY
AGAI-
RIGHT SO DANNY'S NOT GOING AGAIN
OKAY WELL I'LL I'M GOING WITH THEM SO
NO
REALLY
THIS RECYCLING IT'S UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING BUT WE ARE NOT DOING A WHOLE LOT HERE IN ARLINGTON ABOUT IT UH THEY HAVE A TRIAL SECTION THAT UH
PART OF THE CITY HAS BEEN GIVEN THESE UH PLASTIC GARBAGE CANS WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO SEPARATE AND PUT IT OUT
I DON'T HAPPEN TO BE IN THE PART OF THE CITY THAT DOES THAT THOUGH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YES
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OH THAT'S INTER- THE GROCERY STORES HERE HAVE USUALLY HAVE SOME BINS FOR THE PLASTIC BAG RECYCLING AND SOME OF THE PLASTIC JUGS AND BOTTLE TYPE THINGS
UH-HUH
WE DON'T HAVE VERY UH I DO NOT KNOW OF A VERY GOOD PLACE FOR GLASS HERE
BUT I DON'T I WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO TAKE GLASS
OH YES THEY'LL RECYCLE THOSE WE HAVE PLACES FOR THOSE AND UH FOR A WHILE THEY WERE THE NEWSPAPERS THERE WERE PLACES BUT I THINK THEY HAD SO MANY NEWSPAPERS NOW THEY ARE KIND OF DISCOURAGING US FROM TAKING THEM ANY PLACE
UM-HUM
YES I KNOW AND WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM  BUT UH
UH-HUH
I SEE
UH-HUH
HUM
YES
OH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
OH
BUT DO YOU ALL HAVE ANY PLACE AROUND THERE FOR UH USED OIL CAR OIL
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
HUH
RIGHT UH-HUH UH-HUH
MY GOODNESS
SO
RIGHT
RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA THE
CITY FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS HAS CERTAIN THEY  HAD A TRIAL SECTION THAT WAS HAVING CURB SIDE RECYCLING WITH SPECIAL CONTAINERS
AND THEN THEY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND PHASE IT IN PIECE BY PIECE SO EVERY YEAR A DIFFERENT PIECE OF THE CITY GETS ADDED TO THE LIST
BUT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD THEY HAVE HAD VOLUNTARY RECYCLING FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW
YOU ON THE FIRST AND THIRD SATURDAYS OF EVERY MONTH YOU TAKE YOUR
BOTTLES AND YOUR NEWSPAPERS AND LETS SEE BOTTLES NEWSPAPERS TO CERTAIN CORNERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND THERE IS A FARMER'S MARKET THAT COLLECTS THE PLASTIC THEY UH
IT USE TO BE A FIREHOUSE
BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SOME URBAN RENEWAL GOING IN HERE AND TRYING TO MAKE THE AREA SAFER I LIVE NEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WHERE I'M A GRAD STUDENT
AND IT'S NOT THE SAFEST NEIGHBORHOOD THERE IS
SO THEY ARE TRYING TO GET URBAN RENEWAL GOING AND THEY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS FARMER'S MARKET DOES IS COLLECT PLASTIC
AND THEY USE THAT MONEY TO KEEP UP THE BUILDING AND ORGANIZE EVENTS AND THAT KIND OF THING
RIGHT THEY HAVE THAT FOR THE PLASTIC BAGS HERE TOO YEAH LET'S SEE AND THE
UM
UH-HUH HOW ABOUT ALUMINUM CANS DO THEY RECYCLE THAT
RIGHT WELL THE ONLY PART THE THING IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY ISN'T PROFITABLE TO JUST FROM UM A STANDPOINT OF MAKING NEW PAPER TO RECYCLE
BUT WHERE YOU END UP HAVING A SAVINGS IS AT YOUR LANDFILL LAST SO MUCH LONGER
DOWN HOME I KNOW MY FOLKS
UM
LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THEY HAVE HAD SOME LANDFILL FILLING UP PROBLEMS AND THEY COUNTY BUILT A NEW LANDFILL AND A SITE THAT WASN'T GEOLOGICALLY PROPER
SO THAT THE LANDFILL CONSIDERATION IS A GOOD REASON THAT PROBABLY COMMUNITIES ARE STILL GOING TO END UP PAYING TO HAVE THE PAPER TAKEN AWAY BUT THEY'LL JUST WON'T HAVE TO BUILD LANDFILLS AS OFTEN
ANOTHER THINGS THAT THEY ARE DOING NOT AT HOME BUT IN THE OFFICES HERE IS RECYCLING OF PAPER AND
THAT IS DONE BY SEPARATING THE WHITE PAPER WHICH IS I GUESS IS A HIGHER QUALITY
FROM THE MISCELLANEOUS PAPER
AND WELL THEY ALSO  RECYCLE ALUMINUM CANS
THEY HAVE EVERY OFFICE HAS TWO LITTLE CARDBOARD BOXES FOR PUTTING IN THE WHITE PAPER AND THE MIXED PAPER
AND BIG TRASH CANS DOWN AT THE ENDS OF THE HALLWAYS THAT WHEN THEY GET FILLED UP YOU CAN GO TAKE THEM DOWN THE HALL
OH YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE THING THAT KIND OF BOTHERED ME I NOW WHEN I I USE TO GET MY O- MY OIL CHANGED WHEN I GO DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA THERE HAS BEEN A GOODYEAR TIRE STORE THAT HAS BEEN SERVICING MY CAR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
AND THEY HAVE PRETTY ECONOMICAL RATES BUT NOW IN SOUTH CAROLINA THERE IS THIS
MANDATORY WASTE RECYCLING FEE AND MY DADDY W- WOULD LIKE TO TO GET THE USED OIL TO POUR OVER FENCE POSTS
SO YOU KNOW TO MAKE THE FENCE POSTS LAST LONGER AND WEATHER BETTER BUT THE OIL THE THE UH GOODYEAR STORE WON'T EVEN
THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GIVE YOU THE OIL THEY SAY IT'S AGAINST THE FEDERAL LAW NOW
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO CHARGE THE WASTE RECYCLING FEE
SO THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET IN SOUTH CAROLINA ANYWAY AND THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR USED OIL BACK IS TO DO IT YOURSELF
UM-HUM
MUCH THE SAME THING THERE IS NO CURB PICK UP OF UH
ACTUALLY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THE UH
HANDICAPPED SOCIETIES TYPE OF PLACES WHERE THEY UH
ONE THEY DO AS JUST A RECYCLING OPERATION AND THEN OTHERS THEY UH COLLECT THE PAPER AND SHIP IT TO OTHER RETAILERS SO UH WE'RE ABLE TO UH
HAVE DROP OFF BINS FOR NEWS PAPERS AND CARDBOARD AND THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN THERE ARE
THERE'S A UH DEPOSIT PROGRAM ON PLASTIC AND GLASS CONTAINERS WELL PRIMARILY SOFT DRINK BOTTLES AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO UH
REHABILITATION CENTERS AND THEN THEY RECYCLE THE CONTAINERS  THEY REFUND THE DEPOSIT WHICH IS ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO FIFTEEN CENTS A CONTAINER AND THEN
RIGHT YEAH ON THE ON PRIMARILY ON SOFT DRINK POP AND THAT KIND OF THING
AND UH SO THEY INDUCE RECYCLING OF PLASTIC AND GLASS SOFT DRINK CONTAINERS UH WE DO HAVE
O- ONE OF THE SCRAP METAL DEALERS THAT WILL ACCEPT TIN AND ALUMINUM  CANS AS WELL
UH IT'S FAIRLY FAIRLY EXTENSIVE BUT AGAIN IT'S UH IT'S THE INITIATIVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON BECAUSE THERE IS NO COORDINATED PICK UP BY THE CITY
WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S
THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH
GENERALLY THE UH
THE HANDICAPPED GROUP TAKES CARE OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLACED A DEPOSIT WHICH IS THE INDUCEMENT TO RE- RECYCLE THE BOTTLE SO THAT YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK
AND THEN THE RECYCLER RUN BY THE HANDICAPPED SOCIETY PAYS BACK THE COST OF THAT DEPOSIT
AND THEN I HAVE A THEN THEN THEY IN TURN WILL GET
UM YEAH  UM I GUESS PARTLY BECAUSE OF OUR CLIMATE HERE IN SASKATOON AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF
CENTRAL C- UH WELL I WANT TO SAY CENTRAL CANADA BUT CENTRAL CANADA TENDS TO BE REFERRED MORE TO ONTARIO AND QUEBEC
BUT UM
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A SITUATION WHERE WE MIGHT CALL THEM HOMELESS PEOPLE WE CERTAINLY HAVE A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ON WELFOR WELFARE AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT KIND OF THING  UM
THERE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE AGAINST
EMPLOYING PEOPLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING ALTHOUGH UM
SCOUTS AND
HOCKEY TEAMS AND BALL TEAMS THOSE KINDS UM REGULARLY DO BOTTLE DRIVES WHERE THEY GO AROUND IN VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS AND COLLECTING THE BOTTLES AT INDIVIDUAL HOMES
THEY HAVE DONE IT SOME
UM BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY QUITE AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF COLLECTING UH NEWSPAPERS THEY'RE ACTUALLY AT
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SHOPPING CENTERS LIKE THE SHOPPING MALLS THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTAINERS WHERE THE GROUP CALLED COSMOPOLITAN INDUSTRIES
COLLECTS OR PEOPLE CAN DROP THEIR USED NEWSPAPERS AND OTHER PAPERS IN THE BINS AND THEN THE BINS ARE COLLECTED
HEY STEVE UM THEY JUST UH THEY JUST STARTED A RECYCLING PROGRAM HERE I THINK ACTUALLY THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH RECYCLING PROGRAM BUT UM INSTEAD OF JUST LIKE TOSSING EVERYTHING AWAY WHICH I ALWAYS FELT BAD ABOUT
UM I'M STARTING TO SPLIT STU- SP- SPLIT STUFF OFF THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THEY DON'T PICK IT UP AT THE CURB THEY MAKE ME DRIVE IT LIKE A MILE DOWN THE ROAD AND SPLIT IT OUT DOWN THERE WHAT ARE THEY DOING UP THERE
BUT THE DEPOSITS ONLY ON LIKE DRINK STUFF
OKAY
OKAY
OH OKAY
SO IS THEY YOU'RE GIVING ARE YOU GIVING THESE PRODUCTS TO THE HANDICAPPED GROUP AND THE HANDICAPPED GROUP IS GETTING THE UH THE MONEY
OR OR YOU GOT OR THEY SOMEHOW DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS BACK TO YOU
OH OKAY
THAT'S VERY COOL YOU KNOW THERE'S A I I HEARD ABOUT A A SIMILAR PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE UH I THINK IT'S CALLED LIKE HOMELESS INCORPORATED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WHAT THEY DO IS EMPLOY UM HOMELESS I THINK MOSTLY MEN BUT HOMELESS PEOPLE
TO UH GO OUT AND COLLECT ALL THE RECYCLABLE CANS AND AND I THINK IT'S MOSTLY CANS THERE MAY BE BOTTLES AS WELL BUT LIKE BEER CANS SODA CANS AND WHAT NOT AND THEY UH BRING THEM UP TO A ONE
LO- ONE CENTRALIZED LOCATION AND UH ARE ABLE TO COLLECT THE MONEY FROM THE VARIOUS BEER AND AND SODA MANUFACTURERS AND UH AND AND GET MORE MONEY TO THESE PEOPLE THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT
YEAH
DO THEY DO IT WITH NEWSPAPERS AS WELL
HM
OKAY SUPPOSEDLY WE'RE RECORDING RIGHT NOW
UH IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE NEARLY THIRTY MINUTES AGO I WAS READING AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE NEW INFINITY I FORGET WHAT MODEL NUMBER IT WAS BUT ONE OF THE FEATURES THEY WERE TOUTING WAS A FREON FREE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
YEAH THIS IS THE FIRST I'D SEEN OF IT TOO UM ACTUALLY I WAS KIND OF I'M SU- KIND OF SURPRISED THAT THAT
HAS BECOME AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS IT HAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THESE THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BE CLOSED SYSTEMS EITHER WHETHER THE PROBLEM'S DUE TO LEAKS OR DUE TO FAILURES I WOULD THINK THAT UM
YEAH IF IT WAS DESIGNED WITH REASONABLE PRUDENCE STUFF WOULDN'T GET LOOSE AND UM I MEAN YOU DON'T WANT IT TO IT'S NOT CHEAP AND THE THING FAILS WHEN IT DOES
SO I'M KIND OF SURPRISED IT BECAME AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS IT HAS
UM
UM-HUM
YEAH
SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE OTHER BIGGIES BEING IN THAT REALM YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE COULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS A BAD THING
YEAH YEAH I UM TRADED CARS RECENTLY AND WENT FROM A CAR THAT GOT SEVENTEEN MILES PER GALLON
OF WORTH OF O- ON PREMIUM AND DIDN'T REALLY WASN'T HAPPY WITH PREMIUM WASN'T HIGH ENOUGH
TO A CAR THAT GETS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILES PER GALLON ON UH THE CHEAPEST GARBAGE YOU CAN PUT IN IT
SO I PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED MY SHARE THERE AND UM KIND OF INTERESTING COURSE UM THERE IS TALK ABOUT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BAN
THE MANUFACTURE OF AN ENGINE THAT REQUIRED LEADED FUEL AT SOME POINT AND UM
THIS I BELIEVE HAS I READ HAS PUT THE GENERAL AVIATION UH WORLD GOING NUTS BECAUSE
A GENERAL AVIATION ENGINE CAN COST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO OVERHAUL AND IF IT FLIES A HUNDRED HOURS A YEAR
THAT'S MODERATELY HIGH SO THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS SPENT PER UNIT OF POLLUTION SAVED
UM ARE VERY VERY TINY AS COMPARED TO A CAR WHERE IT'S A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ENGINE AND IT'S RUNNING FOR A LOT LONGER PER YEAR
UM SO IT'S A QUESTION OF UM NOW APPARENTLY UH THE EPA THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AGAIN AND DECIDED THAT
THESE THAT THAT GENERAL AVIATION ENGINES WON'T COUNT
AND THEY'LL ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO BURN LEADED FUELS BUT THERE'S SOME CONCERN OVER IF THIS IS THE ONLY MARKET IS ANYBODY GONNA WANNA BOTHER MAKING LEADED FUELS
IT'S AN OLD JOKE ABOUT THE UH FINEST CONGRESSMAN MONEY CAN BUY
SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER ISSUE UM
YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS VIEWED IT AS UM THE POLLUTION ISSUE AS A PROPERTY RIGHTS ISSUE IF UM SOMEBODY DUMPED THEIR GARBAGE IN YOUR FRONT LAWN
UM REGULARLY
YOU'D HAVE LEGAL RECOURSE BUT IF HE DUMPS IT INTO THE AIR SURROUNDING YOUR HOUSE YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY
AND UM I THINK THEREIN LIES A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S IT'S VIEWED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY FROM PHYSICAL POLLUTION
THAT'S INTERESTING I HADN'T SEEN THAT I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT FREON CONTRIBUTING TO THE
THE UH HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER AND OTHER VARIOUS POLLUTION BUT UH OTHER THAN
UH MAKING THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS TIGHTER I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANY WORK ON UH ALTERNATE COOLANTS
UM-HUM
THE UH THE THE TIMES THAT I'VE SEEN ANY SORT OF OF LOSS IS UH
AT A TIME WHEN MAYBE I'D HAVE UH THE THE UH FREON CHECKED IN THE AIR CONDITIONER OR MAYBE TOPPED OFF
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY'D PRACTICALLY WASTE ALMOST AS MUCH AS UH THEY'D PUT IN THE CAR BUT I'VE NOTICED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT UH THE CONTROLS ON THAT ARE
TIGHTER UH PEOPLE ARE A LOT MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
WELL OBVIOUSLY CARS UH AND TRUCKS CONTRIBUTE QUITE A BIT
AND PERSONALLY I'LL UH I CARPOOL UH MOST OF THE TIME WITH SOMEONE I WORK WITH BUT MY SCHEDULE DOESN'T UH
DOESN'T MAKE FOR A CONSISTENT CARPOOL
UM-HUM
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION UH THE LEADED FUELS HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN OUT OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THERE'S ALWAYS TALK ABOUT UH
ABOUT REGULATING THE EMISSIONS THAT A A CAR ENGINE CAN PRODUCE AND TIGHTENING DOWN ON THAT AND OF COURSE THE UH
THE LARGE AUTO MAKERS IN THIS COUNTRY SPEND UNTOLD MILLIONS TO LOBBY TO KEEP BUSINESS JUST THE SAME AS USUAL
THERE'S A BIG ISSUE IN RHODE ISLAND RIGHT NOW UH THERE'S A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUILD A COAL FIRED UH ENERGY PLANT VERY CLOSE TO TO DOWNTOWN PROVIDENCE
AND THEY ARE PULLING ALL SORTS OF TRICKS TO MANEUVER AROUND VARIOUS CONTROLS AND INSPECTIONS AND REGULATIONS APPARENTLY THE
THE REGULA-
OKAY SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS O- ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
YES
SO ARE THEY CURRENTLY PRACTICING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN YOUR STATE
YES THAT'S SIMILAR TO GEORGIA UH
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE CONSIDERING
YES YES UM I GUESS IN A WAY THAT IT IT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IF
YES
RIGHT THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT OF IT
WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IF IT WAS APPLIED
IN A MORE EXPEDIENT MANNER IF THERE WEREN'T SO MANY APPEALS YEAH IF IF THE PERSON WHO'S GONNA COMMIT THE CRIME KNEW THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE PUNISHED SEVERELY POSSIBLY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
UH I'M A RESEARCH ENGINEER I WORK UH F- WITH GEORGIA TECH
UM
YES
HUM
UM-HUM
UM THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE BUT I GUESS
THERE'S OTHER FACTORS THAT BUT PU- PU- PUMPING MORE MONEY INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS A GOOD THING BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
OH I SEE
UM-HUM
UM
SO THAT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION
UM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE WH-
HUM
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S NOT AN EASY SOLUTION THERE'S THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION FOR THAT
UM-HUM
I'M SURE IT IS YEAH
HUM YEAH I DON'T I DON'T CERTAINLY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ISN'T GONNA SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT
UH
I GUESS I AM FOR CERTAIN CRI- YEAH IN CERTAIN CRIMES
UM PREMEDITATED MURDER
CRIMES OF THAT NATURE I THINK SHOULD DEFINITELY ANY MASS MURDERER TYPE INDIVIDUAL
HUM
UM-HUM
WELL YOU ALWAYS HAVE CASTRATION
YES I READ ABOUT THAT
UM-HUM
I HAVE AMBIVALENT FEELINGS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT SERVES AS A KIND OF DETERRENT WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT IS
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN YOU KNOW TEXAS HAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY
AND IT'S EATING US ALIVE BUDGET WISE
AND UM
YES WE DO PRACTICE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT THE NATURE OF THE UH COURTS AND THE APPEALS AND THE STAYS AND ALL THAT MEANS THAT IT'S A VERY LONG HAUL BEFORE ANYBODY'S EVER EXECUTED
YEAH AND THEN I WAS READING IN THE PAPER JUST THIS MORNING IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAD FORGOTTEN I GUESS THAT I WROTE THIS LITTLE TOPIC DOWN THAT IT COSTS MORE TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY THA- THAN IT DOES TO KEEP THEM
BECAUSE OF ALL THE COSTS OF THE APPEALS AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW
WELL I THINK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
PRIMARILY A DETERRENT TO OTHER PEOPLE
YOU KNOW WHO WOULD SEE IT
YEAH BUT I'M NOT SURE
HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT IS
QUICKER MAYBE YEAH
UM-HUM
WHAT WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO
HUM WELL SEE I'M A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
AND IN A VERY POOR SECTION OF TOWN WITH PR- PREDOMINANTLY ANGLO KIDS
AND I SEE KIDS ALREADY THAT ARE GONNA BE CRIMINALS
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE CAN DO
AND SEE I'M AFRAID I THINK IF WE WOULD TAKE THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND INVEST IT IN YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT I MEAN COURSE YOU COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
BUT I THINK IF WE WOULD MAKE A BIGGER INVESTMENT IN KIDS
WE'D HAVE FEWER DECISIONS TO MAKE
DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW
OH YEAH
WELL I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
SEE I'M TALKING ABOUT LIKE IN IN UH
I'M AFRAID I THINK THAT THERE ARE KIDS WHO JUST OUGHT TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR HOMES
AND
REARED
UH I KNOW INSTITUTIONS DON'T WORK THAT WELL BUT IT'S A BAD DAY BECAUSE BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THESE KIDS THROUGH MY OFFICE I HAVE A SCHOOL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN KIDS
FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM ARE GOOD SOLID KIDS AND I HAVE THE SAME THIRTY SEVEN IN MY OFFICE EVERY DAY
AND A LOT OF THEIR PARENTS ARE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE
SOME OF THEM IN THE PENAL SYSTEM
AND YOU KNOW YOU JUST SEE THOSE KIDS GOING DOWN THE ROAD NOW NOT ALL OF THEM WILL COMMIT OFFENSES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN YOUTH CENTERS
AND THAT KIND OF THING AND IF WE HAD SOMETHING TO DO BEFORE THEY GET TO BE FULL BLOWN ADULT CRIMINALS
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NECESSARILY IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM I'M NOT SURE THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE AGENT OF ALL THE SOCIAL ACTION
I THINK THAT'S ONE REASON WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL SYS-
UH AND SOME OF THEM ARE OUR PROBLEMS BUT A LOT OF IT'S BECAUSE EVERYTHING SOCIETY WANTS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SUBJECT BUT
ANYWAY I DEALT WITH TWO OR THREE KIDS TODAY THAT ARE GONNA END UP
WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE A DECISION WHAT TO DO WITH THEM
UM-HUM I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS AN EASY SOLUTION BUT
IF YOU COULD FIND A WAY TO PREVENT SOME OF IT AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD BE
IT WOULD BE MONEY BETTER SPENT
THAN DO YOU KNOW IT COSTS MORE TO KEEP AN INMATE ON DEATH ROW THAN IT DOES TO SEND A KID TO HARVARD
THAT'S TRUE
STATISTICALLY THAT'S TRUE
UM-HUM
ARE YOU FOR IT
I'M FOR IT IN IN SOME CASES YEAH
WHAT KIND OF CRIMES WOULD YOU DO USE IT FOR
UM-HUM
I- I WOULD CONSIDER IT FOR SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN
ON GOING
YOU KNOW NOT ONE INSTANCE BUT PERPETUAL ABUSERS OF CHILDREN
WELL YOU KNOW SOMEBODY ELECTED THAT RECENTLY
AND ALL THE CIVIL RIGHTS PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW
BUT UH
WELL I'VE RECENTLY DROPPED MY SUBSCRIPTION TO THE LOCAL PAPER WELL NOT EXACTLY LOCAL IT'S A PRETTY BIG ONE THE ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION BECAUSE I WAS THOROUGHLY AND TOTALLY DISGUSTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PAPER
WAS REALLY PRETTY POOR AND I COULDN'T SEE SPENDING HALF AN HOUR A DAY LOOKING THROUGH THAT
YEAH I TRY AND WATCH THE NEWS AS WELL WE GET UH CABLE HERE AND WATCH HEADLINE NEWS BUT IT'S SUCH A
I DON'T KNOW THERE'S REALLY VERY LITTLE DEPTH TO IT THEY SEEM TO BE REALLY OUT TO TRY AND ENTERTAIN MORE THAN UH
YOU KNOW PASS ON ANY REAL INFORMATION IT'S PRETTY TRASHY I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT
UH
THE I THINK MORE THE UH THE JUST THE THE REAL LACK OF MEAT BEHIND IT I THINK THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN SOME LOCAL NEWS MAGAZINE RECENTLY THAT MENTIONED IT  TALKED ABOUT THE UH UH LEVEL OF
UH READING ABILITY OR SOMETHING OR OTHER AND THINGS LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH'S UH STATEMENTS TO THE PUBLIC AND THEY WERE COMPARING HIM WITH MICHAEL DUKAKIS BACK DURING THE OLD UH
THE THE LAST ELECTION NONSENSE AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW DUKAKIS HIS STATEMENTS WERE LIKE IN A TENTH TO TWELFTH GRADE READING LEVEL WHILE BUSH'S WERE DOWN AROUND AN EIGHTH GRADE LEVEL AND BY THAT
UH BEING ABLE TO CONVEY TO THAT LAR- MUCH LARGER OF AN AUDIENCE YOU KNOW HE
WAS SUPPOSEDLY THAT MUCH MORE AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATOR AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE NEWS IS THEY'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH MAYBE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT IT'S JUST COMING OUT REALLY PRETTY POOR
UM
YEAH I AGREE
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S LIKE UH TRYING TO MAINTAIN A TEMPERATURE IN YOUR HOUSE BY RUNNING THE HEATER AND THE AIR CONDITIONER AT THE SAME TIME
YEAH
YEAH THEY ARE GOOD
I'M SURPRISED AT THE THE THE RANGE AND QUALITY OF THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE LIKE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN THERE'S SUCH A BROAD UH SPECTRUM OF SCIENCE AND YET IT'S REALLY IN DEPTH AT THE SAME TIME
YEAH AND NATIONAL
HELD BY THE SAME COMPANY
YEAH I AGREE WE RECENTLY HAD NEWSWEEK AT THE HOUSE BUT WENT AHEAD AND DROPPED IT DECIDED IT REALLY WASN'T WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR AND WE STARTED SUBSCRIPTION TO U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT BUT IT HASN'T STARTED ARRIVED YET
GOING TO TRY AND EVALUATE THAT YOU KNOW ANOTHER INTERESTING SOURCE OF NEWS IS THE IS E-MAIL THE NETWORK NEWS DO YOU GET THAT
YEAH ME TOO I REALLY IF IF I WHEN I MOVE WHEN I GO TO MY NEXT JOB I'M REALLY GOING TO BE UH UPSET IF I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT
OH THAT'S CHEAP AND YOU GET TO CALL IN ACROSS A MODEM
OH
MAN
EXCELLENT YEAH THAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE A A ONE OF THE CUTTING LEADING
YEAH I DID THE SAME THING ACTUALLY I UH DON'T HAVE A I'M NOT SUBSCRIBING ANYMORE
ARE YOU UNHAPPY WITH THE UH WITH THE HOW SHOULD I SAY IT UH
THE ONE-SIDEDNESS OF IT OR OR THE
MY MY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T UH
HOW SHOULD I SAY IT I I CAN EITHER GET UH THINGS ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER BUT NOT UH A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION
THAT RELATES TO WELL HOW SHOULD I SAY I EITHER GET THESE HIGHLY POLARIZED THINGS
AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE I SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO DO UH
UH
WE'RE GOING TO BE FAIR SO WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT TWO HIGHLY POLARIZED ARTICLES WHICH WHICH IS UH BETTER THAN THAN ONE BUT UH
SO UH ANYWAY SO WE'RE UH
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS THAT THAT UH
AS YOU SAID UH A LOT OF THE ARTICLES ARE THEY'RE EITHER FLUFF
UH WELL ACTUALLY OUT OF THE PRESS THEY'RE THEY'RE FLUFF OR THEY'RE UH
PRETTY SHALLOW BUT
COURSE I H- I ALSO HAVE THE OPTION AND I GUESS YOU DO TOO OF SIGNING UP FOR ONE OF THESE
UH UH SPECIALTY MAGAZINES WHICH IS LIKE IN THE CASE OF UH
SCIENCE YOU KNOW YOU SIGN UP FOR
UH
NATURE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO NEWS UH IT'S A I FIND IT I I THINK THE REASON PERHAPS FOR THAT IS THAT THE UH
THE UH PRESS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IS IS BECOMING A
UH HOW SHOULD I SAY IS BECOMING
THEY'RE NOT NEIGHBORHOOD UH PRESS ANYMORE
THEY'RE WORRIED MORE THEY'RE MORE LIKE U S A TODAY TYPE THINGS UH PRETTY SHALLOW AND AND CAN WE MAKE IT UH AND THEY'RE RUN BY YOU HAVE TEN NEWSPAPERS THAT ARE RUN BY UH
UH
YEAH
OH YEAH THAT'S YES THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST INTER- THAT'S HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS
WELL THERE ARE SOME PLACES HERE IN TOWN UH FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE
UH
HAVING UH WITHDRAWAL PAINS SO TO SPEAK UH THERE'S A BOOKSTORE THAT HAS A UH
UH SUBSCRIPTION TYPE THING WHERE YOU CAN PAY THE GUY FORTY DOLLARS A A YEAR WHICH IS PRETTY SMALL POTATOES
YEAH CALL IN ON THE MODEM AND YOU CAN READ YOUR NEWS AND I MEAN READ YOUR MAIL AND UH AND UH LOOK AT THE ALL THE DIFFERENT INTERNET UH
UH GROUPS
IT IS
THEY CAN BE DECEIVING TO PEOPLE I DID NOT WORK THERE LONG BECAUSE I COULDN'T HANDLE THE THE TREATMENT THAT THE CHILDREN GOT AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A VERY WELL-KNOWN CENTER HERE IN TYLER WHO HAD TWO OR THREE UM CENTERS
ALL OVER YOU KNOW THE UM CITY AND THEY WOULD UM BE ONE WAY WHEN THE PARENTS WERE THERE AND BE ANOTHER WAY WHEN THE PARENTS LEFT
SO UM I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE YOU KNOW IF YOU DO DO DAY CARE CENTERS YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD MAKE FREQUENT CHECKS
AND UM TO CHECK IN ON THEM WHEN THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING IT BECAUSE THEY DO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND
SO
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL THIS ONE WAS SET UP GOOD I MEAN THEY HAD TWO TEACHERS TO EVERY ROOM
UM SOMETIMES THREE AND THEY HAD A GOOD SYSTEM LIKE SO WHEN YOU WALKED IN EVERYTHING LOOKS COOL
THE PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT
THEY DID NOT SHOW AFFECTION TO THE CHILDREN ENOUGH THEY DID NOT SHOW THEM CARE TO THESE SMALL CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING LEFT
UM THEY
ONE TIME I PICKED UP THIS LITTLE BOY WHO WAS CRYING AND THE OWNER CAME AND JUST CHEWED ME UP ONE SIDE AND DOWN THE OTHER YOU KNOW HE SAID YOU ARE GONNA HAVE EVERY CHILD IN HERE WANTING YOU TO PICK THEM UP
AND I SAID NO THIS CHILD WAS CRYING AND NEEDED SOME COMFORT YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
SO UM
YES
RIGHT THEY DID THEY HAD LIKE UM THE THE CRAWLERS THE BABIES THAT DIDN'T WALK IN ONE ROOM THE ONES THAT WERE STARTING TO WALK IN ONE ROOM THEN THEY HAD LIKE THE UM THREE THREE YEAR OLDS
UPPER FOURS LOWER FOURS UPPER FIVES LOWER FIVES YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW THEY REALLY DID SEPARATE THEM WELL IT WAS JUST THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES
RIGHT BUT YEAH THAT THEY'RE NOT
YEAH THEIR SYSTEM
RIGHT BUT THEIR BUT THEIR SYSTEM WAS WAS GREAT BUT UM THE
YOU KNOW THE CARING JUST WASN'T THERE THE ONE WOMAN THAT TAUGHT THAT DID THE BABIES
I WORKED WITH HER AND SHE WAS FABULOUS SHE LOVED THEM BABIES AND SHE LOVED THEM AND CARED FOR THEM BUT UM EVERY ONE OF THE OTHERS THAT I SAW WAS JUST SCREAMING AND YELLING AND
UM YOU KNOW WOULD MAKE ME A NERVOUS WRECK SO YOU KNOW
YEAH THESE KIDS ARE JUST IN A DAY CARE CENTER ALL DAY
AND UH WITH NO ANY TYPE OF EMOTIONAL
YOU KNOW GETTING LOVE GETTING CARE THEY'RE JUST THERE
YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THIS ROUTINE WHICH IS LOUSY
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
YEAH YOU DON'T SEE THAT MUCH
THAT'S CUTE
YEAH THAT HAS TO BE WITH A DAY CARE CENTER
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT THAT'S THAT'S A NEW ONE ON ME
UH-HUH
HM
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL THAT I KNOW WH- THE THINGS THAT WE KIND OF LOOKED AT IS IS YOU WANNA SEE HOW MANY TEACHERS YOU HAVE
AND AND HOW MANY KIDS THEY HAVE AND HOW THEY BREAK IT UP
BECAUSE WE HAD  WE HAD ONE THAT SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE WHAT YOU WERE IN
IT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD ONE AND IN FACT IT WORKED OUT FOR US BECAUSE MY WIFE WE KIND OF BARTERED MY WIFE DID ARTWORK FOR THEM AND THEN YOU KNOW SO WE GOT OUR
UH DAY CARE FREE
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS
AND
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
HM
YEAH
DID DID THEY SEPARATE THEM BY AGE GROUP
BECAUSE I'D THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT
UH-HUH
YEAH
IT IT SOUND YEAH
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME YOUR  YOUR CONCERN WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE LOVING PEOPLE
MAYBE PARENTS THEMSELVES OR SOMETHING
UH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH I- I- I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A REALLY IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE
DOCTORATES AND PHD'S AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING AND YOU KNOW KNOW ALL THE TECHNICAL STUFF
BUT IF THEY DON'T REACH OUT AND TOUCH THE KIDS THEN THAT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
AN-
THE OTHER THE OTHER GROUP THAT WE HAD WAS KIND OF INTERESTING THE OTHER ONE WE WENT TO THE IT WAS A HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM AND WE KNEW THEM FROM OTHER ASSOCIATIONS BUT
UH IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE WAS KIND OF THE STRICT ONE AND I THINK YOU KNOW SHE WOULD SHE'D PUT HER ARM AROUND THE KIDS AND TALK TO THEM AND STUFF YOU KNOW BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE MORE
UM
THE MORE UH WHAT DEMONSTRATIVE TYPE THE MORE LOVING HE WOULD YOU KNOW LAUGH WITH THE KIDS AND PLAY WITH THE KIDS AND
AND IT IT IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THAT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE MAN IN THE GROUP THAT
THAT DID THAT SIDE OF IT AN-
YEAH SO THEY HAD A REALLY NICE BALANCE WE LIKED THAT ONE IN FACT IT WAS CALLED HUMPTY DUMPTY PLAY SCHOOL OR SOMETHING BUT THEY ALSO DID
THEY ALSO DID SOME OF THE TEACHING THINGS AND THEN THEY HAD UM
YOU KNOW OBEDIENCE OBEDIENCE WAS IMPORTANT
AND YOU KNOW SO THEY U- YOU KNOW THEY USED UH
OH I THINK THEY USED THE YOU PROBABLY HEARD WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU STAND IN FRONT OF THE CLOCK AND GET YOUR POWER BACK TO CONTROL YOURSELF
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S ONE UH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY CALL IT EXACTLY BUT Y- YOU JUST STAND THEM IN FRONT OF THE CLOCK AND YOU KNOW IT HAS A SECOND HAND THAT GOES AROUND
WELL
IT'S UH I'LL START OFF HERE UH I DON'T KNOW I GET PROBABLY MOST OF MY INFORMATION EITHER FROM THE NEWSPAPER OR FROM CNN UM
I LIKE CNN BECAUSE IT UH YOU KNOW REPEATS IT WELL HEADLINE NEWS REPEATS EVERY HALF HOUR AND SO IT IT MAKES IT REALLY CONVENIENT BECAUSE I KEEP A RATHER HECTIC SCHEDULE
AND UH BUT THE NEWSPAPER PR- PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF DEPTH THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY GET FROM
RIGHT
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH I KNOW THE MY ONLY MAJOR OBJECTION IS THAT UH I DON'T THINK AMERICAN MEDIA SPENDS ENOUGH UH ATTENTION ON ON OUR CLOSEST NEIGHBORS LIKE MEXICO AND CANADA UH
UM-HUM YEAH
RIGHT YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW CANADA'S GOING THROUGH A LOT OF PROBLEMS NOW WITH WITH QUEBEC AND AND EVERYTHING AND UH
IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU KNOW I- I LISTEN TO DC AREA AND THE WASHINGTON POST YOU KNOW I MEAN THE MOST THEY'LL GIVE IT IS MAYBE THE BACK OF THE A SECTION
UM YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT EXACTLY YEAH I UH SPENT THIS PAST SUMMER UP IN CANADA UH WELL PART OF IT TOURING
AND UH YOU KNOW I- I WAS AMAZED BECAUSE I'D PICK UP A LOCAL PAPER AND I'D READ ABOUT ALL OF THESE YOU KNOW REALLY INTERESTING THINGS GOING ON THERE'S SOME SERIOUS TALK ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A A CANADA YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH QUEBEC AND N- I HAD NEVER HEARD ANY OF THAT BEFORE
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
OH YEAH
UM-HUM
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH
I- I THINK I'D AGREE O- O- OF A SIMILAR METHOD OF GETTING THE NEWS WITH ME TOO IT'S UH
UH CNN HAS BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO  THE T V SCENE HERE IN THE LAST UH NUMBER OF YEARS UH
PR- PRIOR TO CABLE YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T GET MUCH NEWS OFF OF NORMAL UH TELEVISION BROADCASTS
UH JUST USUALLY PRETTY LOCAL IN IN NATURE AND AND I LIKE UH CNN BECAUSE YOU GET SOME WORLD WORLD EVENTS TOO
UH WHICH IS NOT TOO COMMON ON ON THE OTHER FORMAT NEWSPAPERS AND SO FORTH
THAT THAT'S TRUE YOU KNOW YOU HARDLY EVER SEE UH HEADLINE ARTICLES ABOUT THE UH EITHER THE ECONOMICS OR OR OTHER WOR- NEWS EVENTS GOING ON IN EITHER OF THOSE COUNTRIES
UH WHEREAS IF YOU PICK UP A A EUROPEAN PAPER YOU KNOW UH IT ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRIES SOVIET UNION AND EVERYTHING HAS UH MAJOR NEWS UH ARTICLES IN THEM
YEAH
W- I'M I'M CURRENTLY LIVING IN DALLAS AND IT IT WO- IT WON'T EVEN GIVE IT THE BACK SECTION YOU JUST NEVER SEE YOU JUST NEVER SEE ANYTHING ABOUT IT UH
WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE YOU GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES UH AND AND THEY CARRY QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE US ON THE OTHER HAND AND IF YOU GO UP TO UH
CANADA THOSE PEOPLE ARE USUALLY PRETTY UH FAMILIAR WITH THE POLITICS GOING ON AND AND THE NEWS EVENTS IN THE US AND
AND WE'RE PRETTY UH LIMITED IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OF LEADERS UP IN CANADA OR MEXICO
YOU JUST YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
I'D I EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS AND THEN LATELY I'VE TAKEN THE TAKEN A LITTLE SHORTWAVE RADIO UH
AROUND AND PICKING UP THE BBC AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE UH A CNN TOO YOU YOU CAN TUNE INTO SOME STATIONS AND YOU GET SOME LIKE THIRTY MINUTE SUMMARIES OF OF NEWS EVENTS UH
I OCCASIONALLY GET INTO SOME OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN UH AREA AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN TELL WHAT'S GOING ON AT ALL
THERE'S NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF TELEVISION IN SOME OF THOSE PLACES
UM BUT THAT'S A GOOD POINT ABOUT ABOUT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT I GUESS YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HEAR IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU KNOW THERE WAS A A WHAT IS IT CALLED IS IT MEECH LAKE ACCORD OR OR YEAH THAT'S JUST SOMETHING UH
I'D SAY NINETY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE HERE WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD OF AND I THINK THAT I HEARD OF IT ABOUT THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS UP IN CALGARY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND
YOU KNOW PICKED UP A A PAPER AND STARTED READING A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT IT AND AND CA- CAME AND IT WAS A BIG THING GOING ON THERE AND I CAME BACK HERE AND NOTHING IN THE PAPERS
AND JUST DIDN'T SEE A THING ABOUT IT
SO IT'S UH WE'VE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO I GUESS IT'S IMPROVED AND LIKE I SAY WITH CNN AND AND UH THE CABLE NEWS EVEN EVEN THERE'S A UH
IT'S SOR- IT'S SEMIRELIGIOUS IN SOME RESPECTS BUT WHAT IS IT IT'S UH
I MEAN ITS NEWS IS NOT NOT THAT WAY UH OH I'M TRYING TO THINK OF THE CHANNEL THE CHR- THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR
UH I- IT SURPRISED ME I'VE CAUGHT IT A FEW TIMES AND THEY THEY DO SOME PRETTY GOOD NEWS UH SEEMINGLY UNBIASED NEWS BROADCASTS UH
UH THE THE TITLE OF THE NETWORK IS SORT OF SURPRISING YOU'D THINK IT WOULD CARRY MOSTLY RELIGIOUS BUT IT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SO I'LL FLIP THROUGH AND
LISTEN TO IT ONCE IN AWHILE TOO UH AND CATCH SOMETHING MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THAN CNN MIGHT BE COVERING
UH SOME MORE IN- INTEREST TYPE TOPICS IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES BUT IT'S KIND OF WORLD WORLD UH NETWORK TOO
SO UH DO YOU HAPPEN TO BE WORKING FOR A LARGE FIRM
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
UH I WORK FOR A FAIRLY LARGE COMPANY IT'S GOT EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE
AND UH WE DO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND
WE DON'T HAVE 4O- -1K PLAN STUFF LIKE THAT BUT WE DO HAVE LIKE
RETIREMENT THEY KIND OF MATCH UP TO YOU IF YOU PUT SIX PERCENT THEY MATCH UP TO SIX PERCENT AND THEN  THE REST IS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO PUT IN IF YOU WANT TO PUT MORE THAN THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THAT'S NOT BAD
GOD I DON'T KNOW  I'M SURE IT'S NOT TILL LIKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIRTY YEARS
YEAH
HUH WELL I GUESS WHAT WE HAVE IS LIKE A F- WHAT THEY CALL A FLEX BENEFITS PLAN WHERE YOU
YOU GET LIKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AND THEN YOU SPEND IT ON A CAFETERIA OF WHATEVER YOU WANT OR NEED OTHERWISE YOU CAN UH
GUESS YOU CAN PUT ALSO PUT MONEY HOLD MONEY BACK AND THEN
EITHER USE IT OR LOSE IT AND THAT DOESN'T GET TAXED OR YOU CAN JUST HAVE THAT MONEY
YOU KNOW PUT IN YOUR PAYCHECK
YEAH WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHICH COMPANY YOU WORK FOR I KNOW THAT LIKE THE THE THE ONE PLAN THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE IN IN MY PLACE IS UH
YOU KNOW YOU UH THINK YOU CALL IT PLAN D  DEDUCTIBLES ARE REALLY HIGH IT'S LIKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
BUT IF YOU GO FOR THE OTHER ONES YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S UNLIKELY IF YOU'RE F- RELATIVELY UH HEALTHY THEN IT'S REALLY UNLIKELY THAT YOU'RE GONNA USE THAT MU- AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU KNOW
SO THE IT YOU KNOW SOMEONE DID START A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND ENDS UP THE BEST IS THEY TAKE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE AND AND TAKE A LOSS WHAT- WHATEVER HAPPENS A BE IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL
UM
REALLY YOU MEAN NOT EVEN Y- DOUR YOUR CAR INSURANCE
OH THAT'S TOO BAD
YEAH UH WELL I DON'T KNOW I THINK OTHER THAN HEALTH INSURANCE I THINK UH YOU KNOW AN EXTRA WEEK OF UH  TIME OFF WOULD BE NICE I ONLY GET TWO WEEKS
OH THAT'S NICE WE DON'T GET THEM TILL TILL YOUR SEVENTH YEAR OF SERVICE TILL YOU GET AN EXTRA WEEK
YEAH IT'S UH
UH WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TYPE OF COMPANY SUPPOSEDLY YOU USE- IT USED TO BE MUCH MORE STABLE IT'S A LOT LESS STABLE THAN IT USED TO BE THEY USED TO HAVE JOB SECURITY AND CRAP
BUT NOW THEY DON'T
YEAH IT'S THE BELL CORPS WHICH IS UH
YEAH SO I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S UH NO LONGER  SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT'S STILL BASED ON THE OLD MODEL OF
AND AND NOW THEY DON'T UH
YEAH
YEAH BUT THE TH- N- NO LONGER  I DON'T THINK SO
UH HEARING A LO- THERE'S ALWAYS THEY'RE ALWAYS LAYING PEOPLE OFF WHICH IS ANOTHER BENEFIT
THAT YOU CAN HAVE OTHER THAN SALARY IS TRADE THAT OFF FOR SECURITY
AH I DON'T KNOW WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING LAYOFFS WE'VE BEEN DOING UH DOWN SIZING WITH UH GETTING RID OF EXTRA LAYERS OF MANAGEMENT AND UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO FOR THOSE PEOPLE
SOME OF IT YEAH THERE'S TOO MANY MAN- TOO MANY CHIEFS AND NOT ENOUGH INDIANS BUT
WELL IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE I GUESS THAT'S NOT LARGE COMPARED TO SOME BUT IT'S BIG ENOUGH
AND THEY HAVE A
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF PENSION PLAN WHERE THEY CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING AND I WISH THEY DID
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A 401K BUT I PUT ALL THE MONEY INTO IT
THEY DON'T ADD ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT YOU
UH-HUH
OH THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEAL
NOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO VEST
YEAH THE PLACE I WORK AT IS HEALTH INSURANCE IS KIND OF EXPENSIVE IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW HUNDRED BUCKS A A MONTH OR SOMETHING FOR A FAMILY
YEAH WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE USE IT OR LOSE IT PLANS TOO WHERE UH THEY'LL BASICALLY PAY FOR UH YOU KNOW CHILD CARE TYPE UH EXPENSES I CAN SEND IN A UH
CAN SEND IN A REQUEST FOR PAYMENT AND THEY'LL UH AND THEY'LL SEND ME YOU KNOW A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT THEY WITHHELD
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW IT'S UH IT SAVES A THIRD OFF ON TAXES OR SOMETHING
YEAH I GUESS UH ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW I- I HAD A SIMILAR HAD A SIMILAR HEALTH PLAN AND UH
ONE OF MY KIDS WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND AND I HAD WOUND UP HAVING TO PAY FOR YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF DOCTOR VISITS AND STUFF OUT OF MY POCKET BECAUSE OF
YOU KNOW NO NO INSURANCE POLICY HAPPENED TO COVER IT WHICH IS
ON THE UH
ON THE C- CAR INSURANCE AND THEN  YOU KNOW WE
JUST GOOFED UP THE MEDICAL INSURANCE AND THE CAR INSURANCE AND STUFF AND
OH WELL
YEAH YEAH MY PLACE YOU GET TWO WEEKS WHEN YOU START AND THEN EVERY EVERY YEAR THEY GIVE YOU AN EXTRA DAY UNTIL YOU'VE GOT FOUR WEEKS
AYE
THAT'S A LONG TIME
YEAH ESPECIALLY IN THE KIND OF ENGINEERING JOB I'M IN YOU KNOW COMPANIES DON'T STAY AFLOAT THAT LONG  AND AND THEY
SO YOU WORK FOR BELL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
RIGHT RIGHT
A LIFELONG JOB SECURITY TELEPHONE PIONEERS OF AMERICA ALL THAT STUFF HUH
RIGHT
OH D- IS IT I MEAN DOES IT THEY MUST HAVE PRETTY GOOD SEVERANCE THOUGH HUH
I MEAN THE THE THE MANAGEMENT THEY GET RID OF
UM
OH THEY THEY PUT
WELL ACTUALLY NOT BUT I'M ALL WAYS LOOKING AT THEM  YOU KNOW YOU YEAH YEAH IT UH
UH-HUH
HUM
YOU KNOW AM CONVINCE THAT UM IT'S ALWAYS CHEAPER TO REPAIR THAN REPLACE
AND UH YOU KNOW IF YOU REPLACE THERE ARE OTHER REASONS FOR DOING IT
LIKE YOU WANT YOU KNOW M- MY ANSWER TO A CAR IS IT'S OKAY IF IT UGLY UM IT OK- DEPENDING ON THE  THERE IS A THEY'RE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT OKAY THAT IT IS IT GOT TO BE RELIABLE THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT
YEAH YEAH
UM-HUM WELL SAFETY IS SUBJECTIVE I THINK UM YOU KNOW ONE PERSON CRITERIA OF SAFETY IS MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER PERSON
WELL THE YOU KNOW NOT RELIABLE COMPANY IT IT WILL NEVER START IN WHICH CASE EXTREMELY SAFE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN STARVE OR FREEZE TO DEATH IF YOUR CAR WANT START
UM FOR A WHILE I WAS A PROPONENT OF SAAB'S AND UM I HAVE HAD TWO OF THEM AND ONE WAS A TREMENDOUS ONE DISAPPOINTMENT FROM A RELIABILITY VIEW POINT
AND UM
BASICALLY I DECIDED TO GET RID OF IT BEFORE THE WARRANTY RAN OUT
AND I THINK I WAS CURED OF THE EUROPEAN MOTORING MYSTIC
AT THAT POINT
UM HAVE YOU OWN ONE OR
GUESS I'M
YOU KNOW IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE RELIABILITY IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT THE CAR WAS WONDERFUL DROVE GREAT TON OF ROOM VERY VERY SAFE BUT FRONT WHEEL DRIVE WHICH WITH ME A PLUS BUT I JUST KEPT HAVING UM STRING OF MINOR MALFUNCTIONS
AND UM JUST THE PROCESS OF HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE THING YOU KNOW ALSO NOW THEY INCREMENT IS WHAT HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EVERY TIME YOU TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC AND TOUCH IT HUNDRED DOLLARS HUNDRED DOLL- HUNDRED DOLLARS
YEAH ITS CAN OF FUNNY BECAUSE UM I WAS HAVING IT REPAIRED AT THIS PLACE CALLED IMPORT ONLY
AND UM THIS GUY'S COMMENT WAS
AND I ASKED HIM YOU KNOW YOU YOU REPAIR THEM ALL WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEST KIND OF RELIABILITY AND HE KIND OF GET A JAPANESE CAR
UM THAT STARTING TO FALL OUT OF FASHION THESE DAYS
UH
YEAH YOU KNOW I'M CONVINCE THAT WELL YOU IT KIND OF INTERESTING IS WHAT I'M DRIVING RIGHT NOW IS A FORD PROBE WHICH IS MANUFACTURED IN A MAZDA FACTORY IN ILLINOIS
SO I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S AN IMPORTER OR NOT
YEAH IT'S FAKE IT'S FAKE BECAUSE SEE I MEAN EVEN IF I I'M SURE THE UM
YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE THE MOST AMERICANIZED IN AMERICAN CARS AND YOU KNOW PRY OPEN ONE OF THOSE COMPUTER YOU WILL FIND A COMPUTER CHIP THAT WERE ASSEMBLE IN SINGAPORE
AND SO FORTH UH IT'S JUST DIFF- DIFFICULT
I MEAN IT'S GOT FUNNY  COMING ONCE JUST BEFORE AND UM
EQUAL THE ORANGE JUICE WAS LABEL CONCENTRATE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGH OF IT APPLE SAY ORA- APPLE APPLE JUICE AND TURKEY
VERY PROBABLY YOU KNOW ITS UM YEAH I THINK THE IDEAL OF UM YEAH ITS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LOCATION UM
DON'T SEEM TO UH YOU KNOW Y- YOU CAN WORK OVER SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF MILES NOT LIKE IT ONCE WAS
DOING IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE ANY MORE
AND SO
YEAH ABSOLUTELY UM YOU KNOW BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER BIGGER FACTORS SO IF YOU DECIDE TO REPLACE THIS TEN YEAR OLD VEHICLE WHAT IS THE PRIME CONTENDER RIGHT KNOW
YEAH I OWN ONE
YEAH
YEAH
UM WHICH KIND
UH-HUH
YEAH
UH YOU WOULD LIKE THE SAAB HAVE YOU DRIVEN ONE
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL I HAD HAD A NINE HUNDRED WHICH I REPLACED THE NINE THOUSAND NINE THOUSANDS IS THE ONE THAT GAVE ME A LOT OF TROUBLE
UM
I HAPPEN THE THINK THE NINE HUNDREDS IS A UH I LIKE THE NINE HUNDRED BETTER IT IT HAD MORE OF THE SAAB WEIRDNESS WHICH REALLY ATTRACTED ME
YEAH
SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CAR
YEAH I KNOW THAT FEELING
MINES ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD NOW SO DEBATING WEATHER TO RUN IT INTO THE GROUND
PUT UP WITH THOSE HEADACHE OR GET SOMETHING NEW
RIGHT THAT'S NUMBER ONE WELL THAT AND SAFETY
SAFE AND RELIABLE
WELL I THINK YEAH THAT'S TRUE BUT RELIABI- YOU KNOW IF IT'S NOT RELIABLE IT'S NOT SAFE
WELL MAY BE NOT IF YOU'RE ON THE TRANS ALASKA HIGHWAY
UH
WELL THE SAAB DOES HAVE A LOT OF GOOD FEATURES AND THE RELIABILITY IS UH LIKE ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I WORRY ABOUT WITH SAAB
NO I HAVEN'T BUT UH YOU KNOW LO- YOU KNOW LOOKING AROUND IT DOES SEEM LIKE A ROOMY
GOOD HANDLING
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
OH YEAH
WELL THAT'S
YEAH THAT'S THE OTHER DRAWBACK OF SAAB IS THAT THEY ARE NOT REALLY CHEAP
OH YEAH A LOT OF UH FLAG WAVING GOING ON
WELL THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM IF YOUR CONCERNED WITH THAT I DON'T THINK ITS POSSIBLE TO TELL WHERE THINGS ARE BUILT ANYONE
OH YEAH YOU KNOW
YEAH ITS PROBABLY OWN BY A EUROPEAN COU- COMPANY THAT'S EMPLOYING MEXICANS
Y- YOU KNOW
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE A
OH WELL TRANSPORTATION DOES STILL COST
WELL UH I WAS I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF THE SAAB NINE THOUSANDS
BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW OTHER HATCHBACKS
NO WELL I HAVE IT A TOYOTA AND I LIKE THE TOYOTA'S
IT'S A A SUPRA
SO IT HANDLES REALLY WELL SO I'M RELUCTANT TO GET ANYTHING THAT HANDLES POORLY
UM I DROVE A NINE HUNDRED ABOUT FIVE Y- YEARS AGO
IT WAS VERY NICE
UH
YES UH I DON'T MIND UGLY
YEAH I- I AGREE WITH YOU THERE
THE METRIC SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD I'M UM I'M UM
DO DRAFTING I'M I'M A ENGINEER AND I'VE DONE DRAWING AND AND HAVE TO DO CALCULATION OF FLUID MECHANICS AND THING
AND IF YOU EVER HAVE TO TRY TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT CONVERSIONS TO TO TO TRY AND ALL  FOUR DIFFERENT TYPE OF SYSTEM WITH GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT
AND IT IT JUST GOES IT JUST GOES ON AND ON
-NOTHER TH- THING IS THAT WHEN DOING YOUR DRAWING YOU CAN SCALE THEM SO MUCH EASIER THING BECAUSE THEIR INCREMENT OF TEN'S SO MUCH EASIER
I MEAN YOUR YOUR LIFE IS JUST UH SO MUCH EASIER I
I REALLY THINK THAT WHAT CAN BE DONE DIFFERENTLY
IS THAT IT'S IT'S TO INGRAIN IN OUR SOCIETY TO SHIFT IT ALL OUR PROTOTYPE ALL OUR OUR MODE OUR TEMPLATE  OUR BOLTS OUR THREADS EVERYTHING
THE TOOLING THE TOOLING IS IS SO IS SO UH IN IN OUR SYSTEM THAT IT JUST IT IT JUST GOING TO TAKE A LOT TO MOVE IT AWAY
WELL MOST OF THEM HAVE THE MATRIX SET NOW BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S UH I THINK IT'S MORE IN THE THE THE THE BOLTS AND THREADS AND STUFF IT SELF I MEAN THE
THE SCREW MACHINE AND STUFF THAT MAKES ALL THOSE THING THEY'RE JUST THEY COST MILLIONS OF YOU KNOW THOU- HUNDRED OF THOUSAND'S OF DOLLARS AND THING AND THAT'S
AND I GUESS MAYBE THEY COULD BE RE- SOME OF THEM COULD BE RESENTED BUT THE COMP- THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT I THINK WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THAT IN THE LONG RUN THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH EASIER
OH EXACTLY ALSO THE TRADE YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT
YEAH IT'S UH WE NEED TO DO THAT
AND UH AS I SAID THE THE MAIN THING YOU KNOW LIKE JUST IN THE CALCULATION TH- TH-
EXACTLY
IN WHAT
OH OKAY I KNOW WHAT THAT IS YEAH
YEAH IT'S IT'S
YOU KNOW AND THEN THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPANY HAS THEIR OWN SET OF GUIDELINES THEY THEY THEY USE
BUT WE OUR  OUR SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATE IN THE GLOBAL IN IN THE WORLD
AND THE ECONOMIC SEEM THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE
COMPATIBLE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE WE STARTED OUT WITH THE COMPUTERS
AND WE'VE WE'VE HAD TO FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL JUST TO GET THEM TO BE SOME WHAT COMPATIBLE AND THEY'RE ALL JUST GOING OFF AND ALL DIF- ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
AND I GUESS ONE OF THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE GOAL ISN'T TO PRO- PRO-
-DUCE THE TECHNOLOGY THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE THE BUCK THE THE ALL MIGHTY DOLLAR IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT JUST IT IT JUST CONTROL OUR DESTINY
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I GUESS
SO YOU JUST
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S TRUE
I REALLY  LIKE FIRST THOUGHT I CAN'T REALLY THINK OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENT HAS TO DO WITH UH
SO I THINK THE MATRIX SYSTEM
WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING FOR THE UNITED STATES AND FOR UM UNITED STATES BEING ABLE TO TRADE MORE EASY WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
AS THE WORLD ECONOMY BECOME  MUCH MORE GLOBAL
JUST HAVING A STANDARD SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT ESPECIALLY ONE THAT EASY TO CALCULATE WHERE G NOT BECOME ONE AND ALL KINDS OF NICE STUFF LIKE THAT IS
JUST A WONDERFUL ADVANTAGE
OH RIGHT YEAH SO YOU GET
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
I REM-
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT THE TOOLS ARE THAT'S THE EXPENSIVE THING
THAT RIGHT IF YOU THINK THAT EVERY GAR- CORNER GARAGE HAS TO BUY A WHOLE NEW SET OF TOOLS
RIGHT BUT NOT ONLY WILL THEIR LIFE WOULD BE EA- EASIER BUT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE MONEY SELLING THINGS ABROAD
I KNOW I MOST CALCULATION I REMEMBER WHEN I TOOK FLUID MECHANICS AND
I THE PROFESSOR WAS TELLING US HOW HE WANTED US TO GIVE THE ANSWER AND I WAS HE SAID HE WANTED THEM THE ANSWER IN THE ENGLISH SYSTEM BECAUSE THE ENGINEERS NEEDED TO KNOW HOW TO USE THE ENGLISH SYSTEM
I- I TREAT TO GIVE MY ANSWER IN TOUNDAR
TOUNDAR WHICH IS A UM TOUNDAR T O U N D A R
SO HE HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT VERY MUCH
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL THERE'S ALWAYS THE CONFLICT BETWEEN INNOVATION AND STANDARDIZATION
AND THEY'RE IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE TRUE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGE ADVANCE THING AND THE THING THAT HAS THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR ANY GIVEN
APPLICATION ARE GOING TO BE NON STANDARD
BUT
FOR THE GENERAL EVERYDAY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT
THE STANDARDIZATION IS SUCH AN ADVANTAGE
SO AND SOMETHING LIKE WHAT SIDE OF THE ROAD YOU DRIVE ON
I GUESS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THAT HAD TO BE WORKED OUT
AND
BEFORE VERY MANY PEOPLE WERE DRIVING IT WASN'T A PROBLEM
O- O- OKAY I'M UH
WELL I DO WORK FOR A LARGE COMPANY UH LARGE MEANING ABOUT TW- UH TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
AND UH IT USE TO BE TWICE AS BIG SO
COULD'VE BEEN UH COULD'VE BEEN BETTER I'LL PUT IT THIS WAY WHEN I CAME TO WORK HERE IT WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND NOW IT'S TWELVE THOUSAND AND DROPPING
BUT UH THE ADVANTAGES OF A  H- HOW BIG IS THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR
OKAY LESS THEN A HUNDRED
SOME OF THE SAME THING STILL APPLIES I'VE WORK FOR COMPANY'S UH YOUR SIZE BEFORE
AND SOME OF THE SAME THING STILL APPLIES THOUGH UH ONE OF THE THINGS IS
LIKE I KNOW A GUY WHO'S GONE TO WORK FOR HIMSELF
AND
AND UH AFTER A WHILE HE BECAME
ISOLATED
YEAH HE WAS HE CRAVED UH  YEAH
AND UH THAT'S ONE OF THE NICE THING A ABOUT A COMPANY UH INTERACTION WITH OTHER PEOPLE ACCESS TO INTERNET UH
DO YOU HAVE INTERNET HOW DID YOU GET HOOKED UP TO THIS
SO THINGS LIKE THAT THE INTERNET UH ACCESS INTERNET ACCESS TO A LIBRARY
UM
GEE HOW DO I SAY IT UH
UH-HUH
THE
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGE OF UH OF A UH LARGER COMPANY AND THE HUNDRED IS UH COULD BE CONSIDER A LARGER COMPANY IS
IS UH ACCESS TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT DO THE SAME THING
IF YOU'RE THE ONLY COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN YOUR COMPANY THEN IT'S IT'S IT IS KIND OF ISOLATED
AND UH
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES UH THERE ARE LOTS OF DISADVANTAGES OF COURSE BUT UH
YES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT UH TENDS TO HAPPEN
I- IN A LARGER COMPANY IS UH
OH HOW DO I SAY IT UH LACK OF ACCESS TO UH
TO PEOPLE UH THEY THEY TEND TO DEPARTMENTALIZE AND AND UH MOVE AWAY WHERE AS IN A COMPANY YOUR SIZE
UH LET SEE A HUNDRED OR SO I- I IN THE PAST UH HAD ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO HAD ACCESS TO JUST ANYTHING ANYTH- ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WAS UH WAS AVAILABLE
WHERE AS IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS IT'S VERY FRAGMENTED
AND I'M I MIGHT BE
YEAH AND SO WELL I CAN BE TEN FEET AWAY FROM SOMEBODY THAT IS DOING THE SAME THING
I- I HAVE ONE FEAR HERE I I DON'T KNOW IF I PUSH THE ONE BUTTON LONG ENOUGH
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HEAR THAT HUH OKAY BECAUSE I
WELL IN THE PAST THEY'VE IT YOU KNOW THEY SEEM TO SHUT US OFF FAIRLY QUICKLY SO I- I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT LET ME TRY IT ONCE MORE HERE
OKAY
OKAY
THAT'S BIG
UH-HUH
UH LESS THEN A HUNDRED PEOPLE
UH-HUH
INTERACTION YEAH
UH WELL I HAVE AN INTERNET UH THROUGH ANOTHER I HAVE ANOTHER INTERNET CONNECTION THROUGH ANOTHER NETWORK BUT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
ESTABLISHING OUR OWN INTERNET FEE- INTERNET FEED
UM
YEAH
WELL I THINK THE DIVERSITY OF A LARGE COMPANY IS A STRONG THING FOR IT UM THE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT UH WORKING FOR A COMPANY COULD TAKE YOU A A LARGE COMPANY UM
GRANTED IF YOUR S- YOUR SKILLS WERE LIKE NUCLEAR PHYSICS SO YOU PRETTY MUCH NARROW T- TO UH
YOUR CHOICES ARE NARROWED BUT
I CAN SEE SOMEONE WITH ON DOING WHAT I DO GOING INTO MANY DIFFERENT SORT OF VENUE I GUESS YOU'D CALL THEM IN A LARGER COMPANY
UM
I'M A SYSTEMS ENGINEER AND I BASICALLY
DESIGN NETWORKS UM
SO FOR OUR END USERS AND OUR CUSTOMER I'M YOU KNOW UH
I'M PRETTY MUCH LIMITED TO THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I DO
UM-HUM
YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES IS THE BUREAUCRACY THAT PROPS UP AS A YOU KNOW NECESSITY FOR ALMOST ANY- GETTING ANYTHING DONE AT ALL YOU HAVE TO
UH
MANY LAYERS TO GO THROUGH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM AND YOU HAVE THE TYPICAL PYRAMID STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATION MANY WORK GROUPS ONE MAN ON TOP OR WOMAN UM AND MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS RIGHT
UH-HUH
WE ARE STRUCTURED IN THE UH
IN UH IN UH BUBBLE
UH STRUCTURE
WE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS HOWEVER WE WORK TOGETHER
UM THAT'S BY DESIGN WE'VE HAD THE SAME STRUCTURE FOR BASICALLY FOR TWENTY YEARS
AND UH IT ALLOWS US TO DO MANY INTERESTING THING WE HAVE MANY FACET TO OUR ORGANIZATION
UH AND WE ARE ABLE TO MIX AND MATCH AND BRING DIFFERENT FACETS INTO PLAY AS THEY'RE NEEDED SO WE WE BASICALLY COVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF COMPUTING UH FOR OUR FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND UH
I THINK YOU DID
YEAH
I HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T SAID THAT WE'RE OUT OF SPACE YET MAYBE THEY DELETED THEIR TEMP DIRECTORY
YEAH
WELL UM YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK AS LONG AS WE LIKE OR UNTIL THEY TELL US I'VE USUALLY HIT THE MARKER TO
UM WE'RE NOT SUPPOSE TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS ANYWAY UH
SO WE'RE  WE'RE IN A WE'RE IN A BUBBLE DIAGRAM AND UH
THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY EFFECTIVE AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY NINETIES KIND OF THING LIKE I SAY WE'VE HAD IT FOR TWENTY SOMETHING YEARS AND SO WE ARE REALLY GOOD AT IT BUT UH
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE THE BENEFITS OF TI
OH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
YEAH THA- THAT'S ONE PROBLEM WITH UH ENGINEERING JOBS IS
IT'S YOU YOU REALLY NEED SOME SORT OF MORE FLEXIBLE OR PORTABLE PENSION YOU KNOW SOMETHING MORE LIKE A
EITHER 40- WELL I GUESS YOU GET PART OF INTO 401K ONE OH 401K
BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE UH KEY HEAL- PLAN THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PRIVATELY EMPLOYED USE
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
WHAT ALSO SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF COMPANY SET THE BENEFITS BASED ON
YOUR LAST SALARY WHEN YOU LEFT THE COMPANY
SO YOU KNOW LET'S SAY YOU'VE WORKED THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS
YOU STOPPED WORKING THERE YOU GO WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND BECAUSE OF INFLATION ALONE
UM YOU KNOW YOUR TWENTY YEARS IS WORTHLESS JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT AN INDEX TO FUND IT'S BASED ON THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF WHEN YOU WORKED THERE
YEAH
I- BE- BENEFITS IN GENERAL
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S ONE THING YOU DO GET WITH A LARGE COMPANY THEY'RE
YOU KNOW IT'S WELL IT'S ACTUALLY CAN GO BOTH WAYS SOMETH- SOME WAYS YOU HAVE
MORE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THERE'RE SO MANY THINGS GOING ON WITHIN THE COMPANY
BUT YOU ALSO MAY GET KEY HOLED AND YOU ARE A EX TYPE PERSON THEREFORE YOU SHOULD ONLY WORK ON THIS TYPE PROJECT
AND THAT I GUESS TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE COMPANY AND WHETHER THEY PIGEON HOLE PEOPLE OR ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO IN T- TO ANY AREA THEY WANT TO
YEAH THE- THERE WAS SOME CLICKING ON THE LINE I'M NOT SURE WHAT
WHETHER THAT'S LOCAL OR SOMEWHERE IN THE LONG DISTANCE NETWORK BETWEEN
NEW JERSEY AND WHEREVER YOU ARE
CALIFORNIA OKAY
THIS IS ALSO POSSIBLE
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEXAS
UM-HUM
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU GO IF YOU GO UP UH FAR ENOUGH NORTH IT DOESN'T
IT GETS CHEAPER AGAIN BUT THEN AGAIN THERE'S Y- Y-
UM-HUM
YEAH I KNOW NEW JERSEY IS
JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WHICH WAS YEAH IT'S ABOUT TWICE THE PRICE OF ATLANTA
BUT UH THE HOU- THE HOUSING PRICES HAVE DEFINITELY DROPPED
YEAH CO- COST OF LIVING COST OF HOUSING IS THE SALARY ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO DO THE ACTIVITIES I WANT TO DO
YES
UM WELL ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH UH NOT VERY WELL I RESIGNED FROM TEXAS INSTRUMENTS NOT SHORTLY
AGO AND FOUND THAT MY UH AFTER HAVING WORKED THERE FOR
TWENTY ONE YEARS
MY VESTED INTEREST IN MY
PENSION FUND WAS AMOUNTED TO LESS THAN THREE QUARTERS OF A YEAR OF SALARY
UM I DON'T KNOW UH TH- THE UH I G- I GUESS THE TH- THAT ISSUE WAS A TI RETIREMENT UH BENEFIT IS IT IS WHAT THEY CALL A DEFINED A DEFINED BENEFITS PROGRAM WHICH MEANS IF YOU RETIRE YOU GET BENEFITS
UM
IF YOU DON'T RETIRE YOU GET SHIT
UH BUT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SORT OF PASSED SOME KIND OF LEGISLATION SOME LONG TIME AGO THAT SAID WELL YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN'T JUST KISS THEM OFF IF THEY DON'T RETIRE
AND SO THERE'S SOME NOMINAL UH
A- AMOUNT THAT HAS TO BE VESTED WITH THE EMPLOYEE
BUT UH IN THIS MODERN DAY AND AGE WHERE THERE IS JOB MOBILITY I MEAN
UH IT'S TIME FOR EMPLOYERS TO STOP SCREWING THE EMPLOYEES OUT OF THEIR RETIREMENT BENEFITS BY
INVOKING THIS UH DEFINED BENEFITS PLAN
RIGHT
RIGHT
WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON I THINK THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER HIS PENSION ACCOUNT
UM OF COURSE THE INITIAL QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED RELATED TO UH ACTUALLY I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYMORE BUT TO
IT RELATED TO WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A POSITION OTHER THAN SALARY AND I GUESS MY MIND BEFORE IT REFERRED TO BENEFITS MY MIND WAS NOT THINKING A LONG THE WITH THE I- LINES OF BENEFITS AT ALL BUT RATHER
UM
CAREER G- GRATIFICATION AND YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
BOY I TH- THERE WERE SOME SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOUR S- YOUR SIGNAL AT THAT POINT DID YOU NOTICE IT
YEAH
IN CALIFORNIA
OR WHETHER IT'S PART OF THE UH SWITCHBOARD SYSTEM
YEAH
WELL  PARTY OF M- PART OF MY REASON FOR COMING TO CALIFORNIA WAS CALIFORNIA
UH IT IS IT I LOVE IT IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE BUT THE THE PRICE OF HOUSING IS
IS JUST TOTALLY
LOONEY
WELL THAT'S TRUE UP IN REDDING UH TH- HOUSING PRICES ARE PROBABLY COMPARABLE TO DALLAS WHERE I CAME FROM BUT DOWN HERE THE HOUSING PRICES ARE
ABOUT A FACTOR OF FIVE HIGHER WHICH IS REALLY RIDICULOUS
AT ANY RATE
SO I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LOOK FOR IN A JOB UH IS UM
AFFORDABLE COST OF LIVING
OF COURSE THE MOST WONDERFUL THING FOR THE COMPANY AND THE MOST WONDERFUL THING FOR THE EMPLOYEE TOO IS IF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO WORK
NOT SO GREAT FOR THE FAMILY BUT UH
OKAY UM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UH TRIAL BY JURY AND WHETHER OR NOT WE THOUGHT IT WAS A A FAIR WAY TO DO IT DO YOU THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE UH THE JUDGE DO THE SENTENCING TO TRY TO MAKE IT MORE UNIFORM OR MORE FAIR OR OR WHAT DO YOU THINK
WELL THERE THERE IS AN ARGUMENT IN THAT UH A JUDGE HAS SEEN A LOT MORE CASES AND YOU KNOW PERHAPS HE SEES ONE CRIME
AND AND HE CAN COMPARE THAT CRIME TO YOU KNOW HIS LONG HISTORY OF OF OF DEALING WITH WITH CRIMINALS AND UH
THE THE JURY YOU KNOW THIS IS YOU KN- MAYBE THEY'VE SAT ON SAT ON A JURY ONCE BEFORE MAYBE THIS IS THEIR VERY FIRST TIME THE ONLY THEY'VE REALLY SEEN IS LIKE GAUDY ON TV OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND AND THEY JUST YOU KNOW THEY JUST KIND OF
YOU KNOW MAKING GUESSES HOW BAD THEY THINK IT IS
YEAH YEAH AS AS UNIFORMED A- I MEAN HE WOULD HE WOULD
FIGURE OUT THE SEVERITY BASED UPON HIS OWN PERSONAL SCALE THE ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT IS LIKE ONE
UM ONE MURDERER OR OR LET'S SAY ONE ONE THIEF
UM GETTING LIKE
A TENTH OF THE PENALTY OF OF ANOTHER THIEF SIMPLY BECAUSE PERHAPS HE IMPRESSED THE JURY MORE OR OR YOU KNOW JUST BE- BECAUSE HIS PRESENTATION WAS BETTER
YEAH
EXACTLY
SEE I WOULD ALMOST ARGUE I WOULD CONSIDER I I I DON'T UNDER- I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THOUGHT IT OUT LONG ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS BUT GETTING RID OF THE ENTIRE TRIAL BY JURY AND AND HAVING THE JUDGE DECIDE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY
OH  OH MAN
UH
YEAH BUT I THINK THE THE WE THE PEOPLE THAT THAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE TALKING ABOUT WERE RICH WHITE MALES
I MEAN I DON'T THINK
I- I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A REAL HIGH OPINION OF OF THE MASSES I MEAN HAMILTON WAS WAS A PRIME CASE YOU KNOW HE HE DIDN'T I THINK HE REFERRED TO THEM AS THE MINDLESS MASSE- HE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO VOTE HE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO HAVE ANY SAY IN GOVERNMENT
RIGHT
YOU KNOW THAT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
WELL I MEAN ONLY ONE SEN- IT SEEMS LIKE A NEEDLESS STEP BUT I THINK THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE PERSON WHO HAVEN'T VOTED AS HE WAS VOTED INTO OR THERE'S ONLY I THINK ONLY BEEN ONE ELECTORAL VOTE THAT WAS N- NOT VOTED AT IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
AS THE PROPULAR A- THE POPULAR VOTE WAS VOTED
SO
UH
WELL UM
I THINK THAT UH WHEN YOU'RE TRIED BY A JURY OF YOUR PEERS THEY PROBABLY UH THE COLLECTIVE
MIND OF THE JURY IS PROBABLY A BETTER VEHICLE FOR SENTENCING THAN THE JUDGE HIMSELF UH BECAUSE THEN THERE'S THE CONSENSUS THING RATHER THAN A UH A SINGLE PERSON
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH WELL I WOULD I C- I WOULD ARGUE BACK THAT UH
A A SINGLE PERSON BEING ABLE TO PASS A SENTENCE ON SOMEONE UM LEAVES IT OPEN TO HIS OR HER OWN UH BIASES AND THEY MAY CONSIDER
ARSON TO BE A HEINOUS CRIME AND CHILD MOLESTATION TO BE LESS SEVERE SO THE SENTENCE WOULDN'T BE ALL THAT UNIFORMED I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE UNIFORM WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THAT JUDGE HIM- HIM OR HERSELF
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST UH BIGGEST PROBLEMS I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY IS THAT UH THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
UH BASICALLY GOES BY WHO'S GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE BEST LAWYER AND UH THE PRESENTATION IS IS EVERYTHING UM SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU COULD HAVE A REAL DIRT BALL
BE PORTRAYED BY HIS LAWYER AS A LOVING FAMILY MAN AND AND UH COLOR THE COLOR THE JURY'S OPINIONS BUT UM I DON'T KNOW
WELL WE COULD DO THAT OR WE COULD EXPLODE IT TO IT'S LOGICAL EXTREME OR IT'S OR
RIDICULOUS EXTREME AND
TAKE UH THE NEW INTERACTIVE TELEVISION UH
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COMING FORWARD AND UH HAVE EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY OR EVERYONE WHO CHOSE TO TUNE IN
DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE AND THEN UH HAVE A SLIDING SCALE OF YOU KNOW THE FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SAID YOU WERE GUILTY THAT MEANS YOU GET THE LIFE IN PRISON YOU KNOW UM
WHEEL OF JUSTICE WE COULD HAVE A GAME SHOW YOU KNOW WE NO THERE THERE I- IT DOES NEED REFORM UH I WOULD WORRY ABOUT A SINGLE JUDGE UH
PASSING SENTENCE UH ESPECIALLY I- IN A MORE INVOLVED TRIAL UH
I I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAD A GREAT IDEA AND TH- R- THE REASON THAT WE WENT AWAY FROM THE SINGLE JUDGE OR THE THE THE TRIAD I GUESS OF JUDGES THAT THEY HAVE UH IN SOME SYSTEMS IT JUST UM
YOU KNOW THEY BECOME INSTRUMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND
UM-HUM
OH YEAH THAT'S WHY THEY UH MADE ELECTION DAYS ON TUESDAY IN NOVEMBER YOU KNOW TUESDAY WAS A WORK DAY AND NOVEMBER WAS A REAL PAIN TO TRAVEL IN NOVEMBER BACK IN WHAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE UM
SO I YOU KNOW THEY SORT OF ARRANGED IT SO THAT A- YOU KNOW AND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS ALL RIGGED ANYWAY I MEAN IN THEORY THEY HAVE TO VOTE FOR  IT'S YOU KNOW I- THEY DON'T HAVE TO UM
UM-HUM
UM UM
NO NO I DON'T
UH DO YOU
UM-HUM
ARE THEY ARE THEY IN ANY SORT OF CHILD CARE
UM-HUM UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT

UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT RIGHT
UM-HUM
OH REALLY
WOW
OH OKAY I SEE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH RIGHT

UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM-HUM

RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM
RIGH-
RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM YEAH MY MY FATHER'S GIRLFRIEND UM
SHE'S SHE'S A LAWYER AND SO SHE WORKS YOU KNOW EVERYDAY NINE TO FIVE AND UH SHE KEEPS REALLY LONG HOURS AT THE OFFICE AND UH
SHE'S GOT A LITTLE TWO YEAR OLD BOY AND SHE NOW HAS A LIVE IN
SO CHILD CARE DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN
UH-HUH
YEAH WE HAVE TWO WE HAVE UH A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A TWO YEAR OLD AT LEAST THEY WILL BE IN APRIL I'M GETTING USED TO CALLING THEM THAT SINCE THEY'RE ALL PREPARED FOR THEIR BIRTHDAYS
UH YES AND NO UH AND MY F- UH THREE ALMOST FOUR YEAR OLD IS BEEN IN A PRESCHOOL HALF A DAY UH SINCE SEPTEMBER IT'S A MONTESSORI SCHOOL
AND IN A SENSE THAT'S A DAY CARE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T USE IT FOR DAY CARE WE CHOSE IT BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATIONAL FEATURES OF THE SCHOOL
UH PRIOR TO THAT WE HAD A WOMAN COME OVER UH ONE OR TWO AFTERNOONS A WEEK
AND UH PROVIDE IN HOME DAY CARE UH MORE OR LESS TO GIVE MY WIFE YOU KNOW A BREAK IN THE AFTERNOONS TO UH GO OUT AND RUN ERRANDS AND DO THINGS
UM BUT CARE FOR US THE THE PROBLEMATIC TIME IS IN THE EVENING UH JUST FINDING BABYSITTERS BECAUSE OF THE AGES WE DON'T REALLY
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T TRUST BUT WE JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH UH  UH YOUNGER KIDS UH EARLY TEENS
UH WE'VE BEEN PRETTY FORTUNATE WE'VE HAD BABYSITTERS THAT TEND TO BE IN THEIR LATE TEENS THEY DRIVE OVER IN THEIR OWN CARS
UH THE OLDER WOMAN WHO WATCHES THE THE KIDS DURING THE DAY SOMETIMES COMES OVER IN THE EVENING  SO
I I'VE BEEN SAVED I'VE ONLY HAD TO TAKE BABYSITTERS HOME TWICE I GUESS WHICH ISN'T BAD BUT WE HAVE UH
A- ALL OF OUR FAMILIES LIVES IN SAINT LOUIS SO THE NORMAL FAMILY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT UH A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE JUST ISN'T THERE FOR US
WE DON'T HAVE UH I MEAN  MY MY WIFE HAS A YOUNGER SISTER WHO'S TEN YEARS YOUNGER BUT HAS CHILDREN THE SAME AGE AS
AND WE WERE ASKING DENISE ONE TIME WELL HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY FOR BABYSITTERS SHE GOES I DON'T KNOW I'VE ONLY PAID ONE ONCE
YEAH AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW AFTER THREE YEARS BUT SHE JUST HAS IN-LAWS AND SIBLINGS AND
UH YOU KNOW PARENTS THAT THAT WATCH AND NEIGHBORS SHE LIVES IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS A LOT OF UH YOUNG FAMILIES AND OUR NEIGHBORS SEEM TO BE MOSTLY RETIRED
PLUS IT'S HARDER TO TO IMPOSE ON UH YOU KNOW NEIGH- UH THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE KIDS BUT IT'S IT FEELS DIFFICULT TO IMPOSE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE KIDS THEMSELVES
DO YOU EVER DO ANY BABYSITTING YOURSELF
UM-HUM IT'S A IT'S A GREAT JOB
UH YOU KNOW FOR THE MOST PART UH ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW IN OUR HOUSE IT'S
IT'S CLEAN AND NEAT AND THE REFRIGERATOR'S STOCKED AND MOST THE TIME WHEN THEY COME OVER IN THE EVENING IT'S YOU KNOW AN HOURS WORTH OF OF REAL CARE AND THEN THE REST IS JUST TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR SLEEPING CHILDREN
WE DID HAVE UH ONE OCCURRENCE THAT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING WE HAD TWO WOMEN THAT CAME
ALTERNATIVELY UH WHEN OUR DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT ONE YEAR OLD AND UH
IT WASN'T A PROBLEM SITUATION BUT IT WAS ONE THAT JUST MADE MY WIFE SOMEWHAT NERVOUS THE WOMAN WASN'T QUITE TOGETHER SHE WAS EASILY DISTRACTED
SHE WAS NICE ENOUGH THE KIDS UH YOU KNOW MY MY DAUGHTER LIKED HER BUT WE ENDED UP UH CHOOSING NOT TO TO HAVE HER ON A REGULAR BASIS MAKING A CONSCIOUS DECISION AND
IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR US SHE WAS DEPENDABLE IN IN THAT SHE WOULD SHOW UP BUT WE JUST DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AND WE SEE OUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE KIDS THE SAME AGE MAKING MORE EASY DECISIONS UH
MEANING THAT UH THEY'RE THEY SEEM TO BE PRETTY LAX IN IN WHO COMES IN AND WHO WATCHES THEM
WE HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A LARGE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE UH THREE KIDS UNDER FOUR YEARS OLD THEY HAVE TWINS AND THEY'RE IN
THEY HAVE A LIVE-IN HOUSEKEEPER AND IT JUST ISN'T A PERSON THAT WE WOULD HAVE EVEN TO OUR HOME ON A A REGULAR BASIS MUCH LESS ON A
UH LIVE-IN BASIS JUST DIFFERENT VALUE SYSTEMS AND UH DIFFERENT
DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS CHILD REARING
UM-HUM
I THINK I'M PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND A FIVE ON THE SCALE THEY GAVE UH
UM I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW ANYONE BEING ABLE TO JUST SORT OF GO UP TO A STORE AND BUY A HAND GUN FOR ABOUT UH YOU KNOW FORTY DOLLARS OR WHATEVER AND GO OUT AND SHOOT SOMEONE
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT UH HUNTING IS A LEGITIMATE USE FOR WEAPONS AND UH I ALSO SORT OF BELIEVE THAT
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW CERTAINLY OUR GOVERNMENT IS IS VERY NICE NOW I- IT PROBABLY DOESN'T HURT THIS SORT OF ULTIMATE BACK UP TO HAVE SOME SO- CITIZENS TO HAVE GUNS IF FOR SOME REASON
SOMETHING EVER HAPPENED AND OUR GOVERNMENT WAS RUN BY SOMEONE WHO DECIDED TO MAKE IT NON DEMOCRATIC WELL THAT'S A VERY FARFETCHED AND YOU KNOW SORT OF
YOU KNOW PARANOID IF YOU WILL POSSIBILITY BUT YOU KNOW IT I GUESS IT'S IT'S
I THINK IT'S I- ALWAYS SORT OF A BAD IDEA WHEN THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE GUNS ARE THE MILITARY AND THE POLICE SINCE
YEAH I MEAN I I
YEAH I AGREE COMPLETELY THERE SHOULD BE A WAITING PERIOD AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO A BACKGROUND CHECK ON YOU
YEAH I MEAN MOST
YEAH I AGREE COMPLETELY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A REASONABLE
YEAH UH I DON'T THINK SO
YOU NEED A PERMIT TO CARRY A CONCEALED HANDGUN I THINK IN SOME STATES I THINK TEXAS MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE BUT TO JUST CARRY YOU KNOW ONE IN THE OPEN OR WHATEVER IS NO PROBLEM
UM YEAH ALTHOUGH I UH ONE THING IS I THINK NO MATTER WHAT RULES YOU SET UNLESS YOU SORT OF HAD UH GOOD ENFORCEMENT OF IT IT WOULDN'T MATTER I MEAN THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT CAUSE TROUBLE WITH HANDGUNS AREN'T THE SORT TO CARE WHAT THE LAW IS ANYWAY
UM AND I'M SURE THEY WOULD CERTAINLY ATTEMPT TO BUY THEM ON THE BLACK MARKET SO YOU'D NEED UH YOU KNOW A GOOD METHOD OF ENSURING THAT THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE THERE WHICH
GIVEN THE SUCCESS OR RATHER LACK THERE OF OF THE POLICE IN CONTROLLING THE MARKET IN DRUGS I SORT OF WONDER UH YOU KNOW REALLY HOW EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE BUT I DON'T I DON'T MEAN THAT
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN I DON'T MEAN IT AS AN ARGUMENT TO NOT HAVE WAITING PERIODS AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT I JUST YOU KNOW I JUST I THINK IT'S
SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE THE THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION THAT WOULD SOLVE ALL CRIME PROBLEMS
UM YEAH
UH DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF
YOU KNOW REAL REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE WITH UH YOU KNOW EITHER PEOPLE OWNING GUNS OR PEOPLE BEING UH YOU KNOW ASSAULTED WITH UH GUNS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MY DAD HUNTED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T UM
BY THE TIME I CAME ALONG SO WE D- WE DIDN'T HAVE GUNS IN IN OUR HOUSE HE LEFT THEM AT UH HIS PARENTS HOUSE SO YOU KNOW I GOT TO SEE THEM OR WHATEVER
BUT UH I DO UH UH ANOTHER STUDENT WHO I DIDN'T KNOW PERSONALLY
AT RICE UH BUT UH IT'S NOT THAT S- THAT UH  LARGE A COMMUNITY UH ABOUT A WEEK AGO
UH WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A GUN  YEAH UM HE WAS YOU KNOW GOING HOME SORT OF LATE AT NIGHT AFTER STUDYING AND UH
YOU KNOW ROBBERS SAID YOU KNOW I GUESS HE WAS ON A MOTORCYCLE AND HE HAD A HIS MOTORCYCLE HELMET ON WHICH SAVED HIS LIFE UM BECAUSE
THEY SAID YOU KNOW WE WANT YOUR MONEY YOU KNOW WE HAVE GUN OR WHATEVER SO HE WAS LIKE OKAY HERE HAVE MY MONEY YOU KNOW I'LL LIE ON THE GROUND I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY I'LL I'M NOT GOING TO PUT UP ANY FIGHT WHATSOEVER
AND UH APPARENTLY THERE WERE TWO GUYS AND ONE OF THEM WAS REALLY KIND OF JUMPY AND THE OTHER SEEMED KIND OF UH RELAXED SO HE SAID TO THE RELAXED GUY HEY YOU KNOW PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIEND NOT TO SHOOT ME YOU KNOW BUT UH APPARENTLY THE OTHER GUY FOR WHATEVER REASON UH SHOT HIM ANYWAY
AND UH
THANKS TO THE FACT HI- HIS MOTORCYCLE HELMET WAS MADE OUT OF KEVLAR WHICH IS THE SAME THING THAT BULLET PROOF VEST ARE MADE OUT OF AND SO UH YOU KNOW HE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD BUT HE WAS UNHARMED YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK I THINK HE MIGHT'VE GONE TO THE HOSPITAL ANYWAY JUST TO YOU KNOW BE LOOKED AT BUT
UM HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CONCUSSION OR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
BUT UH
SO IT'S KIND OF SCARY
LIVING AT UM HOUSTON'S GOT A LOT OF CRIME
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AND UH I JUST THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE RESTRICTION ON WHO BUYS GUNS
INSTEAD OF JUST BEING ABLE TO WALK INTO A STORE AND BUY A GUN THEY SHOULD HAVE A WAITING PERIOD
EXACTLY
AND I AND AS FAR AS HUNTING I'M SU- YOU KNOW THIS IS THE SAME THING AND IF IF YOU ARE A A YOU KNOW A LEGITIMATE HUNTER OR YOU JUST NEED A HANDGUN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT A TWO WEEK OR THREE WEEK WAIT PERIOD IS NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
IF YOUR CRIMINAL AND YOU NEED A GUN FOR THAT NIGHT IT'S G- YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU A LITTLE BIT MAD
BUT THEY SHOULD YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF RESTRICTIONS AND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT
THEY DON'T REQUIRE EVERYBODY TO HAVE A PERMIT
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GUN YOU NEED TO TO YOU KNOW REGISTER IT AND AND
HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON AS TO WHY YOU HAVE IT
AND IT I I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY DO THAT IN TEXAS DO THEY
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
THAT'S TRUE
I KNOW IT'D JUST MAKE IT IT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO GET THEM BUT THEY STILL COULD BUT
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA YEAH
HUM-UM BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM
NO NOT NOT REALLY MY MY DADDY WAS ALWAYS A HUNTER SO WE ALWAYS HAD RIFLES OR SHOTGUNS OR THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS RESPONSIBLE WITH THOSE AND
UM THERE WAS NEVER AN ACCIDENT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND WE'VE NEVER BEEN ROBBED OR MUGGED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
UM-HUM
OH MY GOODNESS
MY OH MY GOODNESS
OH MY GOODNESS
OH
OH MY GOODNESS
OH HOW FRIGHTENING
IT REALLY IS
BUT THEY YOU KNOW AND THEY HAVE WHEN MY SISTER WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SHE HA-
I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH WHAT UM
WH- DO DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN AT ALL TO BEGIN WITH
PEDIATRICS
I
OH ARE YOU UM WHAT ARE YOU A NURSE ARE YOU A DOCTOR UH
IS AN ATTENDANT A PHYSICIANS ASSISTANT
I SEE SO
I'VE NO WELL I MEAN THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS I HAVEN'T HEARD OF SO I I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THAT NO NOT PARTICULARLY WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO EXACTLY
YEAH
UM-HUM HUM HUM
OH BOY
NO I DO NOT NONE THAT I'M AWARE OF ANYWAY AS THEY SAY UM
NO I UH NO I DO NOT HAVE HAVE ANY CHILDREN I'M VERY I'M MOSTLY HAPPILY SINGLE
UH
YEAH I I IT IS I I UM
UH I DON'T KNOW I HAVE I HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS ON THE ON THE SUBJECT IT'S KIND OF
FOR ME THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION IS IS IS UH REMINISCENT OF UH ANSWER YES OR NO HAVE YOU STOPPED BEATING YOUR WIFE
UH UM IT PRE SUPPOSES SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE FIRST OF ALL THAT YOU THINK THAT CHILD CARE SHOULD BE DONE BY OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES THE PEOPLE HAVING THE KIDS
BUT UM I'M I'M A LITTLE LI- I DON'T KNOW I'VE I'VE GOT MY OWN VIEWS ON THAT I
WELL UH
HEY THERE YOU GO
UM I DON'T KNOW I I TEND TO THINK THAT CHILD CARE IS KIND OF OVERUSED I THINK THERE'S A
KIND OF OVERUSED IN A SENSE IT'S THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A TWO INCOME FAMILY AND NOTHING IS GOING TO BE CHANGED YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF QUALITY TIME OVER
OVER QUANTITY OF TIME SPENT WITH KIDS WHICH I THINK IS NONSENSE
THAT'S THE REASON ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THAT SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO BADLY IS SO MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THEM AS A JUST A JUST A TAX PAYER FINANCED BABYSITTING SERVICE
YOU KNOW BUT ANYWAY THAT'S JUST ME
YEAH
THERE'S A GOOD PHRASE
UM-HUM
YEAH OH YEAH I I UNDERSTAND THAT
IF SOMEBODY WOULD AT LEAST  I DON'T KNOW IT'S IT'S ROUGH AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A
WELL THERE A
GIVING AN EXAMPLE MY GIRLFRIEND'S UH SISTER
IS UM MARRY MARRIED A UH
MARRIED A UH PSYCHOLOGIST AND WHERE THEY'RE LIVING HE THEY CAN THEY CAN AFFORD FOR HER NOT TO WORK
WHICH SHE HAS NOT BEEN DOING SINCE THEY SINCE THEY'VE HAD UH CHILDREN
AND ESPECIALLY I I THINK IT WOULD BE ULTIMATE REALLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE SHE JUST HAD TWINS NOT VERY LONG AGO
AND UH
AND UH THEY
WELL I WORK WITH CHILDREN UM I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT NOW UH MYSELF UM
BUT WE DEFINITELY DO WANT TO HAVE UM CHILDREN AND I WORK IN THE MEDICAL FIELD SO I WORK WITH CHILDREN DURING THE DAY QUITE A BIT
UM WELL I HAVE WORKED IN FAMILY PRACTICE WHICH IN LARGE PART WAS PEDIATRICS
SO I'M
WELL AWARE OF
CHILD CARE PROBLEMS AND NEEDS
I'M A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT
UM-HUM
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT
HUM
UM WELL WE'RE TRAIN TO DIAGNOSE AND PRESCRIBE AND
UM IN SOME STATES ANYWAY THEIR PRESCRIBING LAWS ARE DIFFERENT AND
IN THE PARTICULAR JOB THAT I RECENTLY LEFT UM
I WAS FUNCTIONING
AS A FAMILY PRACTITIONER AND
JUST SEEING PATIENTS OF ALL VARIETIES WHATEVER YOU'D SEE IN NORMAL FAMILY PRACTICE
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I DID AND I SAW KIDS A LOT
THEY LIKED TO SEE ME BECAUSE I WASN'T AN INTIMIDATING MAN DOCTOR I GUESS
SO THEY APPRECIATED THAT
BUT
SO DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN
HM
UM-HUM
WELL WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS
YOU CAN TELL ME I'VE
DOESN'T MATTER IF I AGREE OR NOT OH
KIND OF WHAT
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL I AGREE WITH YOU THERE I I GUESS
UM
I- I SUPPOSE
YOU KNOW YOU COULD CALL ME A CAREER WOMAN BUT I I DO FEEL THAT I WANT TO BE AT HOME WITH MY KIDS MAINLY BECAUSE I SEE THAT AS SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING UM
THAT
ALSO I KNOW OF WHAT A JOB TAKES OUT OF ME
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT OVER FOR MY KIDS AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT TO MYSELF YOU KNOW
I MEAN THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE AND HELP THEM BE CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
SO
SO I I'M WITH YOU THERE ON THE OTHER HAND I HAVE A LOT FRIENDS WHO ARE MOTHERS AND WORK FULL TIME IN THEIR CAREERS AND I WOULDN'T
YOU KNOW I
THEIR KIDS ARE DARLING TOO AND I I WOULD HATE TO GIVE THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT I JU- AM JUDGING THEM
YEAH BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE SOME THAT ARE SACRIFICING THEIR KIDS FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR JOBS AND YOU KNOW
I'M SURE THEIR KIDS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SERVED IF
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH
YEAH THERE'S NO WAY
DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ISSUE OF UH RANDOM OR SPOT DRUG TESTING
UM-HUM
YEAH I- I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE JOBS WHERE UH
WHERE THE THE PERSON HAS THE SAFETY OF OTHER PEOPLE UH IN THEIR OWN HANDS OR WITHIN THEIR CONTROL THEN I THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY
YOU KNOW THE THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY UM YOU KNOW THE UH
THE DEFENSE AND MILITARY YOU KNOW ANY ANY APPLICATION LIKE THAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
RIGHT
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH Y- YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN EASILY ENVISION THE ONE ONE MISTAKE COULD YOU KNOW RUIN A A CAREER THAT COULDN'T BE UH YOU KNOW COULDN'T BE RESURRECTED
YEAH
NO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
HUH
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW FOR ANY ANY OF THE
JUST ROUTINE JOBS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THAT KIND OF INVASION OF PRIVACY
UM
ONLY FOR THE ONLY FOR THE ONES WHERE IT'S CRITICAL
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH I- I GUESS I WOULD FEEL THAT THE YOU KNOW POLICE
UH THAT THE POLICE SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC UH SAFETY ISSUES WHERE YOU KNOW MANDATORY DRUG TESTING WHERE IT WOULD BE FAVORABLE
UH
WELL I'M I'M FOR IT BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCE UH IN TAKING
UH DRUG TESTS MY UH MY PAST EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY
PLUS UH MY CURRENT OCCUPATION WORKING UH FOR A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS
UH I FEEL THAT IT'S UH
THERE IS SOME OPINIONS WHEREAS THE UH UH PEOPLE OF THE MIND THAT UH IT'S A RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT
YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A BODILY FUNCTION INVOLVED AND THAT UM
UM PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SO FORTH BUT I DON'T AGREE I THINK THAT
UM IT'S IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY FOR SOME JOBS AND SOME JOG O- JOB OCCUPATIONS
THAT UM PEOPLE CAN BE SCREENED FOR UH SHOULD BE SCREENS FOR UH FOR DRUGS THROUGH UH DRUG TESTING
UM-HUM
RIGHT
YEAH
SO I THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT THAT THAT UH UH THAT IT'S A GOOD UH IT'S A GOOD IDEA IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE RESERVATION I HAVE THOUGH IN THAT FROM MY EXPER- I'VE TAKEN MANY URINA- MANY DRUG TESTS
SOME OF THEM RANDOM SOME OF THEM UM SCHEDULED
UH AND EVERY TIME YOU TAKE ONE OF THOSE TESTS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SUBMITTING A SAMPLE
THERE'S ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND WELL HOW ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE CONDUCTING THE TEST
THE LABS THAT ARE PERFORMING THE TEST HOW ADEQUATE UH ARE THOSE FACILITIES AND UH IS IS ALWAYS IT IS IT ALWAYS A CHANCE I KNOW THAT WHAT THEY CALL UM THE I THINK IT'S CALLED THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY
OF THE UH THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES I KNOW IN THE MI- IN THE MILITARY PARTICULARLY THEY THERE'S A THEY GO TO GREAT LENGTHS AT PROTECTING THE SAMPLES BEFORE THEY GET TO THE LABS
BUT MY CONCERN IS AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED
IS THE UH THE STANDARDIZATION AND TO HAVE SOME HUNDRED PERCENT INSURANCE THAT THE TEST THAT'S GIVEN
UH THE THE THE LAB THAT PERFORMS THE UH THE ANALYSIS IS UH VALIDATED IN SOME WAY YOU KNOW SOME STANDARDIZATION BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SOME HORROR STORIES
YOU KNOW
SIXTY MINUTES DID AN ARTICLE ON THIS WHOLE SUBJ- SUBJECT A FEW UH A FEW YEARS AGO AND THERE WAS A AIR FORCE CAPTAIN
WHO UH YOU KNOW TOOK THE TEST AND IT CAME UP POSITIVE  AND THE GUY SWORE ON A STACK OF BIBLES
NOW IN THE MILITARY FOR A FOR A STAFF STAFF NCO WHICH IS A A NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER BUT IT'S A CERTAIN RANK ABOVE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH MIL- MILITARY RANK STRUCTURE
IT'S A IT'S A HIGH LEVEL OF ENLISTED PERSONNEL AND OFFICERS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP POSITIVE ON ONE DRUG TEST THEY'RE IMMEDIATELY DISCHARGED
NOW FOR CERTAIN RANKS AND BELOW LIKE SERGEANT AND BELOW IF YOU'RE FOUND POSITIVE OR COME UP DIRTY IN A DRU- ON A ON A DRUG TEST
YOU CAN BE REDUCED IN RANK FORFEIT YOUR PAY OR IF IT'S A REPEAT REPEAT O- UH OFFENSE
THEN THEY CAN DISCHARGE YOU
BUT THERE'S THIS AR- THIS THIS
AIR FORCE CAPTAIN HE SWORE UP AND DOWN THAT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
AND THEY WENT BACK AND YOU KNOW FEW MONTHS LATER TO TRY TO INVESTIGATE THE LAB AND THE SAMPLE THAT HE HAD GIVEN WAS DESTROYED
SO I- I THINK YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH STUFF LIKE THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN ABOUT THE WHOLE ISSUE I THINK
YEAH
UM-HUM
UH YEAH BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG THING IN IN THE IN THE HERE ON THE EAST COAST THE BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT UH THE POLICEMEN'S ASSOCIATION
TOOK THE UH THE BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO COURT BECAUSE THEY WERE UH TRYING TO INSTITUTE DRUG TESTS FOR THE COPS HERE IN BOSTON
AND UM THEY WON THE POLICE DE- THE THE POLICE ASSOCIATION WON
AND I- IT WAS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY TYPE DEAL THAT THEY APPROACHED IT AND THE COURTS AGREED
YEAH
OH YEAH
WELL UH DOES THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR TEST FOR DRUGS
HUH
UH NO WE'RE NOT BEING TESTED FOR DRUGS AT ALL UH
OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MANUAL UH THE FURTHEST IT GOES ABOUT DRUGS IS IN THE KIND OF THE MISCELLANEOUS SECTION OR IT'S REASONS FOR IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL IT SAYS USE OF NARCOTICS ON COMPANY PREMISES
SO  AND I'M AN ENGINEER THERE BUT I DO GO ON A LOT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES BUT I DON'T OPERATE ANY MACHINERY
NOW PEOPLE FOR OUR COMPANY THAT DO OPERATE MACHINERY LIKE DRILL RIGS AND THINGS LIKE  THAT ARE UNDER A A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE
AT A HIGHER RISK OF EXPOSURE AND BLOOD SCREENING IS PART OF THAT AND I- I THINK THAT DRUGS THEY DO TEST FOR DRUGS IN THAT CAPACITY BUT IT'S NOT THEIR EXCLUSIVE IT'S JUST PART IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT TURNS UP IN THE OTHER PARAMETERS THAT THEY TEST FOR
BUT I THINK IT'S GOT A LITTLE MORE RELEVANCE SINCE THEY ARE AROUND DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND DO HAVE TO EXERCISE SOME QUICK JUDGMENT IN THE FIELD WHAT IS THE NATURE OF YOUR COMPANY'S BUSINESS
HUH
OH REALLY
RIGHT  WE THAT'S BEEN AN A AN ISSUE UH
IN OUR COMPANY EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE RANDOM OR EVEN REGULAR DRUG SCREENING IN FACT THEY'LL  HAVE THESE LITTLE PARTIES AND PEOPLE WILL JUST GET I MEAN I'VE MY BROTHER LIVES NEAR WHERE I WORK AND I HAVE MANY A TIME CALLED HIM TO COME GET ME YOU KNOW AND UM
UH BUT Y- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT SERVING
BEER BY THE KEG YOU KNOW BUT UM I THINK DRUG TESTING AND I- I DON'T KNOW
I GUESS I C- I THINK IT'S GOT SOME RELEVANCE BUT I THINK ITS RELEVANCE IS PRETTY LIMITED I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW IN YOUR CASE I DON'T THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD NECESSARILY BE SUBJECTED TO DRUG TESTING I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING POLICY YOUR COMPANY HAS ABOUT TESTING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AN ON THE JOB ACCIDENT
UM-HUM
OH
RIGHT
ACTUALLY UM THEY JUST RECENTLY STARTED A POLICY OF TESTING DRUGS WHICH WAS KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE W- WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR THEM UM THEY DIDN'T DO THAT BUT UH SINCE THEN THEY'VE THEY'VE STARTED A
DRUG TESTING POLICY NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN UM CONVICTIONS BUT BECAUSE THE CLIENTS OF OUR COMPANY ARE REQUESTING THAT WE DO THAT
HOW ABOUT YOU
UH-HUH
HUM
OKAY
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY UH WE DO OIL WELL SERVICES SO A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS ARE OIL COMPANIES BIG OIL COMPANIES AND THEY GO OUT TO
WE HAVE ENGINEERS WHO UH GO OUT TO THE OIL WELL  TO THE TO THE CLIENT'S OIL WELL AND AND WORK WITH A LOT OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND PUT TOOLS DOWN THE OIL WELL AND STUFF SO THE CLIENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT
YOU KNOW THE ENGINEERS WHO GO OUT THERE ARE ADHERING TO THEIR DRUG POLICY BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THEIR THEIR YOU KNOW TERRITORY AND EVERYTHING BUT
THE THING THAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT I W- I'M AN ENGINEER AND A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND I WORK IN THE SOFTWARE UH HOUSE AND EVERYBODY THERE YOU KNOW ARE ALL SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THEY'VE NEVER YOU KNOW THEY NEVER GO OUT TO THE THE OIL RIGS OR ANYTHING AND
YET WE'RE GETTING WE'RE SUBJECTED TO THIS POLICY YOU KNOW THE SAME ONE THAT UH TH- ALL THE ENGINEERS HAVE TO TO WELL A LITTLE DIFFERENT ACTUALLY BUT UM YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THING AND IT'S
BUT IT'S UH IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT I GUESS THAN THAN A LOT OF DRUG POLICIES IN OUR CASE IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU HIRE ON THEY'LL TEST YOU AND THEN IF YOU GET INJURED ON THE JOB IF YOU LIKE TRIP AND FALL OR SOMETHING UH THEY GIVE YOU A DRUG TEST RIGHT AWAY
OTHER THAN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE RANDOM TESTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE REALLY UPSET WITH THE POLICY AT FIRST PARTICULARLY LIKE UM WE HAVE A LOT OF PARTIES AND STUFF WHERE THEY SERVE ALCOHOL AND THA- THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU KNOW BUT
UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY BIZARRE
UH PARTICULARLY LIKE WHERE WE ARE YOU KNOW I- THERE WAS A STORY OF A WOMAN LAST YEAR WHO WHO ACTUALLY DID SLIP ON THE ICE AND AND LIKE SPRAINED HER ANKLE AND SHE SHE WAS A PERSONNEL SECRETARY AND SHE  HAD TO GET TESTED
AND I DON'T KNOW I'M AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING I YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ON THE ONE HAND IT'S LIKE IF
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT IN SOME SENSE AND YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE YOU'RE I MEAN EMPLOYMENTS ARE CONTRACTUAL BY NATURE ANYWAY
BUT UM
I HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB THAT WHERE I HAD TO UM UH DO A DRUG TEST AND AND IT'S IT WAS KIND OF A LONG STORY BUT IT WAS IT WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE WHAT I WENT THROUGH AND IT AMOUNTED TO
UM GOING IN UH BEFORE ANY OF THESE INTERVIEWS I'M NOT EVEN WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY I'M GOING IN FOR LIKE INTERVIEWS AND THEY FLEW ME OUT TO CHICAGO AND AND UH BEFORE I WENT IN TO ANY OF THE INTERVIEWS UH THEY TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR TO GIVE ME A PHYSICAL THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE A PHYSICAL YOU KNOW
AND UM ACTUALLY BEC- BEFOREHAND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE GOING TO UH DO DRUG SCREENING
BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT AND SO BASICALLY I'D ALREADY PEED OFF IN THAT MORNING AND
AND WHEN I GOT IN THERE I DIDN'T I WASN'T LIKE ABLE TO GIVE A FULL SAMPLE AND SO THEY MADE ME SIT AND WAIT FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES DRINK A WHOLE TON OF WATER BEFORE  I WENT TO ANY OF THE INTERVIEWS
STEVE UH WITH THE ELECTION YEAR AND WHATNOT COMING UP DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO CUT TAXES RAISE THEM OR OR OR WHAT DO YOU THINK
UH-HUH
SEE I NEVER THOUGHT REALLY IT'S UH
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT THAT THAT THE THE QUESTION REALLY HAD TO DO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE I I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE THE REAL QUESTION WAS IS ARE WE GETTING A REASONABLE RETURN ON ON INVESTMENT
FOR INSTANCE LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX OR SOC- UH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S TAX WE'RE PAYING MONEY AND AND SUPPOSEDLY THIS MONEY IS GOING INTO SOME KIND OF FUND SO THAT WHEN IT COMES OUR TURN TO RETIRE THE MONEY WILL BE THERE FOR US
THAT'S YEAH I YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I SEE THAT MONEY TAKEN OUT OF MY PAYCHECK EACH EACH WEEK I OR EACH EVERY OTHER WEEK I I REALLY THINK THAT MONEY'S HISTORY
AND YOU KNOW SO AS FAR AS RETURN INVESTMENT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOTHING AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GET THE EXACT SAME NUMBER OF DOLLARS BACK
UH SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS A UH UH THERE'S STILL AN OFFICE IN UH YOU KNOW STAFFED WITH WITH PEOPLE THERE AND IN DC THAT ARE RESEARCHING TO FIND A CURE FOR POLIO
WHICH I MAY BE WRONG BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CURE FOR POLIO IS ALREADY FOUNDED BUT BUT SUPPOSEDLY ONCE YOU HAVE AN OFFICE IN DC OR YOU KNOW AND AND STAFF IT WITH PEOPLE IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO CLOSE IT DOWN AND AND THEY JUST HAVEN'T YET
UH-HUH
WELL THAT MIGHT BE THE DIFFERENCE I DON'T KNOW UH THE OTHER THING THAT UH I REMEMBER SEEING ON TV LATELY IS UH HAD TO DO WITH
IT'S LIKE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE HISTORICAL SITES IN AMERICA ARE IN THE HOME DISTRICTS OF VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE POLITICALLY
THAT THAT HISTOR- FOR SOME REASON HISTORICAL SITES WITH YOU KNOW THE THE FULL FEDERAL MONEY AND EVERYTHING
SEEM TO APPEAR AS AS ALMOST AS LIKE POLITICAL FAVORS TO TO VERY STRONG POLITICIANS
UH-HUH
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU UH YOU THINK THAT THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO SAVE SOME MONEY BY UH PASSING THE LINE ITEM VETO
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH PORK BARREL POLITICS
YEAH BUT MASSACHUSETTS WASN'T WHEN DUKAKIS WAS THERE ANYWAY WASN'T IN THAT GREAT SHAPE FINANCIALLY
UH-HUH I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I
IT'S UH I MEAN IT'S IT'S TOUGH I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S TWO WAYS YOU CAN KIND OF GO TO GET OUT OF TOUGH FINANCIAL SITUATIONS I GUESS YOU CAN LIKE RAISE TAXES AND THEN CREATE LIKE JOB PROGRAMS AND WHATNOT
OR YOU CAN HOPE THAT IF PEOPLE KEEP THEIR MONEY THAT THEY'LL SPEND MORE AND CREATE JOBS AND AND WHATNOT
WELL THAT'S  THAT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION I DO KNOW THAT UH POLITICIANS ALWAYS TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF THEIR MOUTHS UM
I LET'S EXAMPLE UH O- OUR FRIEND THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW SAYS NO NEW TAXES WE SHOULD AND ESPECIALLY IF ANYTHING BE CUTTING TAXES NOW BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME THE BUDGET HE SENT TO CONGRESS HAS
TAX AND FEE INCREASES SO UH I KNOW THE POLITICIANS UH AREN'T AREN'T STRAIGHTFORWARD NOW I- IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS I'M NOT IT'S HARD HARD TO CALL IT REALLY IS
HM RIGHT
YES UH
WELL YEAH I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE UH ABOUT POLIO IN PARTICULAR I KNOW WE HAVE A POLIO VACCINE WHICH WILL PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM GETTING POLIO I'M NOT SURE IF WE KNOW WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF CURING SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALREADY GOTTEN POLIO
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE UH IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BUSH IS BEEN TRYING REALLY HARD TO GET AHOLD OF IS THE LINE ITEM VETO WHERE UH YOU KNOW CONGRESS IS ABLE TO ATTACH ALL KINDS OF
UH FUNNY AMENDMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL UH C- CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS TO THE TO THE MAIN BUDGET PROPOSALS AND
THE POOR PRESIDENT HAS HAS TO UH EITHER ACCEPT OR REJECT THE WHOLE THING
UH
I I THINK THE LINE ITEM VETO IS NOT NOT IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING ASSUMING THAT THE UH
THE THE PRESIDENT UH USES IT TO GET RID OF UH THIS KIND OF WASTE ON THE OTHER HAND UH
UH IT IT ASSUMES THAT YOU HAVE LOTS OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUR PRESIDENT NOT TO VETO IMPORTANT THINGS
RIGHT AND JUST TO GET RID OF THE UNIMPORTANT THINGS AND WHENEVER THERE'S THAT KIND OF SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A DISPUTE AS TO UH WHERE THE EXA- WHERE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN WASTE AND AND NECESSITY IS
SO I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT THAT WILL HELP SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BUT THERE DEFINITELY IS IS A PROBLEM WITH UH I FORGOT THERE'S A POLITICAL TERM FOR THIS STUFF PORK BARREL OR SOMETHING
UH PORK BARREL POLITICS THE- THE- THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO DO IT I KNOW STATE GOVERNORS USUALLY HAVE LINE ITEM VETOS AND UH
WE- I- I LIVED IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR A WHILE AND UH WHEN DUKAKIS VETOED CERTAIN THINGS THERE WAS A BIG UPROAR AND WASN'T NECESSARILY SO POPULAR
BUT AT LEAST AT THE END
YEAH I- I- THEY WERE VERY GOOD AT FIRST THEY WERE IN VERY GOOD FINANCIALS AT FIRST AND UH THAT'S PART OF THE REASON HE BECAME A NOMINEE IS BECAUSE THINGS WENT SO WELL AND THEN OF COURSE THE BOTTOM FELL OUT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ON UH ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN WHERE WOULD YOU RATE YOURSELF ON ON GUN CONTROL
MOST AND TEN BEING NO RESTRICTIONS AT ALL
UM-HUM YEAH I THINK I'D BE BE SOMEWHERE AROUND A FOUR OR FIVE MYSELF AND YEAH IT  IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THERE'S THERE'S
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT FAIR TO JUST KIND OF DO EVERYTHING ALL THE SAME WITH ALL GUNS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME YOU KNOW
LIKE HAND GUNS AND G- UH ASSAULT RIFLES I THINK ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS
SO
AND YOU DON'T NEED THREE HUNDRED ROUNDS A MINUTE TO TO GET HOLD OF A DEER AND
AND IF YOU DID IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE WORTH EATING SO  YOU KNOW
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE THAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I DON'T SEE UH
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA GO HEY I'LL GO HUNTING TODAY
A- AND USUALLY IF YOU'RE GONNA GO HUNTING IT'S PRETTY EARLY IN THE MORNING ANYWAY AND THE STORE IS NOT GONNA BE OPEN SO
A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME  I GUESS THE ONLY REAL QUESTIONS THEN IS UM IS GUN CONTROL DOES IT DOES IT WORK I MEAN CAN YOU ENFORCE IT
UM-HUM
YEAH THEY DON'T
I GUESS I MEAN THE ONLY THING THAT I WORR- I QUESTION IS I MEAN I THINK IF IF IT WAS REALLY EASY TO ENFORCE THAT IT IT WOULD BE GREAT THE ONLY THING THAT UH THAT WOULD WORRY ME ABOUT IT
IS THAT THE ONLY REAL WAY THAT I KNOW TO ENFORCE IT IS IF SOMEONE COMMITS A CRIME WHILE HAVING A WEAPON THAT'S NOT REGISTERED YOU CAN TAG ON A COUPLE OF EXTRA YEARS
BUT AS IT IS NOW YOU PUT SOMEONE IN PRISON AND THEY'RE OUT IN YOU KNOW ONE FIFTH THE TIME THEY WERE SENTENCED TO ANYWAY
SO I MEAN THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT EVEN STAYING IN PRISON WITHOUT THE EXTRA YEARS ON THERE MUCH LESS I DON'T THINK THEY'D BE STAYING ANY LONGER WITH EXTRA YEARS TAGGED ON THERE
UM-HUM I THINK YOU MIGHT'VE HAD THE I- I GUESS I MEAN I'M THAT'S GOT TO BE PART OF GUN CONTROL BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE UH THE WAITING PERIOD BECAUSE
I DON'T THINK THAT I MEAN I REALLY THINK THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GET A GUN TO COMMIT A CRIME THEY'RE GONNA GET A GUN BUT UH
IF SOMEONE IS JUST LIKE ALL HOT AND BOTHERED AND AND READY TO GO OUT AND AND AND GET SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHARGED UP EMOTIONALLY
THAT A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAY THAT ANGRY FOR THAT LONG
LEAST I'M NOT
YEAH
YEAH
UH
ONE BEING MAXIMUM CONTROL OR MINIMAL CONTROL
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE I'VE UH MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT
UH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
WELL UM I OURS MY FAMILIES FROM UH SOUTH GEORGIA AND YOU KNOW THEY HUNT QUITE A BIT SO I- I REALLY DON'T YOU KNOW GUNS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE  DOWN THERE AND UH
UH SO I- I TEND TO AGREE ON THAT YOU KNOW BUT UH
ASSAULT RIFLES YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S  MADE TO
MADE TO KILL SOMEBODY YOU KNOW
UH
YEAH SO YEAH I FEEL
YEAH RIGHT OR CLEANING
BUT
UH I I'VE HEARD SOME
UH TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING LIKE A THREE DAY WAITING PERIOD OR SOMETHING UH IF YOU TO TRY TO BUY A FIREARM OR SOMETHING
AND I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU'VE GOT A IF YOU'VE GOT A  HISTORY OF UH OF VIOLENT CRIMES OR SOMETHING THEN YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED A
HAND GUN
UH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
WELL  UH I THINK IT IT
I MEAN IF YOU CAN IF YOU'RE GONNA COMMIT SOME VIOLENT CRIME AND YOU GO AND YOU CAN GET A GUN AT YOUR LEISURE THEN
UH TO TO RESTRICT IT WOULD CERTAINLY CUT DOWN ON ON THAT BUT
YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE YOU CAN GET A GUN FAIRLY EASILY I WOULD THINK I MEAN I- I FEEL LIKE I COULD GET A GUN IN AN HOUR IF I HAD TO YOU KNOW SO UH OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT GONNA
UH GET RID OF ALL ALL OF YOUR UM ILLEGAL WEAPONS OUT THERE OR OR DAN- YOU KNOW GET DANGEROUS WEAPONS OUT OF PEOPLE'S HANDS BUT  UH I THINK IT'D HELP SOME
YEAH
YEAH NO TIME
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I DON'T I DON'T REALLY THINK UH I MEAN I THINK GUN CONTROL UH TO SOME EXTENT CAN COULD HELP CRIME SITUATIONS BUT  UH I THINK
I PERSONALLY MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS YOU KNOW AS YOU COMMIT A CRIME YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND AND  AND IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET PUNISHED OR VERY LITTLE PUNISHMENT THEN THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO
YEAH
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH USUALLY NOT
YEAH I- I- I AGREE AT LEAST YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THEY'RE OUT OF LINE DE- DEVIL'S ADVOCATE POSSIBLY BUT IT YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID PAYING TAXES AND WHETH- WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THAT LAW
I- YOU'RE STILL CIRCUMVENTING IT YOU ARE LEGAL IN IN YOUR CIRCUMVENTION OF THAT LAW
UH REALLY I- I- I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VALID ARGUMENT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE QUITE AWARE THEY'RE NOT PAYING THAT SIX PERCENT SALES TAX UM S- NATURALLY SOME SOME THINGS YOU JUST CAN'T FIND IN YOUR LOCAL KMART OR OR  UM
BRYN MAWR STEREO DEALER UM BUT
TH- TH- THEN WHY NOT PAY PAY THE SALES TAX TO PENNSYLVANIA CORPORATIONS HAVE TO WHY SHOULD AN INDIVIDUAL JUST BECAUSE IT'S JUST BECAUSE THE STATE CAN'T REALLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT BE ABLE TO AVOID PAYING SALES TAX
YES
I I'LL AGREE IT IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT
I- B- IS IT ALSO LEGAL
FOR YOU TO DO THAT W- W- FR- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM V- V- VARIOUS NET READINGS I- I- IT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TRY TO LEGISLATE A MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE
TAX SCHEMES UM IN INTO PLACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IT IS IT IS A LOST REVENUE STREAM RIGHT NOW AND STATES C- CAN USE ALL THE REVENUE THEY CAN GET WITH SOME WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT W- DO YOUR ARGUMENTS STILL APPLY
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT BUSINESSES DO AT THE PRESENT
AND I- I
I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES PURCHASING SOMETHING MAIL ORDER AND THEN HAVING HAVING TO PAY SALES TAX ON IT
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY UM THE WAY IT WORKS USUALLY THE THE PERSON ORDERING IT DOESN'T PAY BUT THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT WILL UH SUCK UP ALL THE BILLS AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY
AND THERE R- THERE ARE S- SOME SUBSTANTIAL NASTY PENALTIES UM IF YOU IF BUSINESSES TRY TO AVOID THAT
A AS IF
NO BUSINESSES UM IF
PURCHASING THINGS MAIL ORDER IF I IF I'M A COMPUTER CONSULTING FIRM AND I SEE THESE THIS GREAT DEAL ON FORTY EIGHTY SIX MOTHERBOARDS UH FROM FROM SAY UTAH UM
I- I MIGHT BUY THE MOTHERBOARDS FROM UTAH BUT THEN STILL HAVE TO PAY SOME PENNSYLVANIA SALES TAX MY A- ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT WILL AT THE END OF THE MONTH
UH I THINK THAT  I THINK THAT'S THE WAY THINGS WORK IN PENNSYLVANIA AND I KNOW THEY WORK THAT WAY IN UH SAY HERE IN DC
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE I- I- A R- A BIG HOLE DOES EXIST RIGHT NOW UH IN THAT CONSUMERS CAN JUST SAY OH I- I FORGOT THAT THERE THERE IS NO WELL DEFINED MECHANISM AT ALL AND AND THAT IT IS A  A A LOSS I- I THINK
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE UH WONDERFUL ABUSES IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES WHEREBY YOU CAN PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER
AND AFTER THE FACT THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA CAN FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND SEND YOU A BILL FOR THE SALES TAX APPROPRIATE TO THAT ITEM THAT YOU PURCHASED AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES FROM THE TIME THAT YOU BOUGHT IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS PENNSYLVANIA KIND OF OUT OF LINE THERE
WHAT WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW THOUGH I MEAN WHAT IF YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT YOU'RE SUBJECT TO PAYING UM INCOME TAX ON SOMETHING THAT YOU PURCHASE MAIL ORDER
WELL I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
GENERALLY AT LEAST IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I PURCHASE SOMETHING MAIL ORDER IT'S NOT TO CIRCUMVENT PAYING SALES TAX TO THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IT'S BECAUSE
I'M SORRY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA UH IT'S BECAUSE I- I CAN'T FIND THE ITEM THAT I WANT AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE ANYWHERE IN MY LOCAL AREA SO I GO OUTSIDE THE AREA FOR THAT
AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO POLICE MYSELF AND PAY PENNSYLVANIA WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE OWED
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE REVENUE STREAM WENT TO ANOTHER STATE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A AS A CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER
WELL I THINK THAT IF IF POLICY IS ESTABLISHED AND IF A MECHANISM IS PUT INTO PLACE TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IN THIS FASHION
THEN I DON'T ARGUE WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER TO REMEMBER THAT OH I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF STATE I NEED  TO XEROX THE RECEIPT AND MAKE OUT A CHECK FOR SIX PERCENT AND SEND IT TO PENNSYLVANIA
RIGHT BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT BUSINESSES DO THAT THE BUSINESS THAT YOU PURCHASE THE THING FROM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE APPROPRIATE SALES TAX AND FORWARDING IT TO THE STATE IN QUESTION THAT'S A COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE BURDEN SHOULDN'T BE PLACED ON THE CONSUMER
AH
UH DO YOU MEAN BUSINESSES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW AS OF OF SELLING THINGS TO A CONSUMER AND THEN BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALES TAX
OR PURCHASING
YEAH SEE I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T I NEVER SEE THAT END OF THE BUSINESS
SO MY ONLY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CONSUMER
UM BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE IF THE BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING THEMSELVES THEN I THINK SOME WELL DEFINED MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IN PLACE SO THAT
UM THE OPPORTUNITY F- TO FORGET THAT YOU OWE SALES TAX FOR SOMETHING UH CAN BE AVOIDED
PLAY
OH YEAH WELL I'M INTO IT UH
IS ANYBODY
REALLY
OH WOW
RIGHT
SUPER YEAH THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY I DID IT TOO ACTUALLY I I PLAYED UH JUST A TINY BIT WHEN I WAS REAL YOUNG AND THEN UH I W- I GOT ON TO A TEAM IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT WASN'T VERY GOOD STILL

RIGHT YEAH
UH-HUH WHAT I REALLY UH I UH HAD A CHANCE THEY HAD THE PGA TOURNAMENT UP IN INDIANAPOLIS LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO GO AND SEE ONE OF THE ROUNDS OF THAT AND THAT WAS REALLY FUN
I MEAN YOU KNEW IT YEAH I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS WOULD BE THAT MUCH FUN TO GO TO A BIG GOLF TOURNAMENT AND WATCH BUT MAN IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE JUST TO FOLLOW THOSE GUYS AROUND AND ACTUALLY WATCH THEM PLAY
RIGHT
YOU GOT
I MEAN IT'S UH IT'S A LOT MORE EXCITING THAN ACTUALLY W- W- THAN WATCHING IT ON TV AND IF YOU PICK A GROUP OF GOLFERS AND FOLLOW THEM AROUND I MEAN IT'S JUST
WATCHING THEM THE WHOLE TIME INSTEAD OF LIKE ON TV YOU GET TO SEE THEM MAKE A TEE SHOT AND THEN THEY GO OFF TO SOME OTHER HOLE AND THEY COME BACK WHEN THEY'RE PUTTING BUT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY SOMETHING ELSE
UH I'M A STUDENT RIGHT NOW

SO
YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YEAH
AND THOSE FEES TO JOIN A CLUB LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IS JUST THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL
I MEAN YOU'D REALLY WANT TO REALLY BE LIKING YOUR GOLF
YEAH I SAW ONE OF THOSE ON TV THAT IS PRETTY WILD
YEAH
WELL ALL RIGHT UM I- I GUESS I'LL START UM BY MENTIONING THAT UM BEING TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD I HAD A GREAT-GRANDMOTHER
WHO'S STILL ALIVE AT THIS POINT WHO WAS JUST RECENTLY PLACED IN A NURSING HOME AFTER THE DEATH OF MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
AND IT WAS A REAL PROBLEM  IN DOING THAT BECAUSE UH SHE HAS ALZHEIMER'S
AND UH SHE HAD NO WISH OR DESIRE TO GO INTO THAT KIND OF FACILITY AND UH WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT UH
HER LONG-TERM CARE MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER AFTER HE WAS FOUND OUT HE WAS GOING TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME UH ACTUALLY GAVE UP THE GHOST MORE OR LESS
AND PASSED ON O- ONLY ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THAT
UM-HUM
YEAH WE-
WE HAD
YEAH WE HAD UP HERE WHEN THEY GOT INTO UH WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER CAME OVER MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER CAME OVER HERE SHE ACTUALLY SPENT SOMETIME WITH US AND WE HAD TO HAVE A NURSE COME IN
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY WE COULDN'T HANDLE IT SHE KIND OF SHE'D LOST ALL BEARINGS AS TO WHERE SHE WAS AND SHE WOULD ACTUALLY WANDER AROUND UH WE WERE AFRAID SHE WOULD WANDER HERSELF INTO THE BASEMENT AND FALL DOWN THE STAIRS OR
UH YOU KNOW IT WAS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER HAD TAKEN CARE OF HER AND SHE DEMANDED ABSOLUTE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE SHE HAD TO BE WATCHED SHE HAD TO BE CLEANED
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IT WAS A DEMEANING PROCESS FOR MY FOR MY GRANDFA- GREAT-GRANDFATHER WE HAD NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH
UM HOW BAD SHE HAD DETERIORATED OVER THE UH YEARS I MEAN I SHE WOULD FORGET MY NAME AND SHE WOULD FORGET YOU KNOW HOW TO COOK OR HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF BUT WE DIDN'T REALIZE THE EXTENT
UNTIL AFTER MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER HAD A BAD STROKE
AND UM UM  WE HAD HER HERE AND WE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HER AND IT EVEN KIND OF DROVE THE NURSE A LITTLE CRAZY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MY MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER HAD FOUND UH MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER W- W- WAS AROUND DURING THE DEPRESSION SO HE HAD ACTUALLY HIDDEN A LOT OF MONEY IN THE HOUSE OVER THERE
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE MOMENT YOU GO INTO A NURSING HOME SITUATION THEY TAKE EVERYTHING
AND AND IT WAS IT WAS TERRIBLE AND VERY DEMEANING HE DIDN'T WANNA LOSE THE INDEPENDENCE AND
UH THAT WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY CATCH IT AS EARLY AS YOU SEEM TO HAVE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW PLANNING YOU KNOW OF LONG-TERM
UM-HUM UM-HUM
HM
MY MY GRANDMOTHER IS UM
HAD ALZHEIMER'S AND THROUGH THE PROCESS WE HAD TO REMOVE WE TRIED TO KEEP HER AT HOME AT OUR WE HAD TO REMOVE HER FROM HER HOME BECAUSE SHE WAS GETTING PARANOIAC AND TRIED TO KEEP HER AT OUR HOME AND
DID THAT AS LONG AS WE COULD BUT AGAIN THE PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT EVEN
E- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT MY PARENTS DID A GOOD JOB AT IT WHEN WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH BUT IT'S NOT AN EASY THING WHEN THEY'VE GOT ALZHEIMER'S BUT MY OTHER GRANDPARENTS
UM SIGNED UP FOR A RETIREMENT
TYPE THING IN PENNSYLVANIA UM ALREADY MY FATHER'S MUCH OLDER THAN MY MOTHER SO
WELL NO I GUESS IT ANYWAY MY GRAND- MY OTHER GRANDPARENTS ARE MUCH YOUNGER AND UM
THEY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY SOLD THEIR HOUSE AND BOUGHT A HOUSE
FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING IN THIS RETIREMENT COMPLEX AND THEY LIVE IN THAT HOUSE
AND THERE THERE THERE'S MINIMAL BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW THEY BOUGHT IT UM THEY'VE KIND OF BOUGHT INTO THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND THERE'S THERE'S CARE GIVEN FOR THE LAWN AND STUFF
AND UM AS THEY GET OLDER MORE CARE CAN BE GIVEN AND THERE'S SOME MINIMAL FEES THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS BE PAYING BUT THE BASIC FEE FOR HEALTH CARE AND ALL THAT IS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF
AND WHEN THEY GET TOO OLD THEY CAN MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT INSTEAD IT'S LIKE A DUPLEX THEY HAVE NOW
THEY CAN MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT AND THEN LATER NURSING
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO MY OTHER MY GRANDMOTHER MY GRANDFATHER HAD DIED AND SHE WANTED TO STAY ON AND THEN SHE GOT ALZHEIMER'S AND IT WAS A REALLY HARD THING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY I'M MUCH MORE APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT MY
MY OTHER SET OF GRANDPARENTS HAS DONE AND MY PARENTS HAVE ALREADY UM KIND OF LIKE GONE ON A WAITING LIST CAUSE IT'S SUCH A LONG THING BECAUSE IT PRESERVES THE DIGNITY
OF THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SITUATION AND IT'S A DECISION THAT MY PARENTS HAVE MADE AND IT WON'T BE A DRAIN ON OUR RESOURCES BECAUSE IT'LL MEAN JUST
UM YOU KNOW SELL SELLING THEIR HOUSE NOW AND BUYING INTO THAT AT THE SAME TIME
AND IT'S FAMILIAR
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL WE DIDN'T CATCH IT FOR MY FIRST GRANDMOTHER MY FIRST SET OF GRANDPARENTS
JOE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ELECTION TURNOUT'S GONNA BE THIS YEAR DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE TYPICALLY
BROWN
OH YES HE'S FROM DALLAS

UH BALLOT I THINK THERE W- THAT WE WILL HAVE THE LARGER PERCENTAGE OF VOTER TURNOUT THAN USUAL

I AND I THINK IT REPRESENTS UH MALAISE DUE TO WELL MY VOTE DOESN'T COUNT IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY IT'S IT'S REALLY I THINK IT'S MORE OF A PROBLEM IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS
I IT'S IT'S TOO BAD I YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR LOCAL POLITICIANS
EASIER TO GET A HOLD OF
DO YOU VOTE
YEAH
WELL I- I THINK IN YOUR CASE COLLEGE STUDENTS IN GENERAL PRETEND NOT TO PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL POLITICS I THINK THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH GOING ON
THAT'S NOT A PART OF YOUR WORLD
CAMPUS ELECTIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT I SUPPOSE
BUT THERE THERE'S VOTER APATHY THERE ISN'T THERE
ISN'T
YEAH
PARTICIPATE A LITTLE MORE BUT TH- UH
BUT ALSO THINK ABOUT THIS IF THEY'RE DUMB ENOUGH TO NOT VOTE DO WE REALLY WANT THEM TO VOTE
SOME OF US I THINK DO IT OUT OF HABIT
THAT'S A GOOD HABIT TO HAVE
UH TH- THIS YEAR UH I THINK IT'S INTERESTING UH WE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY CANDIDATES STILL THAT UH WE HAVE WELL THERE'S UH WE HAVE UH
UH CLINTON AND UH UH BROWN OF COURSE YEAH AND THEN UH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD MUCH ABOUT THIS THIS OTHER GUY THE INDEPENDENT PEROT
HE MAY BE DRAWING OFF SOME UH REPUBLICAN VOTES AND UH SO IT SEEM LIKE GEORGE BUSH HAS COMPLETELY LOCKED UP THE REPUBLICAN ALTHOUGH I THINK I DON'T
I GUESS HE HAS BUT
UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S HARD TO SAY I KNOW UH CLINTON AND BROWN ARE BOTH TRYING TO GO AFTER WH- WHATEVER THE BLOCK VOTE WHATEVER THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND UH
I DON'T KNOW I- I THINK IT'LL BE INTERESTING I KNOW A A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW ARE ARE STARTING TO FEEL ARE ARE MORE YOU KNOW WITH THE RE- UH RECESSION AND EVERYTHING I THINK A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO UH BECOME MORE POLITICALLY ACTIVELY I MEAN
I TH- I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE WHY WHAT DO YOU THINK
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
OH YOU SEE IF YEAH RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT YEAH YEAH I AGREE YEAH
YEAH I YEAH I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU THERE I MEAN IT'S PEOPLE I MEAN TH- THAT DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT UH UH LIKE FEDERAL THINGS OR YOU KNOW THINGS YOU KNOW
UH LIKE THE DEFICIT PEOPLE WHO DON'T WHO DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY CLUES TO WHAT'S GOING ON LIKE RIGHT UNDER RIGHT IN THEIR OWN TOWNS OR COUNTIES OR
STATE OR WHATEVER SO YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU YEAH I THINK PEOPLE ARE EVEN YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH YOU YOU'D THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE IN TOUCH UH THEY'RE YOU KNOW GEOGRA- I MEAN UH GEOGRAPHIC- HM
EXACTLY SURE YEAH AND I MEAN MOST OF THEM ARE EVEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL SEE THEM YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY TIMES A YEAR I MEAN THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN YOUR CITY
YOU KNOW IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR WHATEVER BUT UH YEAH I YEAH YEAH IT IS INTERESTING HOW THAT WORKS AND PEOPLE JUST I DON'T KNOW THEY JUST
UH YEAH YEAH YEAH I DO VOTE UH I KNOW IF I WHEN I FIRST REGISTERED UH
I GUESS WITH THE LAST ELECTION UH I WAS UH IN MY LATE TEENS SO I ONLY REALLY REGISTERED AND VOTED FOR THE UH WHO WAS THAT THEN THAT WAS UH DUKAKIS AND UH
UH YEAH DUKAKIS AND BUSH I GUESS IT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT WAS I GUESS THAT WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I VOTED IN BUT UH
AT THAT TIME I WAS REALLY APOLITICAL I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT
AND LIKE YOU SAID ABOUT UH LOCAL UH GOVERN- OR LOCAL UH POLITICS I WAS JUST
YOU KNOW NOT IN IN TOUCH AT ALL
YEAH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S TRUE YEAH
NO NO THAT'S TRUE UM
CAMPUS CAMPUS YEAH  YEAH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER THAT'S ANOTHER THING TOO
YEAH WELL I'D SAY SO SURE I- I KNOW I'VE NEVER VOTED IN ANY OF THE JUST UH
AND WHY I- I DON'T KNOW I JUST DON'T SEE ANY I DON'T UH I DON'T SEE ANY IMPORTANCE AT ALL IN MY VOTE IN THE YOU KNOW IN THAT IN THAT EVEN THAT SMALLER UH
UH ARENA OF POLITICS I DON'T EVEN SEE UH YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF INFLUENCE OR ANYTHING OR ANY YOU KNOW
UH
UM BUT UH YEAH FEDERALLY DEFI- I- I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD EVERYBODY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW UH SHOULD DEFINITELY BE UH
UH AWARE OF UH YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THEY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW UH
YEAH YEAH THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD PARTICIPATE UH YOU KNOW
UM YEAH  YEAH B- BUT BUT I- I- I THINK IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE YOU KNOW UH I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT VOTE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO UM
JEEZ N- NOW THAT'S HARD TO SAY IT'S HARD TO SAY WHO VOTES AND AND WHY UM
YEAH I- I MEAN
SO UH WHAT THINGS DO YOU CONSIDER AN INVASION OF PRIVACY
OH I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT I WAS THINKING OF LIKE UH
I DON'T KNOW I ST- I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE BIG
YOU KNOW DATA BASES THEY HAVE WITH ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU ON THEM LIKE THE CREDIT REPORTS AND
AND ALL THOSE YOU KNOW DEMOGRAPHICS STUDIES THAT THEY DO THAT
UM YOU KNOW HAVE
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH YOU KNOW
STUFF ABOUT ALL THE PURCHASES THAT YOU'VE MADE AND
EVERYTHING KEPT TRACT SOMEWHERE AND
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE STUFF ACTUALLY WHAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE IN THERE BUT
I KNOW THEY USE THAT I MEAN THEY
THEY SELL THOSE T-
YEAH THAT WAS THAT W- THAT WAS THE OTHER ONE I WAS THINKING OF
I THINK THAT'S UH
I MEAN I KNOW DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL
UH UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM  WELL I I THINK THAT UM
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW A PERSON'S COMPETENCE SHOULD BE MORE DETERMINED BY
YOU KNOW THEIR ACTIONS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR AND IF THEY'RE
YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE ON SOME KIND OF
YOU KNOW CONTROLL- CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE THEN YOU KNOW IT KINDS OF TAKES AWAY FROM THE JOB OF YOU KNOW THE SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER TYPE PERSON
KNOW WHO IS ABLE TO EVALUATE THEM I THINK THEY SHOULD BE EVALUATED THAT WAY RATHER THAN  WITH A
YOU KNOW A CHEMICAL YOU KNOW
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CARRIERS AND DON'T UH DON'T REVEAL IT
YEAH THAT'S THAT WOULD BE KIND OF AN EXTREME
I MEAN I'VE HEARD OF THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW MAKING THEM
YOU KNOW UH MARKING THEM SOMEHOW OR YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR
YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM ALL S- SOME PLACE LIKE IN A KIND OF A
YEAH WELL I GUESS IT KIND OF BORDERS ON WHERE
I MEAN
WHAT DO YOU VALUE MORE THE INVASION OF UH THE PERSON'S PRIVACY OR THE POSSIBLE DANGER TO
YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE
YEAH
I GUESS THAT'S ALWAY- THAT'S BEEN THE BIG ROLE OF GOVERNMENT I GUESS
I MEAN  GENERALLY
YEAH
YEAH
WELL
YEAH THAT'S KIND OF A DIFFICULT ONE TO GO INTO I MEAN THAT THAT PARTICULAR CASE
BECAUSE I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT UH I MEAN THEY COULD REQUIRE O- YOU KNOW
O- OBLIGATORY AIDS TESTING FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE I'M S- YOU KNOW THERE'S A HUGE PART OF THE POPULATION NOT A HUGE PART BUT A YOU KNOW THE THE AIDS POPULATION I GUESS THAT HAVE IT THAT DON'T KNOW THEY DO
AN- ARE SPREADING IT
BUT AGAIN TO REQUIRE YOU KNOW SUCH A TEST AND JUS- AND THEN TO MAKE MAKE IT KNOWN THEY HAVE IT IS TO SUBJECT THEM TO TO DISCRIMI- DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES
AND OTHER THINGS
I DON'T KNOW UH I DON'T KNOW HOW EXACTLY I FEEL ABOUT THAT
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL WHAT ABOUT THE REQUIRED DRUG TESTING UH AS A UH CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT
IT  A SUBTLE THING ACTUALLY UM
I UH HAVE WORKED AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
AND UH THEY INSTITUTED A DRUG POLICY THERE DRUG TESTING POLICY WHERE THEY RANDOMLY WOULD TEST UH EMPLOYEES
AND ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I REALLY DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT I I HADN'T YOU KNOW IT REALLY DIDN'T RELATE TO ME BUT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT PEOPLE
BROUGHT UP LIKE WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY THEY GET A FALSE POSITIVE YOU KNOW WHAT RECOURSE DO YOU HAVE
AND
ALSO UM
UH THIS IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS KIND OF THING THIS KIND OF BIG BROTHER ACTIVITY AND YET UH
A LOT OF THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS SUCH AS TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T ADMIT TO IT IT'S ACTUALLY
OH A DRUG TESTING POLICY COMES ABOUT AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT PRESSURE
SO
WHAT THAT MEANS IS TO ME THAT REALLY IT'S THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S REQUIRING THIS ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T ACTUALLY E- EXECUTE IT THEMSELVES IT'S REALLY THE GOVERNMENT'S THAT SO IN THAT SENSE A- AT LEAST UH
PHILOSOPHICALLY IT'S REALLY BORDERLINE LEGAL
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS UH AIDS EPIDEMIC NOW WHERE YOU FIND THAT UH
UH YOU KNOW CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ARE ARE CRIMINAL IN THEIR DISREGARD FOR
OTHERS YEAH AND
AND UH OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION IS TO OPERATE ON THEIR BRAIN SO THAT IT DOESN'T GET UH
IT DESTROYS THEIR LIBIDO
NOW UH YOU KNOW IF THEY EVER
SO WHAT ABOUT THAT AS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY
YEAH
SO REALLY IT I- GETS TO BALANCING UH PERSONAL FREEDOM AGAINST
UH THE GENERAL WELFARE
OF SOCIETY
WELL ARE IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN
NOW IT
A GROWING PART
UM-HUM
MAYBE CHOP THEIR WEENIES OFF
OKAY LET'S SEE DO YOU LIVE UH DO YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT UH
HAS BEEN AFFECTED RECENTLY BY ANY UH CRIMES
YEAH WE UH IN
PORTLAND IS IS
PRETTY UH HOW SHALL I SAY IT
THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE CON- CONFINED TO LOW INCOME NEIGH- WELL I SHOULDN'T SAY LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS UH
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE A LOT OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES LIVE AND AND UH WHERE THERE'S L- A LOT OF DRUG AND UH BROKEN FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
UH THAT DOESN'T
I- I
TRY TO UH IN MY THINKING
TO KEEP FROM BLAMING IT ON THE ON THE NATIONALITY OF PEOPLE AND MORE BLAME IT ON THE CULTURE OF THE UH YOU KNOW BROKEN FAMILIES AND AND UH DRUGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YES THE GANG PROBLEMS
THE THE P-
OH MY GOODNESS
TOO MANY HORMONES HUH
TOO MUCH ALCOHOL
YEAH JUST KIND OF A PSYCHOPATH
THE THE CRIME PROBLEM IS UH
I DON'T KNOW IF IF YOU'RE
THIS IS UH ABOUT A FOUR HOUR TOPIC BUT A FIVE MINUTE UH WINDOW HERE SO THE FOR ME I
FEEL VERY BAD ABOUT UH
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED UH THE PEOPLE IN THE CRIME RIDDEN AREAS ARE
MORE INNOCENT IN SOME CASES UH
THAN THE THAN THE PRESS F- WELL WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO SAY IS THEY ARE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO WORK VERY HARD AND ARE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THAT AND UH SO EVEN THOUGH I SEE
UH HOW SHALL I SAY IT UH THE PROBLEMS OF CRIME AFFECT THE BLACK WORKING CLASS AND UH MINORITY WORKING PEOPLE
MUCH WORSE THAN THEY AFFECT ME UH SO THE THE CRIME PROBLEM HAS TO BE SOLVED ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I SEE IS THAT
AND THEY ALWAYS COMPARE  UH AMERICA THEY SAY WELL IN AMERICA WE HAVE UH YOU KNOW A GUN PROBLEM AND UH UH THAT
I- I READ A DISCUSSION ONCE OF OF UH THE REASON WHY ENGLAND FOR INSTANCE UH HAS THEIR GUN PROBLEMS AND OTHER PROBLEMS ARE SO LOW AND IT BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TO THEY DON'T HAVE
THE BILL OF RIGHTS DOESN'T EXIT FOR THOSE GUYS IF YOU ARE STANDING AT A CORNER AND SOMEBODY AND THE BOBBY WALKS UP TO YOU AND HE SAYS YOU'VE BEEN STANDING HERE FOUR BUSES HAVE GONE BY UH YOU'RE A PICKPOCKET EMPTY YOUR POCKETS
IF HE FINDS SOME THINGS IN IN THERE THEN THEY WILL PROCEED TO YOUR HOUSE PERHAPS AND UH SAY OPEN YOUR DOOR UP AND GO IN AND SEARCH YOUR HOUSE AND AFTER THAT THEY CAN ENTER AT ANY TIME
NOW THAT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF UH WEEDING OUT HOW SHALL I SAY IT OF GETTING RID OF THE DANDELIONS BEFORE THEY'VE BEFORE THEY UH POPULATE YOUR LAWN
BUT  IT IT JUST DOESN'T FUNCTION IN OUR COURT SYSTEM OVER HERE WE WE WON'T ALLOW YOU TO BE UH FRISKED BY A COP UH WITHOUT GOOD REASON
YEAH AN AC-
THAT'S RIGHT AND AND LIKE I MY EARLIER EXAMPLE UH
UH I COULD SPEND
EVERY DAY ALL DAY JUST PICKING THE HEADS OFF OF DANDELIONS UH ONCE I LET MY LAWN GET INFESTED
UH
UH LET ME SEE NOT RECENTLY I WE'RE FRAMINGHAM IS UH MIDWAY BETWEEN BOSTON AND WORCESTER AND IT'S MOSTLY MOSTLY IN BOSTON THAT WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF PROBLEMS
UM BASICALLY IT'S LINED UP BLACKS VERSUS WHITES AND THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF MURDERS AND MOSTLY BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND TYPE OF THING
UM-HUM
RIGHT I THINK DRUGS PLAYS A REALLY BIG PART A LOT OF TIMES IT DOESN'T COME OUT IN THE PAPER OR ON THE NEWS
UM YOU KNOW THEY'RE MORE INTO AS FAR AS THE NEWS REPORTERS INTO OH YOU KNOW TWO BLACK GUYS KILLED EACH OTHER OR THEY KNIFED EACH OTHER OTHER TO DEATH AND WE HAVE A LOT WITH UH GANG PROBLEMS
YEAH THA-
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MAJOR THING AND WE JUST RECENTLY WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THERE ARE IN BOSTON WE DID HAVE I WAS THINKING WE DID HAVE ONE CRIME IN FRAMINGHAM WHERE A GIRL PICKED UP A GUY AT A BAR
AND UH HER KIDS WOKE UP SHE BROUGHT HIM HOME AND HER KIDS WOKE UP AND SHE WAS DEAD SHE HAD BEEN KNIFED TO DEATH
AND HE WAS A HOMELESS PERSON BUT WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO BRING SOMEBODY LIKE THAT HOME YOU KNOW
REALLY  I THINK THAT WAS TH- THE MAJOR PART OF IT TOO MUCH ALCOHOL AND SHE JUST INVITED HIM IN AND HE WAITED UNTIL SHE WAS SLEEPING AND THEN LET HER HAVE IT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM RIGHT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
HM
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WR- I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE LAW HAS GOT TO CHANGE BECAUSE THEY'VE FOUND UH HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE WE READ ABOUT OR HEARD ABOUT IN THE NATIONAL NEWS THAT HAVE BEEN PICKED UP AND BECAUSE OF A TECHNICALITY THEY'RE LEFT LET OFF
YOU KNOW AND THAT'S REALLY NOT RIGHT AND THEN THEY GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
RIGHT
UM NO I HAVEN'T BUT IN MY JOB I'M A NURSE AND WE ARE ALLOWED TO BE I MEAN YOU KNOW THIS IS THE RULES THAT THEY CAN DO THIS
ANYTIME UH I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO EVER HAS BEEN PICKED OUT
AND BEEN TESTED
THEY CAN IF THEY CHOOSE TO RIGHT
HAVE YOU WELL WH- HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH IT AT ALL
UH-HUH
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
RIGHT RIGHT SEE I KNOW OF THAT TOO
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE ANTIHISTAMINES SUDAFED THINGS LIKE THAT CAN REALLY THROW IT OFF AND YOU CANNOT GET A JOB
BECAUSE OF IT AND THEY MAY NOT TELL YOU THE REASON WHY
UH-HUH
SEE AND SO IT REALLY IS A DANGEROUS THING THAT WAY BECAUSE I KNOW OF SOMEBODY THAT TESTED FOR AN AIRLINE AND DIDN'T GET THE JOB AND
THEY WEREN'T TOLD WHY
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE REASON WHY AFTER YOU TAKE A PHYSICAL WILL BE BECAUSE OF THE DRUG TESTING
OR THEY WOULD TELL YOU OR THIS PERSON NEVER USE ANY DRUGS
UM YOU SHOULD BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE OR AT LEAST
ABLE TO JUSTIFY IT OR SOMETHING I HAVE REAL MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW
THE ACCURACY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN INFLUENCE THEM AND I THINK THAT A PERSON DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE WITH IT OR SOMETHING BECAUSE MOST THINGS WILL STAY IN YOUR SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME
AND IF YOU COULD SHOW THAT I- I INTERVIEWED FOR A JOB RECENTLY AND I WAS TAKING ENTEX
AND MY DOCTOR GAVE ME A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT AND HE SAID THIS WAY IF IT WERE TO MAKE THE DRUG TEST POSITIVE YOU HAVE
PROOF THAT YOUR DOCTOR ORDERED THIS FOR YOU YOU KNOW AND IT DIDN'T COME UP THAT I NEEDED TO DO IT BUT
IF THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AND IF THEY WOULD JUST SAY OH THIS PERSON'S DRUG TEST IS POSITIVE WE WON'T HIRE THEM
YOU KNOW THEN YOU COULD LOSE OUT ON A JOB WHEN REALLY YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
SO I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I'M NOT SURE EITHER THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE IT IS THAT IF THEY REALLY SUSPECT A PERSON OF USING IT
THEN THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND PROVE IT BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY CAN SPOT CHECK
YEAH
WELL IT SORT OF IS AND THIS IS IT THIS I'M NOT REAL SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT
FROM TWO WAYS YOU KNOW AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL I WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY TAKE CARE OF ME THAT WAS USING DRUGS
YOU KNOW SO AS A PATIENT I FEEL WELL YEAH WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE PROTECTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
I SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM IT THEY DON'T TEST MY PATIENTS FOR TOO SO YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU SORT OF YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRUST SOME PLACE ALONG THE WAY
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND TESTING EVERYBODY FOR EVERYTHING
SO I DON'T KNOW AND I- I THINK IT COULD BE USED TO HASSLE SOMEBODY IF SOMEONE WAS OUT TO GET YOU
I THINK THAT A COMPANY OR A BOSS COULD USE THIS YOU KNOW THEY COULD KEEP ON DOING THIS TO YOU OR SOMETHING I GUESS I CAN SEE WHERE IT COULD BECOME A PROBLEM
REALLY
OH WOW
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING YOU DID SEVERAL YEARS AGO
THAT'S THE OTHER THING I MEAN A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AS KIDS OR YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE GET INTO SOME THINGS THAT
THEY GET OUT OF LATER ON AND I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD REALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT FOREVER
SO
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH SO THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TOO GOOD EITHER
UH HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TESTED FOR A NEW JOB OR ANYTHING
SO IT'S JUST SORT OF UM THEY CAN IF THEY
Y- OH OKAY
UM NOT REALLY BUT I'VE ALWAYS WORKED ON A UNIVERSITY LEVEL BUT A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAD TO BE TESTED BEFORE THEY GOT SUMMER JOBS AND STUFF
UM I DON'T
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY ACCURATE BECAUSE I MEAN I KNOW THEIR LIFESTYLES CHANGED P- PRIOR TO THE DRUG TEST AND I KNOW THEY CHANGED AFTERWARDS
YEAH I- I HAD A FRIEND
IT DIDN'T CAUSE HER ANY PROBLEMS WITH HER JOB BUT IT CAME BACK THAT SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR USING A HALLUCINOGEN
BUT WHAT IT WAS WAS SHE HAD BEEN U- SHE HAD BEEN UM IN THE JUNGLE AND IT WAS SOME MALARIA MEDICATION AND SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THAT
SEE I ALWAYS I THOUGHT THEY GOT YOU GOT CALLED BACK IF YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR MORE TEST
HOW UH DO YOU KNOW HOW WRONG THEY ARE ARE THEY I MEAN IS THERE A MARGIN OF ERROR
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH AND I I'M NOT SO SURE THEY'RE THAT NEEDED I MEAN
YE- IF YOU'RE USING IT
WHILE AT A JOB I CAN SEE A PROBLEM BUT THE OCCASIONAL PERSON THEN IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S ALMOST AN INFRINGEMENT OF YOUR PRIVACY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT IT'S LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE NOW THEY HAVE TRESTS I GUESS THEY CAN TEST YOUR HAIR AND THEY CAN FIND OUT IF YOU USE DRUGS UP TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO
SO
I KNOW
YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU DO AS A KID THAT YOU WOULDN'T DO AS AN ADULT BUT
YOU CAN'T SAY IT WAS WRONG AT THE TIME
UH DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR UM IDEAS ABOUT OUR FUNDING OF AIDS RESEARCH
DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN CANCER OR SOMETHING ELSE SIMPLY BECAUSE TH- THE NUMBERS ARE SO LARGE
OKAY
BECAUSE MY THOUGHT LEADS TO YOU KNOW I HAVE UH SCHOOL AGE KIDS
UH I THINK A A A GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY OUGHT TO GO TO THE EDUCATION WHICH THEY THEY D- SEEM TO BE DOING
UH BECAUSE I THINK YOU WANT TO STOP IT BEFORE IT GETS T- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU CAN REVERSE IF YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT BEFORE IT STARTS
SOMETHING IN- INSIDE ME UPSETS ME TO THINK THAT THERE'RE THERE'RE LOTS OF DISEASES IN IN MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY THERE'S A GENETIC DISEASE
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE MAKING A STINK ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW AND CURING YOU KNOW MAKING THIS GUNG HO RALLY TO CURE THAT
IT'S A SCARE ALSO
OH I'M SURE IT'S DEVASTATING
A- AND THERE THERE IS A REAL S- SCARE A REAL FEAR YOU DON'T KNOW
YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT COULD BE I HAD ANSWERED A UH JOB AD F- WE HAVE A LOCAL VA HOSPITAL DOWN HERE
AND THEY S- THEY NEEDED A LAB ASSISTANT AND I'M WORKING PART-TIME NOW I'M A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
UH BUT YOU KNOW I GET CALLED SPORADICALLY AND THEY NEEDED THIS LAB ASSISTANCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCE I'M REALLY AN ARTIST BUT I FIGURED OH YOU KNOW I'LL FIND OUT WHAT IT IS
AND SHE SHE VERY CASUALLY SAID WELL THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE LAB ANIMALS AND BLAH BLAH BLAH AND TH-
UM YOU MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO AIDS IN THE ANIMALS BUT YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE GLOVES AND THIS AND THAT AND IT DID MAKE ME FLINCH IT DID MAKE ME NOT WANT TO DO THAT
IMAGINE HOW THEY FEEL
RIGHT
SURE BUT I GE- YOU KNOW THESE THESE WERE LAB ANIMALS I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT RATS TO BEGIN WITH I MEAN BUT HERE'S HUMANS AND YOU CAN FEEL COMPASSION FOR THEM
OH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I GUESS IT PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE IT'S A JOB AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE A SALARY BUT
UH-HUH
HM
THE CARE IS SHODDY
RIGHT YEAH HOW CAN YOU FEEL WHEN THERE'S A SIGN ON YOUR DOOR YOU KNOW I IS IT
THERE THERE'S USUALLY A SIGN ON THE DOOR SAYING QUARANTINED OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW OR
SURE
I'M SURE A BIG PART OF IT IS UH THEY THEY SUFFER MENTALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY
YEAH YOU KNOW IT IT JUST WHEN I WHEN I SEE A HEADLINE THAT SAYS THAT WE'RE GIVING TWENTY FIVE BILLION TO RUSSIA BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO EAT BETTER AND THEN WE'VE GOT SO MANY PROBLEMS AT HOME
WHA- WHERE IS THIS YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND SAYS WELL THEY'RE PRINTING UP MORE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE WHERE IS IT COMING FROM DO THEY ASK US
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW WE COULD SPEND IT WHEN WE OWE SO MUCH I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK IT BALANCES YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU CAN'T SPEND IT BUT WE SEEM TO IT'S A MYSTERY
UH SO I GUESS YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK WE SHOULD SPEND MORE FOR AIDS RESEARCH
I'M NOT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WE ARE SPENDING ACTUALLY
WELL WELL I HATE TO THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW IT SEEMS THAT ANYTIME A BUREAUCRACY WORKS ON SOMETHING THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON ADMINISTRATION COSTS
AND A STUDY OF HOW TO DO THIS CAN COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
R- RIGHT UH
I IMAGINE
-KAY
YES
YES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UH
EITHER MAKE A SPECIAL TAX FOR IT OR IMPLEMENT THE MONEY TOWARD THAT AWAY FROM OTHER AREAS
IT'S GOING TO BE SUCH AN AMAZING
IN- INSURMOUNTABLE YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE COST IT'S GOING TO COST TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE
AN- AND IF THEY CAN FIND A RESOURCE OF COURSE THEY CAN CUT THE PAIN AND SUFFERING BUT IF ANYTHING THE COST
THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE A WELL FORTUNE JUST IMPLEMENTING THAT MONEY TOWARD THAT
YES I DO
OH WELL CANCER THE NUMBERS ARE LARGER
UM HOWEVER AIDS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME TO BECOME LARGER THAN CANCER WITHIN A VERY QUICK TIME
UM-HUM
UM-HUM I I AGREE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE SHEER NUMBERS I REALLY THINK IT'S THAT
IT IS
UH AIDS IS A MAJOR TOPIC RIGHT NOW IT'S TRENDY
IN THE NEWS IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW
BUT UNTIL YOU'VE REALLY WORKED WITH IT AND SEEN IT
THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IT IS IT IS
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
RIGHT
WELL I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I WORKED WITH AN AIDS PATIENT I WAS TERRIFIED I HAVE TO ADMIT IT
AND I KNOW EDUCATIONALLY WISE EVERYTHING I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW
AND IT STILL SCARED ME
THAT'S TRUE BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY NURSES DON'T
IT
I'M NOT KIDDING I
I I WORK IN A PUBLIC A COUNTY HOSPITAL AND UH WELL FIRST OF ALL MOST OF THOSE NURSES THERE ARE LVNS BECAUSE THE PAY IS BAD FOR THEM
AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE MANY RNS AND VERY FEW BSNS
SO
THE CARE IS SHODDY YES
UH THE COMPASSION IS LOW THE HOURS ARE LONG AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
SO THEY TEND TO ISOLATE THEM AND LEAVE THEM
FOR A LARGE AMOUNT
HUH
YES THEY'RE IN ISOLATION
THEY CERTAINLY ARE
THEY DEFINITELY DO THEY DEFINITELY DO
I KNOW
AND WE OUR DEBT I I'M JUST SO CONCERNED
I KNOW
WHERE ARE THEY SPENDING IT I KNOW
WH- WHO ARE I MEAN WHERE ARE THEY SPENDING THIS MONEY YOU KNOW
ME EITHER
UM-HUM
YES WE DO YES WE DO
UM I
UH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE SPENDING IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT TAKES TWENTY YEARS TO FIND ANYWAY OR FIFTY
OH I KNOW
INSTEAD OF JUST TRYING IT
I DON'T KNOW UM
-KAY SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS JOB BENEFITS AND SUCH
UH WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER
THAT YOU'RE LACKING IN BENEFITS THAT YOU HAVE
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL THAT'S I'VE UH WORKED FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE HAD HMO BEFORE AND IT REALLY IS NICE PARTICULARLY IF YOU AREN'T YOU KNOW REALLY SET ON A- ONE SPECIFIC DOCTOR IF IF YOU'RE FLEXIBLE

ABOUT UH TEN HOLIDAYS I GUESS ONE OF WHICH IS A FLOATING HOLIDAY THAT I CAN USE AT MY DISCRETION THE

I'M SORRY
UH THE VACATION I THINK I CAN SPLIT YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT TWO OR A WEEK AT A TIME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE HOLIDAY UH
THE THE ONE DAY I THINK I CAN JUST PUT IT ANYWHERE THAT I WANT TO
SO THAT'S NICE
THAT'S A BENEFIT NO WE DON'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I DON'T THINK SO AS A MATTER OF FACT I'VE ONLY BEEN WITH THE COMPANY A MONTH AND A HALF AND UH I I ASKED MY BOSS I THINK WE DO HAVE A CHRISTMAS PARTY ALTHOUGH HE INDICATED THE BUDGET IS KIND OF LOW
BUT THEN WITH JUST UH TEN OF US IN THE OFFICE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS A COMPANY PICNIC OR ANYTHING I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH OF US YOU KNOW TO TO GET TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT UH
UH THE OFFICE IS PRETTY FREE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS IF I DECIDE THAT I WANT TO GO OUT TO LUNCH WITH SOMEONE AND I'M LATE COMING BACK
NO ONE COMPLAINS OR SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND IF I NEED SOME TIME OFF TO GO TO A DOCTOR THEY WOULDN'T PENALIZE ME FOR THAT
AND THAT COUNTS
UM-HUM
RIGHT

RIGHT
THAT I'M LACKING IN BENEFITS UM THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT ALL PAID FOR
UM I WISH THEY WERE ALL PAID BENEFITS UH I SHARE IN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE UH HALF AND HALF
UM I'M ALSO COVERED UNDER MY WIFE'S SO BUT UH I WISH I WISH THEY WERE ALL PAID FOR I DON'T HAVE A A A DENTAL BENEFIT

YEAH
WELL I MEAN YOU GET YOU GET YEARLY PHYSICALS

I GUESS IN A PERFECT WORLD IN A PERFECT WORLD UH BUT WE AREN'T IN A PERFECT WORLD SO I DON'T KNOW
UH OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY BENEFITS PER SE HOW ABOUT YOURSELF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

GOTCHA
HUH
NOW WHEN YOU SAY A FLOATING HOLIDAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
OH OKAY YEAH
SO YOU HAVE PERSONAL DAYS YOU DAY UH I SHOULD SAY MULTIPLE OR SINGLE

NOW DOES
D- OH YEAH UH D- DOES YOUR COMPANY DO PICNICS OR YOU KNOW LIKE UH TOMORROW OUR COMPANY AS A WHOLE AND I GUESS I WOULD CALL THIS A BENEFIT  IS UH WE'RE GOING TO THE RED SOX HOME OPENER IN UH BOSTON
YEAH
YEA- YOU DON'T DO YOU HAVE ANY LIKE COMPANY PICNICS OR UH OR GET-TOGETHERS OR THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES
OH
IT ALWAY- IT USUALLY IS
HUH
THAT'S GOOD I WAS YEAH OH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE ENVIRONMENT YOU WORK IN IS IS UH CRUCIAL TO THE JOB
UH WE HAVE SOMEWHAT WE'RE SOMEWHAT IN THE SAME SITUATION UM I MEAN I FEEL I FEEL ODD ABOUT TAKING ANY PERSONAL TIME ANYWAY UNLESS YOU KNOW THEY KNEW ABOUT IT OR WHATEVER BUT UM
BUT BEING A SALES ORGANIZATION WE YOU KNOW OUR TIME IS OUR OWN I MEAN WE'RE KIND OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS UNDER A COMMON GOAL TYPE OF THING
SO IT'S KIND OF THE SAME SITUATION ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR OFFICE STRUCTURE IS MORE STRUCTURED AS AN OFFICE TIME
UM BUT YOU IT'S NOT SO RIGID THAT YOU KNOW YOU PUNCH A CLOCK THAT TYPE OF THING
I WENT
I TURNED MINE IN ABOUT TWELVE HOURS EARLY AT NOON
ARE YOU EATING
NO IT'S O-
SAY WHAT
TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO IS UH I CAN PUNCH THE UH ONE THEN WE AFTER FIVE MINUTES WHEN THE UH UH VOICE COMES ON WE CAN TALK ALL NIGHT IF WE WANT
UH I LOVE THE IRONY OF UH
TALKING ABOUT THIS SUBJECT ON APRIL THE FIFTEENTH
BUT UM I'M AFRAID I'M I- I'M PROBABLY IN THE MINORITY I- I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE UH PAY TOO MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY
UM UM PARTICULARLY UH IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WH- UM I GUESS
I DO HAVE A UH A BONE TO PICK WITH UM UH THE WAY TAXES ARE DISTRIBUTED
UM I JUST FINISHED FUMING AT THE FACT THAT WE PAY AN EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT SALES TAX AND NO INCOME TAX WHEN THE INCOME TAX COULD HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM A FEDERAL FORM
AND THE SALES TAX CAN'T I THINK THAT'S REGRESSIVE AND UH
UM
IT'S KIND OF DUMB
WELL I MEAN NOBODY TAXES GROCERIES DO THEY WHERE
IS THAT RIGHT
RIGHT IT'S
RIGHT
BUT I GUESS WHEN I HEAR WHE- WHEN I SEE THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND UH ANY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY
UH THEIR THEIR RATES ARE LIKE UH FORTY ONE FORTY TWO AND OURS ARE LIKE THIRTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN
YOU KNOW IF YOU COMPUTE IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL INCOME ALL TAXES LUMPED TOGETHER WE ACTUALLY DO PRETTY WELL
TH- TH- THERE'S NO OTHER COUNTRY THAT'S THAT IS TAXED AS LOW AS WE ARE
YEAH
UH-HUH
I'M I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN
RIGHT
OH YOU MEAN LOWEST END OF LIVING IN SPITE OF LOW- HIGHER UH YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE YEAH UM PROBABLY MO- LESS SO NOW THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR WHENEVER BUT
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH SINCE UH
I SEND MY KIDS TO PAROCHIAL SCHOOL THAT'S UH
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT QUITE THE BARGAIN THAT A GUY WOULD THINK
BUT I MEAN I PAY THEM GLADLY THAT'S A DECISION I THINK IT'S A DUMB DECISION ON OUR PART BECAUSE
COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA AND ENGLAND AND GERMANY DO PERFECTLY WELL WITH A UH TWO TRACT SYSTEM IN WHICH RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS COEXIST WITH SECULAR SCHOOLS FOR THE WITH THE SAME TAX MONEY
BUT UH I MEAN THAT'S UH THAT'S THE WAY THE AMERICANS WANT TO INTERPRET IT I GUESS THAT'S ALL RIGHT
BUT YEAH I AND IF I WERE UH WHEN I WAS SINGLE AND AGAIN WHEN I'M RETIRED I WILL NOT MIND PAYING UH WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP THE SCHOOLS GOOD THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY YOU KNOW
I DO THI- YEAH THAT'S TRUE I THINK IN PLACES I THINK IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO FIND THAT IN IN AREAS THAT ARE FAIRLY WELL OFF
IF YOU ADD THE UM UH PEOPLE OF VARIOUS SEXUAL PERSUASIONS AND THOSE WHO NEVER INTEND TO MARRY AND THOSE WHO ARE RETIRED AND THOSE WHO ARE UM JUST LOOKING FOR FUN THE- PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A SMALL MINORITY THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE TAX BILL PASSED NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
AND UH  THERE ARE BIG SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE ARE SUCH A SMALL MINORITY THAT THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT SEEMS UM
UM LIKE A CULTURAL LAPSE I MEAN PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS USED TO BE WILLING TO ANTE UP FOR THE SCHOOLS THEY
RIGHT YEAH PEOPLE WOULD RATHER UM INCREASE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND CUT DOWN THE SCHOOLS  BECAUSE IT MEANS MORE TO THEM
BUT I THINK IT'S SAD
SELFISH AND SHORTSIGHTED YEAH
WELL
NOT VERY GOOD IT'S NOT BEEN A GOOD DAY
I DON'T KNOW I FINISHED MINE UP ABOUT ELEVEN AND LEFT IT HERE WITH CAROLYN SO I HOPE SHE'S TURNED IT IN
I JU-  GO AHEAD I'LL STOP EATING I JUST BARELY GOT HOME FROM THE UNIVERSITY I JUST BARELY GOT HOME FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OKAY GO AHEAD
FIRE AWAY
I AGREE WITH YOU
I HATE THE EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT SALES TAX BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T MIND THAT IT'S ONLY ON
YOU KNOW THINGS THAT AREN'T
LIKE  GROCERIES AND THAT IT'S NOT ON THEM
OH YEAH THEY DO
IN ARIZONA
UM-HUM
WE HAVE A PRETTY LOW INCOME TA- I MEAN PRETTY LOW TAX RATE HERE OH I THINK THA- THE SALES TAX THEY JUST GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
BUT THAT'S THE POLITICALNESS OF TRYING TO NOT CREATE ANY NEW TAXES
WELL AND I STILL THINK HAVING LIVED IN EUROPE FOR AWHILE YOU KNOW  THE DIFFERENCE IN LIVING CONDITIONS ARE CERTAINLY WELL WORTH UH WHAT WE PAY FOR IT
WELL I MEAN I THINK I WAS IN GERMANY YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS
AND I'D A LOT RATHER PAY TAXES HERE AND HAVE WHAT WE HAVE THAN HAVE TO LIVE THERE
HIGHER TAXES YEAH
STILL IS THAT WAY TO SOME EXTENT
I THINK THE OTHER PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S EASY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TAXES BECAUSE THEY'RE SOMETHING YOU THEORETICALLY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT
BUT I LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU YOU'RE NOT IN THE QUITE IN THE SAME SITUATION BUT LIKE SCHOOL TAXES FOR ME BIGGEST BARGAIN IN THE WORLD I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY  ANY MORE FO- FO- TO MY PHYSICIANS IN A YEAR THAN I HAD TO PAY FOR ALL OF MY SCHOOL TAXES
YEAH THAT THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE TOUGHER ON YOU
NO I THINK THAT'S JUST YOU THOUGH
YEAH
OF COURSE I THINK WITH THE GRAYING OF AMERICA WE'RE GONNA SEE THAT PROBLEM IN LOTS OF PLACES
OR BUILD ROADS
UM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT UH I WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME AND UH
IN FACT UH I'LL BE LEAVING VERY SHORTLY TO GO TO WORK AND I WORK DIFFERENT SHIFTS SO ARE PRETTY MUCH A
A LATER SHIFT TO WHERE I DON'T HAVE THE FAMILY TIME UH WHEN MY HUSBAND GETS HOME IT'S USUALLY HE'S HOME WITH MY DAUGHTER ALONE AND THEN UH COUPLE OF HOURS LATER I'M HOME
UM I DON'T KNOW I'M FINDING THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE THAT I TALK TO THERE'S LESS AND LESS FAMILY TIME AVAILABLE TO THEM AND UH IT SEEMS THAT BUSINESS WISE UM
IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY OR YOUR EMPLOYERS SEEM TO BE TAKING MORE AND MORE TIME AWAY FROM THE FAMILY
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU DO HAVE ANY TIME IT'S KIND OF LIKE ON A RUSH CYCLE THAT YOU HAVE TO GET SO MANY OTHER THINGS DONE
UM JUS- JUST TO MAINTAIN YOUR HOME AND MAINTAIN THE THINGS OUTSIDE YOUR HOME AND THEN PLUS TRY TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR CHILDREN
AND IT IT'S SOMETIMES A VERY IT'S A IT'S A VERY HARD JUGGLING ACT
AND
YOU KNOW I LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER AND SHE'S NOW UH FOUR GOING TO BE FOUR AND I KEEP SAYING OH JEEZ I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME WITH HER
AND SHE'S GROWING FAST AND
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
SURE EXACT-
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
SURE
UM-HUM EXACTLY
UM-HUM
SURE SURE
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
SURE
SURE
SURE YEAH I AGREE TO A
I THINK SO TOO
IN FACT UM I SPENT THE FIRST THREE YEARS AT HOME WITH MY DAUGHTER SO I- I GUESS I FELT FAIRLY FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT AND I DID NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE OF INFANTS BEING PLACED IN DAY CARE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HOW CAN A MOTHER
PLACE HER CHILD AT THE AGE OF SIX WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS OR TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS WHATEVER THE EMPLOYER SAYS YOU HAVE TO BE BACK TO WORK IS BASICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE BACK TO WORK WHETHER IT BE SIX WEEKS OR THREE OR FOUR BUT HOW THESE WOMEN MUST
FEEL TO PLACE THEIR CHILDREN INTO CARE AND YOU KNOW IT'S OUR SOCIETY SAYING YES THIS UM YOU NEED THIS JOB
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FINANCIAL TYPE THING BECAUSE UH IF YOU LOOK ALL OVER IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE EUROPE AND THAT UM THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING ARE A LOT LESS THAN WHAT OURS ARE AND THAT'S PART OF IT TOO BUT
UH LIKE MY HUSBAND WAS SAYING MAYBE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE BROUGHT ON TO OURSELVES IS THAT THESE WOMEN BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES UH WERE STAYING AT HOME WITH THEIR KIDS
AND THEN MADE THE DECISION WELL JEEZ YOU KNOW I'LL GO OUT AND GET A PART TIME JOB GOT A PART TIME JOB AND THEN FINANCIALLY THEY GOT THEMSELVES INTO WELL I'LL HAVE THE BOAT I'LL HAVE THE CAR AND IT'S NICE
AND REALLY WOMEN PAST GENERATION WOMEN HAVE DONE IT TO WOMEN OF THIS DAY AND AGE TOO
UH BECAUSE IT IS NOW OUR FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE AS
IT ALMOST TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO BRING IN AN INCOME TO SUPPORT A FAMILY NOW AND
UM-HUM
SURE I DID IT FOR THREE YEARS AND UH IT COST US A LOT OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS DOING IT
AND PRETTY SOON YOU KNOW YOU'RE AT THE LIMIT WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO SAY OKAY YOU'VE SACRIFICED FOR YOU KNOW SO MANY YEARS AT HOME AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY FURTHER YOU KNOW ALONG
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO BACK TO WORK PART TIME OR GO BACK TO WORK FULL TIME AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IT'S A TOUGH ONE AND I
UM-HUM
SURE
I AGREE
YEAH
I KNOW THAT I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND UM I STAY HOME I DON'T WORK
AND UM I KNOW THAT IT IT MUST BE REALLY CHALLENGING TO UM TRY TO JUGGLE A JOB AND AND ALSO YOUR CHILDREN BECAUSE I KNOW MY HUSBAND IF I WERE GONE AS MUCH AS HE IS
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE INFLUENCE ON THEM THAT I WOULD WANNA PUT ON THEM
AND I ALSO NOTICE THAT THE CHILDREN THAT COME OVER HERE TO PLAY THAT GO TO DAY CARE EVERY DAY
THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE AROUND ADULTS
THEY DON'T WANNA PLAY AROUND ADULTS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND YOU THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO THEY WANT TO DO THEIR OWN THING AND THEY'RE THE VERY SAME AGE AS MY CHILDREN
AND I'M FINDING AS I VOLUNTEER UP AT THE SCHOOL
I JUST A BEING UM I'M NOT EDUCATED AT ALL IN UM REALLY DETECTING THIS BUT I CAN TALK TO THE TEACHER AND TELL THEM ON A PRETTY GOOD BASIS AFTER I'VE WORKED UP AT THE SCHOOL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHICH KIDS GO TO DAY CARE AND WHICH KIDS STAY HOME
AND YOU CAN JUST TELL IN THEIR PERSONALITIES AND HOW THEY RESPOND TO THE ADULTS
THAT UM THE ONES THAT ARE ARE HOME AND THE ONES EVEN THAT ARE HOME THAT ARE GETTING THE LOVE AND ATTENTION THEY NEED
NOT THAT THE KIDS THAT GO OUT AREN'T GETTING THAT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT THEY'RE THEY ARE MORE USED TO BEING WITH THEIR OWN AGE KIDS THEY'RE NOT USE TO BEING WITH ADULTS AND TO RESPONDING TO ADULTS
UM I THINK THE TREND IN THE UNITED STATES I FEEL REALLY BAD THAT IT'S TURNED SO MUCH TO WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE UM
RIGHT
RIGHT
IT'S HARD IT REALLY IS HARD I KNOW THAT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE TO DO A LOT OF SACRIFICING TO KEEP ME HOME AND UM
RIGHT
RIGHT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT TOO THOUGH IS UM SPEN- HOW THEY SPEND THEIR TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN
I THINK WITH WORKING MOMS IF YOU CAN GET THE MA- THE BOSSES TO GIVE YOU ALMOST LIKE A ROTATION LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH YEAR ROUND SCHOOL WHERE YOU WORK
OKAY UM I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THIS SITUATION YET
YOU KNOW MY MY PARENTS ARE NOT QUITE AT THAT AGE YET SO I HAVEN'T
NO SO I HAVEN'T UH REALLY BEEN IN THAT SITUATION ALTHOUGH THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER BUT UM
THAT'S REALLY ABOUT IT HOW ABOUT YOU HAVE YOU BEEN IN THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE HAD TO
UH-HUH
DID IT REALLY
YEAH
OH NO THAT'S SAD
YEAH
OH OKAY
ARE SURE THEY WERE
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH
YEAH
OH
HUH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
AND I'M SURE IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MY MY GRANDMOTHER IS NOT IN A NURSING HOME BUT SHE'S IN A  OH THEY'RE LIKE UM THEY'RE APARTMENTS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS
AND SHE LOVES THAT BECAUSE I- I- THEY ARRANGE ACTIVITIES FOR THEM ALL DAY LONG AND THEN THEY HAVE UM WHERE THE BUS PICKS THEM UP AND TAKES THEM WHERE THEY NEED TO GO
AND SHE SHE SHE REALLY DOES LOVE THAT BUT SHE'S JUST CONCERNED ABOUT
I-
IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW SHE SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT GONNA BE LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME AND SHE'S JUST WONDERING WELL WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME AND AND I YOU KNOW IT'S I GUESS IT'S SO NORMAL TO START TO WONDER ABOUT THAT EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T NEED THAT BUT
YOU KNOW SHE'S KIND OF ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WELL WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN YOU KNOW THIS CAN'T LAST FOREVER AND
SO
YEAH I-
YEAH SHE CAN BUT I- I THINK IT IS ALSO CAFETERIA STYLE BECAUSE I- I REALLY I- I- I DOUBT IF SHE RARELY COOKS FOR HERSELF
SO UH
BECAUSE I- I REMEMBER HER IN HER LETTERS TELLING ME SHE SHE'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR COFFEE OR SOMETHING TO EAT SO I'M ASSUMING IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT TOO SO
SO
UM-HUM
YEAH YEAH
UM-HUM AND SHE LIVES BY HERSELF TOO SHE SEEMS TO LIKE IT AND UM MY HUSBAND'S GRANDMOTHER IS
WELL SHE LIVES SHE LIVES IN A HOUSE ON HER OWN AND SHE DOESN'T REALLY NEED THE CARE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT SHE HAS HER OWN HOME AND SH- AND SHE'S DOING REALLY WELL I'M REALLY PROUD OF HER SHE'S DOING REALLY WELL
SO
WE HAVEN'T HAD TO DO ANYTHING BUT THEN AGAIN SHE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT SO I MEAN SHE'S GOT HER MOTHER IN TOWN TOO AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO HOPEFULLY WE WON'T NEED TO GO THAT ROUTE
YEAH
THAT'S NOT QUITE ELDERLY HUH
UH-HUH
UM NOT FOR MY PARENTS BUT I- I WAS AROUND UH TWO SETS OF GRANDPARENTS
UM QUITE A BIT WE WE PUT ONE I PUT ONE GRANDFATHER IN A REST HOME
AND
THAT KILLED HIM  WELL YEAH KIND OF WELL THERE WAS SOME OTHER THINGS INVOLVED BUT IT BEFORE HE WAS REALLY ACTIVE AND
THE THERE WAS SOME YOU KNOW HE LO- LOST HIS DRIVERS LICENSE AND UH COULDN'T GET AROUND AND WASN'T ABLE TO DO SOME THINGS AND SO WE ENDED UP JUST HAVING TO PUT HIM IN A REST HOME
AND HE JUST KIND OF BECAME A VEGETABLE AND DIED
SO BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS UH BACK IN LIKE SEVENTY THREE
SO UM I THINK THE WAY THEY DID THINGS WERE A LOT DIFFERENT BACK THEN
AND UH
MY GRANDMOTHER HIS HIS WIFE UH WE ALSO PUT HER IN A REST HOME SHE WAS IN A REST HOME AND THEN SHE WAS BACK OUT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO BE THERE
AND UH HAD A PHYSICAL HAD A GOOD PHYSICAL THERAPIST AT THAT PLACE
AND THEY WORKED WITH HER AND
GOT HER WALKING AND GOT HER TA- KIND OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF AND SO SHE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK HOME
AND THEN SHE HAD TO GO BACK IN A COUPLE OF TIMES
BUT MOSTLY IT WAS JUST BECAUSE SHE KIND OF GAVE UP
AND THEY GOT HER GOING AGAIN
SO I GUESS AS FAR AS LOOKING AND I SAID THE AS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR AN ACTIVE
UH
INTERACTIVE STAFF
SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO WORK WITH UH YOU KNOW WORK WITH A PATIENTS AND DO DO THINGS WITH THEM AND TREAT THEM TREAT THEM LIKE THAT
IT IT IS
IT IS EXPENSIVE
UH-HUH
OH UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
WHEN SHE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
UM-HUM NOW TH-
UH-HUH
DOES SHE HAVE A IS IT LIKE A KITCHENETTE TYPE APARTMENT WHERE SHE CAN FIX HER OWN FOOD IF SHE WANTS TO OR SHE CAN GO DOWN TO THE CAFETERIA
UH-HUH
FACT I
UH-HUH
YEAH I- I REALLY LIKE THAT CONCEPT THEY'VE THEY HAVE A FEW OF THOSE WELL QUITE A FEW OF THOSE PLACES LIKE THAT HERE IN UTAH AND UH YOU KNOW I
COUPLES CAN YOU KNOW HUSBAND AND WIFE CAN CAN LIVE THERE TOO OR OR WHATEVER I AND AN- AND THEN AND YET THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS THE
YOU KNOW OF GETTING TOGETHER AND EATING TOGETHER AND ALL OF THAT
I- I THINK IT REALLY TAKES UM
Y- YOU KNOW LOOKING MORE AT THE PEOPLE THAN EVEN REALLY THE FACILITIES
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I- I THINK THAT THAT'S THE THING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT TOUGH ABOUT PUTTING THEM IN A REST HOME IS IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THEY SAY PUTTING THEM OUT TO PASTURE
AND SOME SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER WERE REALLY ACTIVE THEY THEY WANTED TO DO THINGS THEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T WANNA GO DOWN AND PLAY BINGO OR UM
YOU KNOW PLAY WITH THE YARN
START IT
OKAY UH BASICALLY I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND OUR HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN SEEMS TO BE OKAY BUT IT SEEMS THE BENEFITS ARE ARE ERODING AND THE COST OF INSURANCE GOES UP
UH I DON'T KNOW WHY THE POST PEOPLE POST OFFICE PEOPLE PAY ONE THIRD OUT OF THEIR PAYCHECK FOR THE SAME INSURANCE THAT WE'RE GETTING
UH RIGHT NOW I'M IN WE'RE PHYSICIANS HEALTH PLAN AND THAT COSTS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE BUCKS A PAYCHECK
BUT YET THE POSTAL PEOPLE WILL ONLY PAY LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS A PAYCHECK
YES PROBABLY YES FULL PAYMENT ONE PERCENT AND I'M SURE NOT EVERYBODY HAS THEY'RE PROBABLY GETTING THEIR  WORTH AND
MASTERCARD'S CHEAPER TOO
UM-HUM
GOSH YEAH THAT'S A STEEP ONE
UM-HUM
I AGREE THERE BECAUSE I YOU KNOW SATURDAY AFTERNOON YOU'RE PLAYING BASEBALL AND YOU BREAK YOUR ARM YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU FOR THE X-RAYS AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOME TYPE OF HEALTH PLAN THAT YOU CAN AFFORD
AND I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO WHERE THEY CANNOT  AND AFFORD FIFTY BUCKS EVERY PAYCHECK FOR A HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
AND I KNOW I AND WHEN I WAS IN GERMANY I WAS IN THE SERVICE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT THAT IF YOU WENT TO A HOSPITAL THERE IN GERMANY THAT THEY KNEW THEY COULD BILL UNCLE SAM FOR THAT HOSPITAL CARE
SO THEY DIDN'T GIVE US ANY HASSLE  MEDICAL CARE THERE
AND MY BROTHER AND MY DAD ARE OVER THERE AND IT'S A GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN FOR THEM
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO COST US MONEY AS FAR AS TAXES IF OUR GOVERNMENT GETS INTO IT BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVEN'T SHOWN A REAL GOOD RECORD FOR MANAGEMENT OF ANY KIND OF PROGRAM
I'M PRETTY IGNORANT ON TAXES BUT ON SELF-EMPLOYED DO YOU GET ANY KIND OF CREDITS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE
UM
YOU KNOW THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO PAY IN THE END NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS SO
COST HIDDEN OR NOT
SURE
IT'S CALLED THE UNION
WELL
I AM ALL FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE UM BEING UP HERE IN NEW YORK UM
OUR LOCAL BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD PEOPLE HAVE
I'M I'M NOW PAYING EVERY MONTH BECAUSE I'M SELF-EMPLOYED ONE HUNDRED AND THREE DOLLARS A MONTH
FOR BASIC HEALTH CARE COVERAGE
UM ACTUALLY I'M SORRY IT'S MORE THAN TH- WELL IT'S FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A QUARTER
SO IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT
AND
FRANKLY I DON'T I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKE WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN CANADA AND GIVEN EVERY BODY A CHOICE AS FAR AS WHO THEY WANT FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE
FRANKLY I THINK THAT THE REASON THAT WE'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE AND AND AND IT'S SUCH AN ANTICOMPETITIVE UM
UH STANCE RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS DOING BATTLE WITH THESE OTHER COMPANIES IS THAT WE ARE REALLY BURDENING OUR AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS WHICH THEY HAVE TO BUILD IN TO THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT
WHEREAS IF YOU GO TO SO- ONE OF THESE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES JAPAN FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT PAYS ALL OF THAT
THE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD THAT IN TO THE COST OF THE PRODUCT UM THEY USUALLY NAIL THE PR- YOU KNOW YOU PAY AS AS AN INDIVIDUAL
VERSUS UM HAVING A COMPANY DRAGGED DOWN BY THESE INSANE HEALTH CARE COSTS
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET ACCESS TO AND UH HAVE IT UNIVERSAL
YEAH YEAH I YOU KNOW I- I WOULDN'T EVEN MIND SO MUCH IF THEY HAD A UM CORPORATION THAT IS FINANCED
THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT OR HAVE SOME SORT OF THERE CAN BE COMPETITION AS LONG AS THERE IS A UNIVERSAL PLAN I DON'T OPP- I DO NOT I'M NOT FOR ELIMINATING ALL PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE WHATSOEVER
BUT UM YOU KNOW BUT IF IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY
FOR THAT YOU CAN PAY BASED ON YOUR INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE
AND UH MORE FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE THE COST ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM RIGHT NOW
YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WORKING THIS COUNTRY IS HALF THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE AND WE'RE SEEING THAT'S NOT A LOT OF IT IS PRIVATE SECTOR TOO
UM I YOU KNOW IT'S THE GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS ATTACKED FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING PROPERLY
THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE I DON'T THINK THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S DOING MUCH BETTER THOUGH
I GET A CREDIT THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY SAID I COULD GET A CREDIT
BUT THE UH BUT IT IS IT'S GOING TO EXPIRE WHICH MEANS I'M PAYING UH I GET A SUM A SUM UH SUM OF THE MONEY BACK
BUT UM NOT ALL OF IT OF COURSE UM
I'M IN A WORST OFF POSITION THAN SOMEONE WHO IS EMPLOYED WHO GETS THEIR HEALTH HEALTH CARE TAKEN CARE OF BY THEIR EMPLOYER
UM BECAUSE I HAVE TO ALSO OBTAIN MY INSURANCE FROM IS A THIRD PARTY MIDDLE MAN TYPE DEAL
I HAVE TO GO TO GO THE SMALL BUSINESS SERVICE BUREAU AND PAY EIGHTY DOLLARS A YEAR JUST FOR THE RIGHT TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE
WORKS WELL FOR THEM BUT IT'S HORRIBLE FOR ME
YEAH I- I- I- I
YOU JUST CAN'T IT'S JUST IT'S SKY ROCKETING I MEAN WE'RE SEEING INCREASES EVERY YEAR TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT
AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND AND THE- AND THEN YOU HAVE THESE
UM-HUM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
HUH
YEAH I HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD UH BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF THAT PERSON I'M NOT KIDDING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAID IT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A SURPRISE
YEAH I THINK MAINLY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING WHAT'S POLITICALLY GOING ON UM IN THAT A- YOU KNOW
IN THAT ASPECT UH AS FAR AS LIKE NOW THE NEW HEALTH BILL THAT WENT THROUGH MINNESOTA UH BEING THAT IT IS THEIR NEIGHBORING STATE AND THAT I LIVED IN MINNESOTA AND MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE POLITICS THAT INVOLVED WITH THAT AND THAT BEING PASSED
BUT UM AS FAR AS POLITICS IN THE GRANDER UH
PART OF IT AS IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT UH ELECTION TYPE THINGS I'M NOT QUITE SURE EVEN IF I'M GOING TO VOTE UH
I- IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER EACH TIME AN ELECTION COMES UP LIKE THAT TO MAKE THE DECISION ON WHO WOULD BE THE BEST TO RUN UM
UM-HUM
SURE
EXACTLY
UM-HUM
SURE
UM-HUM SURE
HE MIGHT BE A A ONE OF THOSE SURE UH IT IT'S KIND OF WHEN YOU THINK BACK OF THE OLD POLITICS WHERE A DIRT FARMER
UH WHEN YOU THINK OF SOME OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE STRUGGLED TO GET TO THE TOP I MEAN THEY WERE NOT RICH IN IN ANY MEANS
AND IT HAS BEEN KIND OF IN THE PAST UH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE FIFTY YEARS THAT IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO GET I- INVOLVED WITH POLITICS THEY'VE HAD TO HAVE MONEY
AND YOU HAD TO HAVE THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO BE PAYING YOUR WAY UM
SO IT MAKES THE COMMON PERSON UH NOT TO SAY THAT A COMMON PERSON COULDN'T RUN FOR GOVERNMENT AND DO A A FABULOUS JOB BECAUSE HE'S GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE QUITE INTELLIGENT AND
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL EVER SEE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE A COMMON PERSON COULD EVER GET IN THERE THAT HAS GOOD MORAL STANDINGS AND UH HAS
UM YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF ABRAHAM LINKING LINCOLN AND YOU KNOW JUST TH- THE BACKGROUND OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN YOU KNOW TEACHING HIMSELF TO READ HE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE HE DIDN'T
YOU KNOW DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT UM YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT WAS REAL POPULAR TO DO AND TO GET PO- POLITICALLY INVOLVED AND AND HAVE MONEY HE DIDN'T COME FROM MONEY UM
AND NOW IT IT
UM-HUM SURE
UM-HUM
SO YOU REALLY KNOW A LOT OF HIS BACKGROUND
IT WAS THE BIG ONE IT'S THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS YEAH WHETHER OR NOT UH YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE CANDIDATES THAT WANT TO BECOME PRESIDENT I REALLY HAVE TO ASK THEM WHY YOU KNOW UM
IT'S THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD TO DO AND NOT ONLY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH FREEDOM TO MAKE CHOICES I MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE THE CONGRESS AND ALL OF THE A OTHER THINGS TO GET A BILL PASSED
AND SURE YOU CAN VETO UH VETO IT AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT THEN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE ALL THAT POWER AND I THINK ALONG TIME AGO PRESIDENTS DID HAVE A LOT OF POWER AND I THINK WE'RE
SO INTERESTING POLITICAL TRENDS OR EVENTS HUH
WELL I GUESS THE UH MOST INTERESTING ONE THAT'S UH GOING ON RIGHT NOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THIS UH PHENOMENA OF UM  UH ROSS PEROT
UH CAUGHT HIS INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT WITH DAVID FROST AND IT WAS THE THE FIRST TIME I HAD YOU KNOW HEARD UM YOU KNOW HIS VIEWS EXPRESSED BY HIMSELF I HAD HEARD OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE BELIEVED IN
BUT THE WHOLE PHENOMENA OF HIM COMING OUT OF UH LITERALLY NO WHERE NO PARTY UM AT LEAST NO APPARENT PARTY SUPPORT ON EITHER SIDE
IS PRETTY INTERESTING
UM-HUM
LIKE OUT OF NOWHERE YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH
UM-HUM
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THE DECISIONS SO FAR HAS BEEN FILTERED BY UH YOU KNOW PARTY POLITICS SO MUCH THAT WHEN THE CANDIDATES FINALLY GET PARTY APPROVAL PARTY SUPPORT AND THEREFORE GET PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC
THE THE CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY BEYOND WHAT UH MOST PUBLIC UH FEELS IS ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR
YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE COMMON CRITICISMS OF CLINTON IS UH GEE HE'LL SAY OR DO ANYTHING IN ORDER TO GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND AND UP UNTO THE POINT OF UH PEROT BEING A SERIOUS CANDIDATE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT
THAT WAS A REQUIREMENT OF BEING A A CONTENDER WITHIN THE PARTY IS IS TO HAVE DONE ALL THOSE THINGS
I MEAN HERE'S A HERE'S A GUY WHO FOR TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN WORKING TOWARD YOU KNOW GETTING THE PARTY NOMINATION AND AND PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE PRESIDENCY
AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE BOTH HE AND THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT ARE YOU KNOW PRETTY SERIOUSLY THREATENED BY SOMEBODY WHO COMES OUT OF
A WHOLE NONPOLITICAL ARENA
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM YEAH
A- AND YET EVEN HE WAS A A CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN IN THE SENSE THAT UH NOT ONLY DID HE F- UH FAIL IN BUSINESS TWICE WITH BANKRUPTCY AND AND FAILURE BUT HE LOST SOME EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS BEFORE HE FINALLY WON ONE
AND THE FIRST E- FIRST AND ONLY ELECTION HE WON WAS UM THE PRESIDENCY
UH STATE LEGISLATOR
YEAH THEN WHEN THEN WHEN HE FINALLY YOU KNOW DID WIN AN ELECTION UH YOU KNOW WAS THE PRESIDENCY YEAH
YEAH
BUT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE AWHILE I ALMOST FORGOT THE TOPIC BUT UH IT SEEMS LIKE I GET MOST OF MY NEWS FROM TELEVISION
I'M WE ONLY GET THE PAPER ON THE WEEKENDS AND SO I'M NOT MUCH OF A
OF A PAPER READER OR
BUT I I AND I'M DON'T RARELY LISTEN TO THE UM RADIO SO IT I GET MOST OF MY NEWS LIKE FROM DOCUMENTARIES LIKE FORTY EIGHT HOURS TWENTY TWENTY YOU KNOW I- THE NEWS AT NIGHT
NEW- NEWS IN THE AFTERNOON AND THAT KIND OF THING
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
HUH
UM
ARE YOU IN THE CAR QUITE A BIT OR
OH
OH
UH-HUH OH I SEE UM
YEAH I I I PRETTY MUCH AM AND I WATCH THE NEWS AT LEAST TWICE A DAY
SO UH IF I'VE MISSED SOMETHING AND AN- AND I'VE JUST RECENTLY DECIDED TO HOME WITH MY CHILDREN AND SO IT SEEMS AS IF I CATCH THE NEWS RISE RIGHT AS IT HA- HAPPENS YOU KNOW THERE WAS
UH THE EXPLOSIONS AND THAT KIND OF THING MY HUSBAND WILL SAY HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT AND I SAID YES IT HAPPENED AT SUCH AND SUCH TIME AND THAT'S SO THAT THAT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME SO I USUALLY FIND OUT WH- EXACTLY WHEN IT HAPPENS AND THAT KIND OF THING
UH NO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SINCE I'VE RECENTLY STAYED HOME
TH- THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENED YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THAT UH
I NOW THAT I'VE STAYED HOME I'M I'M USUALLY AWARE OF WH- WHEN THESE THINGS HAVE OCCURRED AND IT HAPPENED AND
RIGHT RIGHT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
HUM
RIGHT RIGHT IT KIND OF GIVES YOU THE WHOLE STORY OR MORE OF THE STORY THAT KIND OF THING
SO
UM
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
YEAH BUT I TRY AND CATCH MOST OF THOSE PROGRAMS  ON WEDNESDAYS AND FRIDAYS AND IF I MISS THEM I TRY AND
YOU KNOW I TRY AND AND UH TAPE THEM IF I'M OUT OR THAT KIND OF THING I TRY AND TAPE THEM AND
SO I CAN SIT BACK AND WATCH IT AND IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING UM
UM-HUM
Y- WELL YEAH PLUS I FIND I HAVE TO VIDEO TAPE QUITE A BIT OF THINGS IF I DON'T WANT ANY INTERRUPTIONS YEAH THAT KIND OF THING
UM IT SEEMS LIKE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
UNFORTUNATELY BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
UH-HUH WELL I- I GET A WEEKEND PAPER AS WELL AND UH IN ADDITION TO THAT I GET A LOCAL WEEKLY I- I LIVE IN SUBURB OF MILWAUKEE AND THEY GET THEY
HAVE COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS AROUND HERE SO THE LOCAL THEIR EXTREMELY LOCAL  STUFF UH IS IN THE LOCAL PAPER THAT COMES OUT ONCE A WEEK AND THEN I GET THE SUNDAY
UH MILWAUKEE JOURNAL BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ A PAPER UH MOSTLY THAT'S MY DIFFICULTY I UH I GET MY NEWS PRETTY MUCH FROM THE SAME SOURCE AS YOU DO ALTHOUGH I DO LISTEN TO NPR
WHICH HAS VERY GOOD AND THAT'S NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO WHICH HAS VERY GOOD UH COVERAGE OF THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NEWS I FEEL AND DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ANALYSIS AS WELL USUALLY
NO I'M NOT ACTUALLY UH BUT I CAN RUN MY RADIO IN MY OFFICE I- I I TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY AND WHEN I'M NOT
TEACHING IF I CHOOSE TO HAVE THE RADIO ON I CAN LISTEN TO THAT STATION SO
HO- HOW ARE YOU ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY AND FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND THE THINGS THAT YOU DO WATCH
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
IS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE NEWS THAT YOU'RE MOST INTERESTED IN IS IS THE TIMELY YOU NO- NOTING OF THE EVENTS AS THEY HAPPEN IS THAT WHAT YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN THE NEWS COVERAGE
UH-HUH
WELL I- I MYSELF UH THE THE REASON WHY I LISTEN TO NPR AND THE REASON WHY I WATCH MACNEIL LEHRER RATHER THAN THE
THAN THE NETWORK SH- NEWS SHOWS AT NIGHT ALTHOUGH I DO O- WATCH A LOCAL TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING NEWS WHICH SH- SH- YOU KNOW CARRIES OVER A LOT OF THE NATIONAL NEWS STORIES UH IS THAT
QUITE OFTEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT  THE NATIONAL DOESN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF ANALYSIS
THE LOCAL DOESN'T EITHER BUT I FEEL THAT MACNEIL LEHRER GET A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY INTO SOME SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY CURRENT
AND PERHAPS NEWSPAPERS DO THAT BUT AS I SAID I DON'T HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND READ A NEWSPAPER AND FRANKLY WHEN I HAVE READ A NEWSPAPER I HAVEN'T NOTICED THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS EITHER
SO UM
THERE'S THERE IS SOME DANGER TO THAT OF COURSE TOO BECAUSE IF THE ANALYSIS IS INACCURATE OR BIASED OR WHATEVER THEN
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD IS IT BUT
UH I LIKE A LITTLE MORE INDEPTH COVERAGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE MAYBE APPEALING TO YOU TOO ON SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TWENTY OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS
UM-HUM
YEAH
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD RATHER THAN SIMPLY BEING AWARE THAT
YOU KNOW THERE THAT AN EVENT HAS OCCURRED
I I LIKE TO STAND BACK AND GET A SLIGHTLY BIGGER PICTURE MAYBE BECAUSE I'M EASILY CONFUSED BY DETAIL I DON'T KNOW
SO
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN RIGHT
SO THOSE EVENING SHOWS ARE PROBABLY ALSO AT A TIME WHEN YOU'RE AT LIBERTY TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND BE IN FRONT OF THE TV SET FOR AWHILE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
OH YOU DO UH-HUH
UH-HUH WHEN IS YOUR GOOD WATCHING TIME
UH-HUH YES
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WH-
I HAVE OLDER CHILDREN AND GETTING DINNER ON THE TABLE I COME FROM THE EAST COAST AND I WAS
IT AMAZED ME WHEN I GOT OUT HERE TO THE MIDWEST AND FOUND OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE AN HOUR EARLIER IN TIME THEY STILL WATCH THE NEWS WHEN NEW Y-
YOU WANNA GO FIRST
OKAY UM ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS UH
DID WE DI- WHA- DO WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT A JUDGE MAKING THE DECISION AND I REALLY DON'T AGREE WITH THAT
I THINK THAT THE TRIAL BY JURY IS BETTER
UH YOU KNOW THAN E- HAVING A UNANIMOUS DECISION RATHER THAN TO HAVE ONE PERSON BE RESPONSIBLE
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY COULD BE OBJECTIVE IN EVERY CASE EVERY TIME
Y- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S IT
WELL I- I FEEL THE OTHER THING TOO UH THEY WERE SAYING UH YOU KNOW WHAT NEW WAYS COULD YOU COULD IT YOU YOU KNOW CHANGE THE SYSTEM
I- I REALLY THINK THAT UM WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME UH GOING THROUGH APPEAL AFTER APPEAL AFTER APPEAL AFTER APPEAL I MEAN I- IF YOU GO TO A TRIAL BY JURY
AND ESPECIALLY IF A PERSON HAS CONFESSED IF THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT YOU KNOW POINT BLANK IN THE CRIME THERE'S UH NO QUESTION IT'S BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT
YOU ALL THESE THINGS I MEAN YOU KNOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS UH OVER AND OVER AGAIN
AND IT CAN GO ON FOR TEN TWENTY YEARS I- I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS
I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM THAT ARE THE LAWYERS
I I'M SERIOUS AND I THINK THAT THE LAWYERS HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THA- HA- THAT EXIST IN THE IN THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM TODAY WITH PLEA BARGAINING
YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE IS
WELL
WELL I KNOW THA- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING BUT I THINK A LOT OF ALL OF THE WHOLE CRIMINAL SYSTEM IS MESSED UP
IN IN THAT REGARD I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO COMMIT UH CRIMES THAT THEY I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS EXACTLY BUT YOU KNOW THEY GET LESSER SENTENCES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE JAILS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW UH
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BUT I THINK THAT THE REASON THEY ARE FULL IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT
YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THA- WE WE DON'T HAVE UM WELL A LOT OF STATES DON'T HAVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
AND UM
I- I THINK THEY SHOULD I AND I THINK IF A PERSON IS GUILTY OF TAKING SOMEONE'S LIFE AND LIKE YOU SAY IT'S IT'S THERE'S NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER LIKE DRUNK DRIVERS THAT KILL PEOPLE AND UM
YOU KNOW ALL THEY THEY'RE CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS I- I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S THEY'VE THEY'VE TAKEN A LIFE AND IF THEY SHOULD PAY FOR IT WITH THEIR LIFE
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH REALLY
IT UH
YEAH
I KNOW THAT THE
UH-HUH
AN- I DON'T KNOW UH WHA- WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT BETTER
OH YEAH I- I I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL
IMAGINE THE GUILT THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE I MEAN IT BURNED OUT IS THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT YOU COULD UM YOU KNOW FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF IF YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT DAY AFTER DAY
NO REA- NOT REALLY
WELL WOU- DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A TRIAL IF THEY'RE CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS LIKE
I MEAN SUPPOSING I COME UP TO YOU AND I JUST POINT BLANK KILL YOU
IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S PREMEDITATED OR WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL IT'S I- I FEEL
NO YOU CAN START
UM-HUM
RIGHT
RIGHT THERE'S THERE TH- THI- THIS TOPIC IS KIND OF MOOT UM THERE THERE'S NO WAY WE WE COULDN'T SURVIVE IN A SY- IN A IN A JUROR SYST- IN A TRIAL SYSTEM WITHOUT A JURY UM
ONE MAN CAN NEVER BE ONE MAN ONE WOMAN CAN NEVER BE OBJECTIONABLE IN EVERY CASE
UM EVERY PERSON HAS THEIR OPINIONS AND THAT'S WHY JURY SELECTION IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT
UM
RIGHT
RIGHT THEY SHOULDN'T ALLOW AN APPEAL
YEP
UM-HUM
NO THAT'S RIGHT I WORK FOR A LAW FIRM I OUGHT I
RIGHT
WELL PLEA BAR- PLEA BARGAINING IS A DIFFERENT STORY
PLEA BARGAINING IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT THAT ACTUALLY PREVENTS TRIALS OR OR AT LEAST SPEEDS THEM UP
RIGHT
RIGHT
HUM
RIGHT
WE DO
RIGHT
RIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING AS AS FAR AS THE APPEAL UM PROCEDURE IS CONCERNED WE JUST HAVE THE CASE I'M I'M SURE YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF MARION BERRY
UM HIS FI- HIS LAST APPEAL WAS WAS DENIED TWO DAYS BEFORE HIS SENTENCE WAS UP
SO I MEAN HIS APPEAL WAS DENIED AND TWO DAYS LATER HE GOT OUT OF JAIL
FOR COCAINE POSSESSION BUT UM
THAT WAS ABSURD  THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO REASON THE APPEAL PROCESS SHOULD HAVE DRAGGED ON THAT LONG FOR A SIX MONTH SENTENCE
WELL
UH
THE THE ONLY THING I CAN I WAS YOU KNOW THE THE APPEAL PROCEDURE IS THE ONLY THING I CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF UM I LIKE I SAID AS FAR AS REMOVING OF THE JURY AND HAVING THE JUDGE SENTENCE THAT'S ABSURD THERE'S NO WAY THAT COULD WORK
UM
BUT
OH EXACTLY EXACTLY
RIGHT
NO ONE WOULD WANT THE JOB
UM
AND
YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THE YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT EVERY CASE
OH YEAH I I FEEL THAT EVERYONE IS EVERYONE IS UM ENTITLED TO A TRIAL BY JURY THAT THAT THAT RIGHT SH-
WELL I MEAN WERE THERE WITNESSES
RIGHT
RIGHT THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T REMOVE THE JURY REGARDLESS OF THE CASE I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE FIFTY PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE WATCHING  A MURDER TAKE PLACE AND YOU YOU'D STILL THERE'S STILL MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES
SEE WH- WHE- WHEN YOU'RE WITH A BIG COMPANY OR A BIG ORGANIZATION A LOT OF TIMES UH YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS ARE GOOD AND AND YOU KNOW THE PAY'S REGULAR
BUT UH WE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET TUNED IN TO WHAT'S GOING ON AND I- I- I THINK THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OR THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OTHER THAN WAGES THAT THAT UH THAT UH ANYBODY COULD GET IN UH IN DEALING IN A WITH A LARGE COMPANY
IS TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU YOU GET TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD TO TO DO
WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR FEELING ABOUT BENEFITS WHAT SORT OF BENEFITS WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET FROM A BIG COMPA-
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL TH- I
I WELL I- I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND UH ACTUALLY I WORK FOR THE FBI
AND UH AND SO WELL YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T GET TOLD FOR GOOD REASON
BUT UH BUT BASICALLY UH THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PROJECTS I'M AN ENGINEER
YOU KNOW I'M I'M A COTR AND SOMETIME- AND I WORKED IN THE SAME LAB WITH A GUY AND WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT EACH OTHER'S PROJECTS FOR TWO YEARS AND WE SHOULD'VE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOW COLLABORATING
AND IT DID- FOR TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T AND WH- WHICH WAS UH KIND OF STUPID
BUT UH BUT UH OUR ORGANIZATION IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE T- ON MONDAY UH WE'RE HAVING A FOR ALL UNCLASSIFIED PROGRAMS WE'RE WE'RE HAVING LITTLE TABLES PUT OUT IN FRONT OF YOU KNOW LAB IN THE HALLWAYS
AND EVERYB- ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO COME AROUND AND SEE WHAT SORT OF THINGS WE DO
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING
AND BU-
BUT UH BUT THAT SORT SORT OF THING BUT BUT I- BUT JU- I THINK YOU CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
AND AND BUT OF COURSE MOST TIME MOST THE TIME MANAGEMENT HAS A HARD TIME DISTRIBUTING OR GETTING THE WORD OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO MUST KNOW
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T REALLY COUNT IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM YOU MIGHT NOT GET TOLD FOR MONTHS OR YOU MIGHT YOU KNOW IF IT DOESN'T IMPACT YOU DIRECTLY OR IF YOUR MANAGEMENT DOESN'T THINK THAT
BUT BUT REGARD TO BENEFITS YOU KNOW MOST COMPANIES HAVE MOST BIG ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DECENT YOU KNOW BENEFITS LIKE RETIREMENT AND THAT SORT OF THING
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR I WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR UH SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU REACH YOU KNOW THE THE MID FIFTIES WA- IS
KEEPING A JOB UNTIL YOU RETIRE
UH AND ENGINEERS ARE UH  ARE BAGGAGE TO MOST UH UH AS THEY GET OLDER TO TO MOST COMPANIES
AND UH IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THE MILITARY IT WINDOWS OUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU THINK WELL BOY I'M GETTING MORE MONEY AND I'M GETTING MORE RESPONSIBILITY I'M DOING THIS BUT AS YOU CLIMB UP THAT TREE PRETTY SOON YOU'RE THE THE THE BRANCHES GET SMALLER ON THE TOP OF THE TREE
AND PRETTY SOON SOMEBODY FALLS OFF I- I'VE FALLEN OFF TWICE IN MY PRIVATE SECTOR
AND UH  AN- AND YOU KNOW I CAN GET UP
UM-HUM YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH HE MAY BE RETIRED
WELL SINCE I'M KIND OF ON THE THE OLDER SIDE YOU KNOW I- I- I JUST FEEL LIKE UH WHEN I START TALKING ABOUT BENEFITS I TALK ABOUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MEDICAL BENEFITS
UM
MY UM MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR MCDONALD DOUGLAS AND SO M- HIS BENEFITS HIS MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE SO EXCELLENT YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY GREAT
YOU KNOW I WORK FOR UM WES- A BANK WESTERN FINANCIAL
AND UH THEY DON'T LET ME KNOW REALLY ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON
EVEN SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE THINGS THAT I NEED TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW IT UNTIL THE NEXT HOUR AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN CHANGES MADE WE'RE CHANGING DEPARTMENTS WE'RE CHANGING POLICIES WE'RE CHANGING DOING OTHER KINDS OF THINGS WHICH TO ME IS IS DISTURBING
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE IF I- I DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO UH BE INVOLVED SINCE I'M PRETTY MUCH ON A LOW LEVEL YOU ARE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY MUCH ON A LOW LEVEL AS FAR AS UH
UH THE COMPANY IS CONCERNED BUT I I DO KIND OF LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND I THINK I CAN BE A BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE EMPLOYEE IF IF I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ALONG THAT LINE
OH MY GOSH
UM-HUM
OH
AND IT IT
YEAH THAT IS INTERESTING
EXACTLY
HM AH RIGHT
UM-HUM
OH
I KNOW IT IT SEEM TO BE KIND OF KIND OF SCARY YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU THINK OF UM
SEE MY SON'S EIGHTEEN RIGHT NOW AND HE HE'S UH HE WANTS TO GO INTO ENGINEERING
AND THE THE THE BRANCHES OF ENGINEERING THAT HE WANTS TO GO INTO IS NOW IS KIND OF OPEN AND HE'S INTERESTED IN BASICALLY THREE DIFFERENT AREAS BUT
UH IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO  TO TRY TO GIVE HIM ANY KIND OF ADVICE OR TO ADVISE HIM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HE NEEDS TO DO HIS OWN COURSE INVESTIGATION AND AND SEE WHAT HE CAN DO BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS
AND IN THIRTY YEARS IT BECOMES PRETTY CRITICAL I MEAN MY UM BROTHER-IN-LAW IS LIKE UM I MEAN HE'S SIXTY HE'S NOT READY TO RETIRE BUT HIS COMPANY IS IS C- IS UM IS UH CLOSING UP
AND BECAUSE OF THE DEFENSE CUTBACKS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND ALL THE NUCLEAR AND STUFF WHICH IS WHAT HE WHAT HE WAS WORKING ON HE'S GETTING CUT BACK AND HE'S NOT READY TO RETI-
WELL MY BASIC IDEA ON DEALING WITH THE US BUDGET AS UNREALISTIC AND  AS IT MAY BE
IS TO FIRST OF ALL PUT AN END TO THESE KINDS OF UH HIDDEN USER FEES AND UH
UM OTHER TYPES OF UH TRICKS THAT HAVE BEEN USED
TO HELP MASK THE SIZE OF THIS THING LET'S GET A HOLD OF WHAT THE REAL TRUE SIZED OF IT IS AND THEN LET'S DEAL WITH IT IMMEDIATELY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE EVEN IF IT MEANS SOME SHORT TERM HIGHER TAXES
TO GET IT DOWN AND UH THEN LET'S TRY TO MAKE SOME REFORMS WITH THE THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMUNITY HA HA
TRY AND MAKE IT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE
YOU KNOW
I- I JUST KEEP SEEING UNFORTUNATELY THE P- A LOT OF THE PROBLEM WHY WE HAVE THIS DEFICITS BALLOON ESPECIALLY DURING THE EIGHTIES IS JUST BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
BOUGHT INTO THIS NOTION THAT WELL WE CAN JUST UH WE DON'T NEED A HIGHER TAXES CERTAINLY NOT THEY GET ENOUGH OF OUR MONEY ALREADY AND
THE DEFICIT DOESN'T SEEM TO AFFECT ME IN MY DAILY LIFE AND ROUTINE SO SO WHAT
YEAH I KNOW BUT YOU NOTICE THESE PEOPLE ARE ONLY NOW STARTING TO THINK AHEAD
UM-HUM
YEAH
UM-HUM
YEAH THE ONLY THE ONLY PROBLEM COMES DOWN AS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SCREAM AND YELL ESPECIALLY THE AARP BECAUSE THEY WERE YELLED THAT WELL WE PAID FOR THIS ALL ALONG WAS THIS A HIDDEN SECRET TAX THE WHOLE TIME THAT'S OUR MONEY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE BACK TO US NOW
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
WELL YEAH WE HAVE THAT OUT HERE IN NEW YORK TOO YOU KNOW WITH GOVERNOR MARIO KING MARIO AND
THE LEGISLATURES ARE OPPOSING PARTIES ARE CONTROLLED BY OPPOSING PARTIES WHICH MEANS BASICALLY EVERY YEAR WE HAVE A SCREAM AND TERRIFIED OVER THE BUDGET
IN THIS STATE WHICH IS DELAYED ETERNALLY AND THEN THEY WANT TO KILL EACH OTHER YOU KNOW
UM-HUM
WELL I HAVE TO I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WOULD BE VERY IN FAVOR
OF
A SITUATION WHERE THE REVENUE GENERATION ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE IRS
ARE MONITORED AND
SPENDING FOR YEAR
X PLUS ONE
CAN GO NO HIGHER THAN THE REVENUES BROUGHT IN DURING YEAR X
SO THAT UH FORGET ABOUT THIS BALANCED BUDGET THIS WOULD IMMEDIATELY FORCE THEM
TO SAY WELL GEEZ UM YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WAS A BAD YEAR AND WE'VE ONLY GOT YOU KNOW WE ONLY TOOK IN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS UH
I REALIZE THAT I'M OFF BY A FACTOR OF ABOUT FIVE BUT  WE ONLY TOOK IN TWO HUNDRED MILLION EVEN THOUGH THIS YEAR IS GOING BETTER WE CAN STILL ONLY SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOUR KIDS
WELL I- I THINK THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN THAT
IT'S MADE UP OF A BUNCH OF SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS HAVE STARTED TO EXERT MORE POWER
UH FOR INSTANCE RETIREES THEY'VE STARTED TO UP SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IT USED TO BE SO SOCIAL SECURITY WAS JUST THE FINAL SAFETY NET
BUT IT'S NOT THAT WAY ANYMORE UH NOW YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE
UH SIXTY THOUSAND IN TAX FREE INCOME BECAUSE THEY INVESTED WISELY DURING THEIR WORKING YEARS AND THEY'RE STILL COLLECTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND ALL OF THAT MONEY IS TAX FREE
I'M SORRY I THINK THAT UM ALL OF THE INVESTMENT INCOME REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU INVESTED SHOULD BE TAXABLE
AND THE THING IS THAT YOU SHOULD LOOSE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS BASED ON HOW MUCH INCOME YOU HAVE
UH YEAH I- I- I- I AGREE I THINK THAT SOCIAL SECURITY OUGHT TO BE DONE AWAY WITH AND PUT INTO THE UH  TAX
AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS SO GO AHEAD AND PUT IT IN THERE AND UH
UH YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY'RE TREATING IT AS A TAX THEY'RE TREATING THE MONEY AS TAX REVENUE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE PUTTING ASIDE FOR LATER USE IT GOES INTO THE GENERAL FUND WHETHER OR NOT
IT WANTS TO TO GO THERE THAT'S THAT'S WERE IT GOES AND IT'S BEING USED SO I MEAN UM
UH MY PERSONAL OPINION OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST INSTITUTED TERM LIMITS ON THE UH SENATE AND HOUSE FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO HAVE
UH THE AFFECT THAT OF COURSE ALL THE THE CAREER POLITICOS HERE SAY OH MY GOD YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF AMATEURS RUNNING THE STATE LEGISLATURE
WELL WELL SO WHAT
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT WHAT WE MAY END UP WITH WITH THE TERM LIMITS IS YOU GET MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT
YOU GET MORE PEOPLE SEEING HOW IT SHOULD WORK AND I THINK WHAT THAT WILL DO IS THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE
WE'VE GOT TO COMPROMISE WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON SOMETHING WE NEED MORE OF A VISION AND LESS OF UH GOD I'LL GRAB MY MONEY AND DO EVERYTHING I CAN
UM
IN TEXAS THEY DO HAVE THE UM CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND UM
I- I JUS- I I'M PROBABLY ONE THAT HAS TO AGREE WITH IT TOO UM
THERE'RE
A- SOME THINGS THAT GO ON THAT I JUST FEEL THAT
I- I JUST FEEL THAT THAT THAT THAT IS A NEED I DON'T I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT WAY EITHER BUT I JUST FEEL TH- THAT
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS A CONSEQUENCE YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM-HUM
WELL MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON BUT I I JUST FEEL THAT THAT
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT NEEDS TO STAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM NOT ALL STATES HAVE THEM BUT I
YOU KNOW WAS THAT WAS THAT THE I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS IN WAS THAT THE MAN THAT THAT CLAIMED HE WAS ABUSED OR
AND THAT HE HAD SOME HE
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND HOW LONG HAD HE BEEN A- APPEALING HOW LONG WAS THAT
GOSH BOY
YEAH BOY
WELL I MEAN AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT IT RARELY DOES HAPPEN YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT USED THAT OFTEN YOU KNOW AT LEAST HERE IN TEXAS BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO STAY I REALLY DO
YEAH
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
UM-HUM
UM-HUM
YEAH
MY SISTER AND I WERE WONDERING ABOUT THIS RECENTLY BECAUSE A AN OLD FRIEND OF OURS IN CALIFORNIA THIS JUS- HAPPENED ABOUT A WEEK AGO UM HER HUSBAND JUST KILLED HER AND WE'RE WONDERING IF THAT HAS AN EFFECT
IF THAT IF SOMETHING DOES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
YOU KNOW DOES IT HAPPEN WITH THAT WITHIN THAT UH
I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH AND UH I HAVE AN UNCLE THAT IS AN ATTORNEY THAT DEFENDS UH PEOPLE ON
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH PUBLICITY IT'S GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BUT CALIFORNIA WE JUST PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH
UM FOR I THINK IT WAS A DOUBLE MURDER UH TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION UH TO THE DETAILS OF IT UM
BUT IT HAD A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OUT HERE UH BASICALLY BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE LIKE TO PROTEST ABOUT EVERYTHING UM
BUT I AGREE I BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS THE BEST WAY TO GO UM
THE BIG DISAGREEMENT I HAVE IS THAT
IN CALIFORNIA THE APPEALS PROCESS UH IS SO EXTENSIVE AND TAKES SO LONG
THAT YOU END UP SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN LIKE TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PUT SOMEBODY TO DEATH FOR FOR A CRIME
AND I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S RIDICULOUS I MEAN IF YOU CAN YOU KNOW Y- Y- THE TRIAL IS SUPPOSED TO PROVE YOU KNOW WITHIN A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE PERSON IS GUILTY
AND THEN THEY HAVE APPEALS WELL THAT'S FINE BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN A FEW YEARS I MEAN I SHOULD THINK TWO OR THREE YEARS MAXIMUM YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EITHER PUT THE GUY TO DEATH
OR HE'S INNOCENT I MEAN IT'S IF HE'S GUILTY FOR FOR YOU KNOW MULTIPLE MURDERS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH HE WAS LIKE UM THE THE THE DEFENSE THE DEFENSE THEY'RE WERE GIVING GIVEN WAS THAT UH LIKE HIS MOTHER HAD HAD BEEN AN ALCOHOLIC WHEN WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH HIM AND SO HE HE WASN'T YOU KNOW MENTALLY COMPETENT OR ANYTHING ELSE
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS AND AND THE COURT FOUND HIM COMPETENT UM AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS THE BEST DEFENSE THEY COULD COME UP WITH
I FORGET I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE YEARS OR SOMETHING
IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY OUTRAGEOUS
YEAH
I THINK IN GENERAL UH
PUNISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS A LOT WEAKER THAN IT SHOULD BE I MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES IS KIND OF LIKE THE DOG POOPS ON THE CARPET AND YOU WAIT THREE MONTHS AND THEN YOU PUT HIS NOSE IN IT AND SPANK HIM FOR IT
YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO
I MEAN YOU TAKE THESE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING VIOLENT CRIMES MOST OF THEM NOT ALL BY ANY MEANS BUT YOU KNOW A LARGE PERCENTAGE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING VERY MUCH DAY TO DAY IN THE FIRST PLACE
UM THEY DON'T REALLY SEE PAST NEXT WEEK MUCH LESS NEXT YEAR AND TO SAY YOU KNOW WELL IF I KILL SOMEBODY THEN A DECADE FROM NOW I MIGHT FACE THE PUNISHMENT
THAT'S NOT REAL IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL IMPACT ON THEM
UM-HUM
UM Y- YOU MEAN WOULD HE BE PUT TO DEATH FOR THAT
UM LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GENERALLY
YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S IT'S ONLY THE MOST BRUTAL TYPES OF THINGS USUALLY WHERE IT'S MULTIPLE YOU KNOW
IF IF THEY CAN SAY THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WELL HE WAS JUST YOU KNOW TEMPORARILY INSANE BECAUSE OF SOME DOMESTIC SQUABBLE THEN
YOU KNOW THEY'LL THEY'LL GIVE HIM YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS WITH WITH PAROLE IN IN TWELVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH-HUH
AND IN WHAT WAY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
RIGHT
R- YEAH RIGHT
SEE I- I YEAH AND I ALSO THOUGHT THAT UM THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH WITH COLLEGE WORK AND
THEY DIDN'T
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
WHEN DO THEY ASSUME THIS IS GONNA BE PROPOSED OR MANDATORY OR WHEN WHEN I WHAT WHAT YEAR ARE THEY LOOKING AT
UH-HUH
UM-HUM
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR LINE
UH WHAT AGE GROUP I- ARE ARE THEY LOOKING AT
EIGHTEEN YEAH THAT SEEMS NORMALLY THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH COLLEGE I WOULD THINK
I MOVED MAYBE THAT IS THAT'S PART OF IT
OH
OH HM
RIGHT
UM-HUM
YEAH
WELL THAT'S KIND OF SCARY
THAT'S KIND OF SCARY
RIGHT
YEAH
OH UH-HUH HM
HE'S HE'S HELPED OUT IN A LOT OF WAYS YEAH HE'S HE'S FROM DALLAS OR HE'S IN THE DALLAS AREA AND UH HE'S VERY WELL KNOWN AROUND HERE SO
UH-HUH
YEAH I- I
YEAH YEAH I- I THINK HE'S GOT A VERY GOOD CHANCE SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE PULLING FOR HIM
SO
I DON'T KNOW  YOU WORK IN THE UM COMPUTER BUSINESS THAT WHAT YOU SAID
OH OKAY WELL MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR UM TEXAS INSTRUMENTS AND SO UM THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE SWITCHBOARD
OKAY UH MANDATORY SERVICE YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
UH BECAUSE WE'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION TO  TO UH ALLOW UH INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE UH IN SERVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE COULD DO THAT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE COULD AVOID WINDING UP A SLAVE STATE
IT'S I LIKE THE IDEA
WELL  WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T DO IT
BUT TO USE FORCE UM REALLY SETS US A A IT IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT YOUR BODY THERE'S A TITLE TO YOUR BODY AND THAT TITLE BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND YOU ARE NOT A FREE AMERICAN CITIZEN
THE IDEA ITSELF OF SERVICE IS GOOD
AND WHEN SOMEONE IS SAY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT SURE ABOUT COLLEGE OR OUT OF COLLEGE AND NOT READY TO GO INTO A CAREER AND THEY'RE NOT COMMITTED TO HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT THAT'S THE BEST TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO WORK THAT DOESN'T PAY VERY WELL
YEAH UNLESS IT WERE TIED DIRECTLY
YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE WERE STUDYING SOMETHING UH LET'S SAY TAKE SOMETHING OBSCURE SOMEBODY WAS STUDYING ECONOMICS THE STATE DEPARTMENT COULD OFFER TO SEND THEM TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR TWO YEARS TO TEACH THEM HOW TO RUN THEIR COUNTRY
AS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE RIGHT
BUT IN REALITY I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD WIND UP WITH IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL WHERE THEY WOULD SEE ALL THESE BODY COUNTS THAT THEY CAN USE TO FOR THEIR OWN WILL AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK
WELL THEY'RE NOT IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED AND IT'S SORT OF A TOPIC OF DEBATE EVERY TIME IT COMES UP IT GETS VOTED DOWN THE UH PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-MILITARY OPPOSE IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE MILITARY INTO SOMETHING ELSE
AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-CONSTITUTION OPPOSE IT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE YOU TO JOIN THE MILITARY UNLESS THE UNITED STATES IS ACTUALLY UNDER ATTACK
AH THEY'VE GOT A NOISY LINE
YEAH WELL IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
UH OH EIGHTEEN THE DRAFT AGE YEAH
YEAH IT IS MY LINE I WAS ON A RADIO PHONE
ALL RIGHT THAT'S BETTER YEAH NO THERE THEY THEY FIGURE THAT THEY CAN DRAFT YOU AT EIGHTEEN AGE THEY USUALLY DO DRAFT YOU AT NINETEEN AND THAT'S THE AGE THEY'RE LOOKING AT
AND OF COURSE THEY'RE THIS ONE THE WOMEN WOULD BE EQUALLY GRABBED AND THEY'RE ALMOST ON THE VERGE OF SAYING THAT YOU IF YOU'RE GONNA DRAFT MEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DRAFT WOMEN AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT THEM IN FRONT OF THE GUNS JUST THE SAME
SO UH IF YOU'RE NEAR THAT AGE OR YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS UH YOU KNOW BE AWARE OF THAT
YEAH
OH OKAY
YEP AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM SENT OFF TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO HELP DEFEND BUSH FROM SADDAM AFTER BUSH GETS DONE ARMING HIM
YOU KNOW WE ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THAT A YEAR AFTER THE FACT
SO IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN IN DOUBT DON'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT AT ALL IT'S REALLY REACHED THAT POINT
HEY YOU'RE IN PEROT COUNTRY I'M REALLY THINKING THAT THIS GUY MIGHT BE GOOD FOR US
I'VE BEEN IT IT SEEMED DANGEROUS I THOUGHT IS THE GUY A CLOSET FASCIST AND THEN I FIND OUT THAT HE HELPED RID THE UNITED STATES OF THE GABLERS
YEAH
WELL I'M IN THE COMPUTER BIZ TOO SO I KNOW HE'S WELL KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY THEY UH I- I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR HIM AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF HE COULD GET PEOPLE INTERESTED AND ENCOURAGED AND TO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ACTUALLY FOR US THEN I'M FOR HIM
I MEAN IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY I'M GONNA VOTE FOR BROWN JUST BECAUSE I KIND OF LIKE BROWN AND HIS ATTITUDE BUT WHEN UH WHEN IT REALLY COMES DOWN IN THE FALL I THINK I KNOW WHERE IT'S GONNA GO
UM-HUM
YEAH
YOU KNOW THIS
YEAH I'M AN END USER I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO USE MACINTOSHES AND HOW TO BUY EQUIPMENT AND DESKTOP PUBLISHING MAGAZINE PRODUCTION AND THINGS RELATED TO THAT
UH-HUH
