EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE REVENUES STREAM WENT TO ANOTHER STATE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A AS A CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER(sw04372-B_010727-011574)
WELL I THINK THAT IF IF POLICY IS ESTABLISHED AND A HALF OF MECHANISM IS PUT INTO PLACE TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IN THIS FASHION(sw04372-B_014832-016168)
THEN I DON'T ARGUE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER TO REMEMBER THAT THOUGH I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF STATE I NEED IT IS YOU'RE ROCKS THE RECEIPT AND MAKE OUT A CHECK FOR SIX PERCENT AND SEND IT TO PENNSYLVANIA(sw04372-B_016168-017436)
RIGHT BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT BUSINESSES DO THAT THE BUSINESS THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS THING FROM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING APPROPRIATE SALES TAX AND FORWARDING INTO THE STATE AND QUESTION THAT'S COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE BURDEN SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE CONSUMER(sw04372-B_017600-019005)
